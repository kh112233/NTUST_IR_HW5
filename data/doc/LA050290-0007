SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Nancy Hoover Hunter's retrial on fraud and conspiracy charges linked to the 
collapse of the J. David &amp; Co. investment firm, due to begin Tuesday, was 
postponed for a week after a brief hearing in San Diego federal court. 
U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam put off the start of Hunter's trial until 
May 8 to give defense attorney Richard Marmaro, out of state on another case, 
time to finish the other matter. 
Hunter, a former Del Mar mayor, was convicted in December -- after an 
eight-month trial -- of four counts of tax evasion connected to the giant J. 
David fraud, which cost some 1,500 investors about $80 million. In March, 
Gilliam sentenced her to 10 years in federal prison. 
She faces a retrial on 192 other counts, primarily fraud and conspiracy 
stemming from her role at the failed La Jolla firm.
