  [Text] Police have seized 90 kilos of the drug Ecstasy with 
a street value of &pound;6 million. 
  Five men--two of them Dutch--were arrested in raids in 
Ilford, Chingford and Woodford, Essex, when &pound;1 million 
worth 
of counterfeit Spanish pesetas was also recovered. 
  A spokeswoman for the South Eastern Regional Crime Squad 
said 
the weekend raids were not connected with the seizure of 
&pound;15 
million of forged notes and printing equipment at a printing 
works in Islington, north London, on Sunday. 
  Four men will appear at Redbridge magistrates court, east 
London, today in connection with that discovery. 
  Lithographic plate maker Paul Matthew Carter, 36, of Sussex; 
printers Robert David Brown, 44, of Loughton, Essex, and Steven 
Victor Ross, 20, of Romford, Essex, and company director Robert 
Barry Kalmanson, 46, of Stanmore, Middlesex, are charged with 
conspiracy to contravene the Forgery and Counterfeit Act. 
  Officers also found bundles of forged Irish, American, 
Spanish, Nigerian and Romanian currency in the Islington raid. 
Details of the notes will be passed to banks in each of the 
countries involved. 
  In the past year, the squad has found &pound;13 million in 
forged notes.
