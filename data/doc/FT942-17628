FT  02 APR 94 / Scottish Eurocentral terminal virtually complete
Scotland's Eurocentral freight terminal for the Channel tunnel is virtually
complete at Mossend in Lanarkshire, James Buxton writes.
When the tunnel opens one freight train a day will leave Mossend with
Scottish exports. It will be split and mixed with trains from other
terminals across the UK to form new trains destined for continental Europe.
The Mossend terminal, which is near the M8 motorway and the enterprise zone
that has been created to help Lanarkshire recover from the disappearance of
its steel industry, has received a strong level of inquiries from
prospective users.
Personal-computer manufacturers and whisky companies are expected to use it
for Continental shipments.
The terminal is about 400 miles from the Channel tunnel, the distance at
which rail freight is thought to become economic compared with road.
