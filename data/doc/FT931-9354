FT  15 FEB 93 / Plea for new Bonn rules on citizenship
FOREIGNERS living in Germany should be given easier access to citizenship as
well as the possibility of dual citizenship, a senior member of the
governing Christian Democratic Union said at the weekend.
The move is likely to increase pressure among the CDU, and the Christian
Social Union, its sister party in Bavaria, to support eventually the
principle of an immigration law.
Mr Heiner Geissler, the former chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary
faction, said that citizenship acquired through 'birth and blood was
disgraceful'. Citizenship is automatically granted to an individual if
either parent is German.
The strongest support for easier access to citizenship, which would
inevitably lead to a debate about introducing an immigration law, has come
from the liberal Free Democratic party, the junior coalition partner, and
the opposition Social Democratic party. However, the CSU continues to oppose
any relaxation of current citizenship laws, which allow foreigners the
chance for full German citizenship after 15 years.
Mr Geissler's calls follow a wave of attacks on foreigners by extreme
right-wing groups. Yesterday, a fire bomb was thrown into a Turkish-owned
shop, injuring 10 people.
European interior ministers will meet in Budapest today to discuss policy on
refugees, immigration and asylum.
