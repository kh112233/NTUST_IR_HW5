SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA is amending the regulations in 5.62 

Issuance of initial emergency permit orders and notices of confirmation of effective date of final regulations on
food matters

 (21 CFR 5.62) to include foods for animal as well as human consumption, and to give the Director and Deputy Director,
CVM authority to issue initial emergency permit orders under 508.5 (21 CFR 508.5) and to confirm the effective
date of final regulations on animal food matters.


This document is issued as a final rule because the rulemaking requirements in 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply to rules of agency
organization, procedure, or practice.

Further redelegation of the authority delegated is not authorized. Authority delegated to a position by title may
be exercised by a person officially designated to serve in such position in an acting capacity or on a temporary basis.
