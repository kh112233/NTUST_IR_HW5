SAINTS' JACKSON HAS SURGERY, OUT AT LEAST 4 WEEKS 
New Orleans Saints linebacker Rickey Jackson underwent 3 1/2 hours of 
reconstructive surgery Thursday on the cheekbone he fractured in a car wreck, 
and a team spokesman said he is expected to be out at least four weeks. 
Jackson narrowly escaped death early Monday when he drove a borrowed Corvette 
under the back of a flatbed truck on U.S. 61 about three miles from his home 
north of New Orleans. Investigators said he was going more than 100 m.p.h. 
The official police report, issued Thursday, said there was no evidence Jackson 
had been drinking. He was charged with reckless operation of a motor vehicle. 
A spokesman for the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Dept. said the truck was going 
about 45 m.p.h. when struck from behind by Jackson. 
The impact flipped the truck, which landed on its wheels. Neither the driver of 
the truck nor a passenger were seriously injured. 
The Corvette could still be driven, the sheriff spokesman said, and Jackson, 
who was alone, went down the highway to a shopping center to telephone police. 
However, before he could call 911, a deputy saw the car and stopped.
