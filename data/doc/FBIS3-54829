  [Text] Tallinn, January 3 -- Estonian economy took a 
remarkable leap ahead in 1993, Siim Kallas, President of the 
Bank of Estonia said in his commentary to commercial Radio 2. 
  The biggest surprise was that Estonia's exports doubled in 
1993, Kallas said while adding that a three-per-cent increase in 
gross national product was a very good result. Kallas forecast 
similar growth for 1994. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar told the same broadcast that 
Estonia 
made considerable progress towards normal society and state. 
  Last year was successful to Estonia both economically and 
politically, Laar said while adding that, hopefully, Estonia and 
the European Union would conclude free trade agreement in 1994. 
Estonia should also reach an agreement with NATO, Laar added.
