UCLA'S SMITH CHALLENGES TORONTO TESTIMONY 
UCLA track Coach Bob Larsen said Thursday that Francis' remarks were erroneous 
when he said it was impossible to compete in track and field at the world-class 
level without the aid of chemical substances. 
Larsen said that four of his athletes, Steve Lewis, Danny Everett, Mike Marsh, 
and Kevin Young, represented the United States in the Seoul Olympics and were 
tested extensively during training and while competing, especially Lewis, the 
gold medalist in the 400 meters. 
"We're on e of the few schools that test for anabolic steroids, or any 
performance-enhancing drugs," Larsen said. "It's random unannounced (testing) 
all during the training phases and going into the competition phases. When 
Francis said it was impossible to compete at a world-class level without 
performance enhancing drugs, I know that's wrong. I don't know how many people 
are clean, but I know our four people were clean." MAL FLORENCE
