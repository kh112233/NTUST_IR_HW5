  [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- Representatives from 
three Taiwan conservation organizations will be allowed to speak 
at a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
(CITES) meeting to be held Monday [21 March] in Geneva. 
  Representatives from the Society of Wildlife and Nature, the 
Beautiful Taiwan Foundation and the Green Consumers' Foundation 
are expected to detail Taiwan's efforts to end its illegal trade 
in endangered species parts and products during the CITES 
meeting open only to non-government organizations (NGO). 
  The NGO meeting gives non-CITES members an opportunity to 
explain their wildlife conservation efforts to CITES delegates. 
The meeting is sponsored by the British Environmental 
Investigation Agency (EIA), according to beautiful Taiwan 
Foundation Chairman Ted Ting. 
  As of Saturday, representatives from 10 NGO's had applied to 
speak during the meeting. 
  Meanwhile, officials from the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation 
and 
the Green Consumers' Foundation announced in Jerusalem earlier 
this week that they will join an Asian region CITES task force 
to combat illegal trade in wildlife products, Ting said. 
  Israel, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan and Uzbekistan have 
all 
expressed interest in joining the task force, Ting added.
