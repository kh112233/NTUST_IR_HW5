  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 08, BNS -- Estonia theoretically can 
join the European Union [EU] only in 1998, but in reality this 
is likely to happen even later, said Ivar Raig, the head of the 
government's work group for issues of joining the EU. 
  The work group to prepare Estonia's application for 
membership in the European body was set up in December. 
  Members in the group will gather and prepare data on whether 
it is advisable for Estonia to join the EU, when and where to do 
it, what are the things Estonia still has to do to measure up to 
the EU standards, and what can the EU offer to Estonia, and 
Estonia, to the EU, Raig said. 
  The topics all together number 23 and are divided between 
the 
groups for foreign and security policy, for economic and social 
policy, and for political decisions and legislation, he said. 
  The documents to be drawn up will be also circulated to 
shape 
a positive attitude toward Estonia within the EU. The materials 
must reflect Estonia's readiness to join the Union, Raig said, 
reminding that Estonia's future membership has to be ratified by 
each of the EU full members. 
  Raig said the materials must be submitted by March 31. Also 
to be elected is an international group of experts to sponsor 
Estonia's moves in Brussels. 
  He said his work group is also preparing for an 
international 
congress due on Oct. 5-7. 
  The people's opinion will be asked in a referendum at the 
time when Estonia already has obtained an associate member's 
status, i.e. not before 1998, Raig added. 
  The work group meets once a month, but the board of the 
group 
is meeting more often, he said.
