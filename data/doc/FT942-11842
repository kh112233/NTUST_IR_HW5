FT  04 MAY 94 / Tales of the tunnel
Transport secretary John MacGregor was wired up yesterday to a high-tech
exhibition celebrating the completion of the Channel tunnel. The exhibits,
including the 'talking pictures' shown here, will be on show at the Science
Museum in London until September. 'This exhibition will help visitors
understand how the tunnel system works,' he said.
Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, the company sponsoring the
exhibition, looked forward to an era in which the tunnel would be 'part of
the British way of life, and our children will find it odd that we ever did
without it'.
