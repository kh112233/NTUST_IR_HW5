FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Iraqi arms documents released
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has supplied more than 10,000 pages of
documents to the judicial inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair, including
all those requested, MPs were told yesterday, David Owen writes.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, made the disclosure as
he sidestepped a question from Mr Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP, about the
extent of his knowledge of the affair.
He asked whether Mr Heseltine had admitted to Lord Justice Scott, who is
heading the inquiry, that he knew when he signed a public-interest immunity
certificate relating to Matrix Churchill, the machine-tool manufacturer,
that Mr Paul Henderson, a director, had been supplying intelligence
information.
Public hearings are expected to end before the summer recess.
