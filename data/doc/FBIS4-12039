  [Text] Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has said: 
We in Jordan absolutely welcome the call of Faysal al-Husayni, 
head of the Palestinian team to the peace negotiations, for the 
formation of a joint, resident Jordanian-Palestinian committee 
in permanent session. The purpose of this committee will be to 
promote joint coordination and spell out, in detail, the 
frameworks, form, and extent of joint cooperation. 
  In a statement to AL-DUSTUR, Dr. al-'Anani said His Majesty 
King Husayn and the Jordanian Government have constantly been 
calling for continued Jordanian-Palestinian coordination. He 
pointed out that the Jordanian-Palestinian committees formed 
earlier should be in permanent session to coordinate stands 
between the two sides, especially with regard to the question of 
Jerusalem. 
  He added: We are waiting for the Palestinian side to name 
the members of the committee called for by Faysal al-Husayni. 
  The Jordanian Foreign Ministry has also welcomed the 
formation of this committee. A responsible source said the 
formation of a permanent committee is very important for 
continued, fruitful Jordanian-Palestinian coordination in the 
face of Israeli policy and negotiators. 
  He added that coordination should not be limited to the 
Jordanian and Palestinian sides, but should extend to all the 
Arab parties taking part in the peace process.
