FT  28 JAN 92 / British Gas may buy power station
BRITISH GAS will almost certainly buy one of the four power stations on sale
in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Office said yesterday.
A partnership between Tractebel, the Belgian power conglomerate, and
Associated Energy Supply (AES), the US power company, is likely to buy two
more stations. The fourth will probably go to a management buyout team.
The sale of the stations will be an important step in the privatisation of
Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE), the electricity generator and supplier.
A draft order providing the legislative basis for NEI's privatisation was
passed in the Commons last night.
NIE's four power stations will be sold as individual units. The company's
electricity supply business will remain intact and will be sold to the
public in November.
British Gas is expected to buy Ballylumford, Northern Ireland's largest
power station. AES, which has invested in a new power station in Kent, and
Tractebel are expected to buy Kilroot, the newest station, and the old
Belfast West station.
The fourth, Coolkeeragh, will probably be bought by management.
There will initially be no electricity pool - wholesale market - in Northern
Ireland and the purchasers of the four stations will receive 15-year
contracts to supply NIE.
They will, however, still compete with each other through a bidding system.
Another power station is likely to be built after NIE next month invites
bidders to extend the life of existing stations or provide an alternative.
A Labour government would not seek to return a privatised Northern Ireland
Electricity to public ownership, Mr James Marshall, a frontbench spokesman,
told the Commons last night.
