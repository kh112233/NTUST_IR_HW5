FT  21 FEB 94 / Markets: A difficult task for testimony - Global Investor
Fundamental US economic factors should simultaneously be strengthening the
dollar over the next few months. The economy is expanding at a relatively
strong clip - many economists are forecasting GDP growth of 3 to 3 1/2 per
cent this year - and the Federal Reserve has started to tighten monetary
policy.
However, the central bank, which raised the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis
points at the start of this month, may have to tighten another notch or two
before it allays the jitters which have overtaken the Treasury bond market
over the past few weeks.
After a sharp drop in price on Friday, the benchmark 30-year issue ended
last week with a yield of 6.62 per cent, up from 6.40 a week earlier, and
some market analysts now think yields could rise to between 6.75 and 7 per
cent before stabilising and reversing direction, and that could feed through
to a significant dip in equity indices.
The bond market has yet to be convinced that inflationary pressures are
under control. This was graphically demonstrated on Thursday when bearish
traders brushed aside a healthy January reading for the consumer price index
and focussed instead on a much more narrow measure of price increases, from
the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Board, which showed a significant increase.
The week's fall in the dollar relative to the yen will also have fed fears
of imported inflation.
The market may not regain its composure until there is a run of slow-growth
statistics, or until after further rounds of Fed tightening, which could
nevertheless be bearish for bonds in the short term. Many analysts expect
the Fed Funds rate to rise from 3.25 per cent to 3.5 over the next two
months, with some predicting 4 per cent by mid-year.
However, short-term sentiment could be powerfully affected on Tuesday by Mr
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, who will deliver his semi-annual
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony on monetary policy to Congress. At the very
least, he is expected to reaffirm his recent testimony before a
Congressional committee that the strength of the economic expansion means
the Fed must become less 'accomodative.'
Huffing and puffing the Yen up
Is the time fast approaching to sell the Japanese Yen? The question is
prompted by the surge in the currency relative to the dollar over the past
week following the breakdown of US-Japanese trade talks and threats by
Washington to take fresh trade sanctions against Tokyo.
The coming week will produce a great deal more huffing and puffing from the
two capitals, and this is likely to keep the relationship between the
currencies volatile, with the possibility of further Yen appreciation from
the rate of 104.60 to the dollar reached in late Friday trading.
The Yen's sharp rise stems from the market's expectation that Washington
will 'talk up' the Japanese currency to put negotiating pressure on the
Hosokawa Government. And the mere anticipation of such a move has obviated
the need for overt action by the US, which has sat back and tacitly accepted
the Yen's advance.
This week the Clinton administration is expected to unveil tougher action to
force the Japanese to accept numerical import quotas and reduce their trade
surplus.
In Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan has been intervening heavily to hold back
the Yen's advance, the Government is reported to be drafting voluntary trade
concessions in an attempt to head off the dispute, and it may want to have a
plan ready by next Saturday, when Finance Ministers from the G7 nations meet
in Frankfurt.
The market suspects the Japanese may ask the G7 to intervene to support a
rate of Y110 to the dollar, which officials in Tokyo argue is more
reflective of economic fundamentals.
Certainly, as Ravi Bulchandani of Goldman Sachs points out, the real
effective yen exchange rate is well above any level that the currency has
been able to sustain in the past.
And prolonged continuation of the current rate will hurt the Hosokawa
administration, undermining its economic stimulus package, hitting corporate
profitability and stock prices, and possibly prolonging recession.
US policy-makers face a trade-off between a desire to squeeze genuine trade
concessions out of Japan, and the knowledge that prolonging recession there
is ultimately harmful to US exports and geo-political interests.
Tokyo, for its part, seems to have two central policy options. One is to
give considerable ground to the US on trade issues, while appearing to stand
firm on numerical targets to shore up the Government's weak domestic
political position.
The other is to take pressure off both the yen and the domestic economy by a
further cut in interest rates. Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of
Japan, maintained last week that interest rates were sufficiently low to
support economic activity, but many analysts in Tokyo expect easing action
in the near future. Whatever the policy mix, it should exert downward
pressure on the yen.
Bundesbank action
The dollar should strengthen against European currencies over the next few
months as European interest rates continue to fall and as political
uncertainty mounts in Germany, with the approach of lander and national
elections.
The downward trend of European rates was reconfirmed on Thursday with the
Bundesbank's announcement of a 50 basis point cut in the discount rate,
which may have been delayed a couple of weeks as the bank weighed up the
impact on the D-Mark of the Fed's tightening action.
In the event, the dollar has been sliding against the D-Mark, dragged down
by its yen weakness, and the fall perversely persisted to the end of last
week, despite the Bundesbank's rate cutting action.
However, it may be a week or two before the Bundesbank cuts its most
important instrument, the repo rate, which it left unchanged at 6 per cent.
It could be holding back until it sees further progress in talks to avert
national engineering strikes, better inflation figures, or the March 1
implementation of a cut in commercial banks' minimum reserves.
SG Warburg's international bonds team argues that with inflation likely to
fall from 3.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent by the end of the year, there is a
good chance the discount rate will fall at least 1 per cent further towards
a trough early in 1995 of 4 per cent, with the repo rate about 25 basis
points higher.
Although the Bundesbank's action was widely imitated across Europe on
Thursday, France failed to match the cut.
But the weakness of the French economy means that it will surely follow suit
before long, possibly waiting for the repo rate to drop first.
Bullish on Japan
Could the current strength of the yen be due in small part to foreign
investors, who have been substantially underweight in Japanese stocks,
placing an early bet on economic recovery? A straw in the wind could be the
latest thinking of Morgan Stanley strategist Barton Biggs, who thinks the
pivotal economic event of the year in certain respects 'will not be the
gradual rise in US interest rates, but rather an unexpected and strong
economic recovery in Japan". In Biggs' view, such a revival would be bullish
for the world economy, Japanese stocks, Australia (Japan's natural resource
supplier), oil prices and maybe Malaysia (natural gas, tin, palm oil).
But it could be bearish for Japanese bonds, the yen (as the trade surplus
shrinks), and Hong Kong and other markets where Japanese money has gone. He
cautions that the government's economic stimulus programme and the survival
of the prime minister are in doubt, but 'even depressions and secular bear
markets don't last forever, and stock market bottoms are built from
discouragement and despair'.
