FT  03 AUG 94 / Lunn Poly to start price war
Lunn Poly, the largest travel retailer, is expected today to launch a
price-cutting campaign for summer 1995, reducing the cost of a seven-day
holiday in Ibiza to Pounds 88.
The campaign, which is likely to spark a response from other travel
retailers, will offer 11 per cent reductions on summer 1995 holidays.
It follows the company's announcement yesterday that a record 9m overseas
summer holidays are likely to be sold by travel agents this year, in spite
of the hot weather in the UK.
Travel agents had sold 7.5m summer holidays by the end of June - over 1m
more than by the same time last year. A sales figure of 9m for the summer
would represent a 13 per cent increase on last year and be well above the
previous record of 8m set in 1987.
The increase comes after a warning last week by the English Tourist Board
that the growth of the overseas package holiday market was damaging the UK
tourist industry. Although a record 19.3m overseas tourists visited the UK
last year, the tourism balance of payments deficit was Pounds 3.1bn.
Lunn Poly said overseas holiday sales this year had been stimulated by
price-cutting. The average price of a summer holiday booked through Lunn
Poly by the end of June was Pounds 353 compared with Pounds 356 last year.
Spain remained the most popular destination for UK holidaymakers, increasing
its market share to 44 per cent this year from 37 per cent last year. Greece
was in second place with 16 per cent, down 1 percentage point.
The US share has fallen to 5 per cent from 6 per cent. However, the total
number of Britons buying US holidays had risen to 400,000 by the end of June
from 354,000 last year.
