  [Text] The withdrawal of Libyan troops and administration 
from the Chadian locality of Aozou will begin soon. Chadian and 
Libyan authorities have agreed on the modalities of this final 
withdrawal of Libyan troops in accordance with the ruling of the 
International Court of Justice on 3 February. The draft 
agreement, in our possession, was signed yesterday in Sirte. It 
stipulates that the operations for the withdrawal of the Libyan 
administration and troops from Aozou must start on 15 April 
under the supervision of a joint team comprising 25 Chadian and 
25 Libyan officers. These operations must end on 30 May and will 
be inspected by United Nations observers. The agreement also 
provides for a number of technical details including the 
minesweeping of particularly vulnerable (?areas) in the region, 
the final drawing of the border line between Libya and Chad, and 
the designation of pathways from one country to the other.
