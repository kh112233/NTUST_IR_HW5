  [Text] Nagoya -- Tokai Passenger Japan Railway Co., Ltd. 
(JR Tokai), and Japan Railway Technical Research Institute 
(JRTRI) have jointly embarked on the production of the first 
three-car maglev train vehicles to be tested on the Yamanashi 
Maglev Experimental Line as the next step in the 
commercialization of the maglev railway, with an expected train 
speed of as high as 500 km/h. In the spring of 1995, the vehicle 
construction will be completed, and in the spring of 1996, tests 
will begin in order to gradually increase the train speed. 
  The vehicles under construction were designed to be 
lightweight and compact based on technologies developed on the 
Miyazaki experimental line and through the fusion of airplane 
and railroad-car technologies. The vehicles will be articulated 
cars, and two aerodynamic designs will be tested for the train's 
front shape: the "aero-wedge shape" designed by JRTRI, and the 
"double-cusp shape" designed by JR Tokai. 
  Car bodies will be made of an aluminum alloy. The 
superconducting magnet-carrying bogie car -- the heart of the 
maglev car, which transmits levitative and propulsive forces to 
the vehicle -- is also equipped with supporting and guiding 
wheels, which are necessary when moving at slow speeds. The 
braking device is an energy-saving, power-regenerative brake. In 
addition, there is a multiple brake system consisting of 
coil-shorting brakes and power-generation brakes, as a back-up 
to increase safety. 
  In the spring of 1995, the production of vehicles for the 
second train, consisting of five cars, will begin. In FY96, 
tests will be conducted for two trains passing each other in 
opposing directions, and the final decision for 
commercialization will be made in FY98. 
  Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., and Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries, Ltd., are in charge of manufacturing the 
aero-wedge-shaped and the double-cusp-shaped cars, respectively, 
and Nippon Sharyo Ltd. is building the middle car with only 
passenger seats. The total production outlay is &yen;5.5-5.6 
billion.
