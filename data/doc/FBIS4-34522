  [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- In Sao Jose dos Campos on 14 
June, Sao Paulo Deic [Criminal Investigations Department] police 
arrested lawyer Geraldo Magela Gontijo, who was carrying 
counterfeit dollar bills worth $2.05 million. The bills, found 
in two bags at the lawyer's office, were printed in Ribeirao 
Preto. Police caught the lawyer after arresting print worker 
Ademir Ambrosio in Sao Miguel Paulista (Sao Paulo). Ambrosio 
confessed to the crime and revealed the place where some of the 
bills--of an $8 million order that was being printed--had been 
left. 
  Police were investigating the links between Gontijo and 
Ambrosio, who were interrogated early in the morning. Despite 
being caught red-handed, the lawyer denied the charges and said 
he was not the bills' owner. He is being held at the county 
prison. According to Ambrosio, the counterfeiting began four 
months ago. He was to have received 5 percent of the total. The 
bills, all $100 bills, were not finished.
