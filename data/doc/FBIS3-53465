  [Text] Foreign ministers of the Islamic Conference 
Organization's contact group have asked for practical steps by 
the Islamic countries to solve the Bosnia crisis. At the 
conclusion of the group members' two-day session, held to follow 
up the UN measures to halt the Serbs' crimes, our country's 
Foreign Minister Mr. Velayati explained some points on the 
resolution of this session in a telephone conversation with a 
Central News Unit correspondent in Paris. We draw your 
attention to his remarks. 
  [Begin Velayati recording] There are positive and 
interesting 
points in the resolution of the contact group session. One of 
the points is that the Islamic countries will reconsider their 
economic ties with those countries which have undermined the 
course of liberating Bosnia and regaining the rights of the 
Muslims. It is an unprecedented move in practice that the 
Islamic countries are going to reconsider their economic ties 
with those countries which support the Serbs directly or 
indirectly. Such a decisions was never taken before by any 
international forum, including the Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO]. 
  Another point achieved in one of the resolution's articles 
says that should the United Nations fail to take decisive 
actions or if the decisions of the Security Council and the 
General Assembly are not put into practice, the Muslims, in 
accordance with the 88th resolution of the 48th session of the 
UN General Assembly, will feel free [mojaz] to take joint or 
individual action to help the Bosnian Muslims in various ways. 
Such links between the ICO and the United Nations were never 
established before. That is, we have not had such a legal 
basis, which is acceptable by the international community and at 
the same time gives a free hand to the Muslims to take direct 
action to help the Bosnians. [end recording]
