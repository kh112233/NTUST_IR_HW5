FT  18 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Ukraine already enjoying significant
benefits from new focus of EBRD
Sir, David Marsh's article, 'Excess gives way to restraint' (March 4) echoes
the reaction of many officials and professionals in countries which have
received European Bank for Reconstruction and Development investment to the
changes effected by Mr Jacques de Larosiere since his appointment as
president of EBRD.
Former EBRD president Mr Jacques Attali's reputation as a visionary is well
recognised. However, we felt that, under his leadership, EBRD focused its
attention on investment in Russia to form a base from which to apply
successes to the other former Soviet republics. As a result, countries like
Ukraine received little benefit from EBRD efforts during the past few years.
By contrast, under Mr de Larosiere's direction, Ukraine has seen evidence
that his professional background as a banker, at the Bank of France and
International Monetary Fund, has had its effect both on local leadership and
in outright results. The bank's current focus in Ukraine on supporting local
investment and banking services has resulted in substantial progress and an
actual extension of com-mitments, especially in the area of financial
institu-tions.
Needless to say, we have found the benefits of this change of leadership and
direction within EBRD to have had a significant effect on fulfilling the
original mission of the agency and on its impact on the developing economies
of its target countries.
