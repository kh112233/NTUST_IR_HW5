FT  21 JUL 93 / Press is favoured as TV 'flounders'
TELEVISION is declining in significance and newspapers will continue to have
considerable advantages over the electronic media, a report on the future of
the media by the Henley Centre consultancy group says.
The study, backed by an opinion survey by Research International, found the
attraction of television waning, with 60 per cent of respondents saying that
they would rather go out and do other things and 42 per cent saying most
television programmes were 'dull and predictable'.
A widening income gap is also having a significant impact on the number of
hours people watch, with the poorest watching 11 hours a week more than the
richest, it says.
The Henley Centre suggests a 'cultural underclass' may be developing, with
those on lowest incomes restricted to the relatively cheap entertainment of
television while those on higher incomes can pay for wider leisure choices.
Saturation with television, the study argues, explains the slowdown in
satellite dish sales. It predicts a maximum of 4m to 4.5m dish households by
the end of the century.
It says: 'Satellite programmes are valuable add-ons but are not part of
mainstream British viewing habits and are unlikely to become so.' Cable
television, on the other hand, could prosper because of its capability for
interaction between viewers and the programme providers.
The Henley study argues that in spite of concern about declining newspaper
circulations they are still an integral part of many people's lives.
Research International found that 25 per cent of people talked every day
about what they read in the newspapers compared to 27 per cent who talked
about a television programme.
It says the role of newspapers will change to accommodate the greater
immediacy of radio and television.
