  [Text] The government yesterday reiterated its "firm and 
irrevocable determination to recover, through diplomatic means," 
the Malvinas, Georgias, and Sandwich Islands. The occasion was 
the 165th anniversary of the creation of the Political and 
Military Command of the islands that were occupied by Great 
Britain in 1833. 
  The Foreign Ministry yesterday distributed a communique 
saying that the government reiterates its "willingness to 
continue to explore the possibility of different understandings 
with the United Kingdom to contribute to the consolidation of 
peace and cooperation in the region," referring to the 
negotiation on Malvinas fishing and oil. 
  The document adds: "This attitude is proof of the belief 
that 
we are acting in the best interests of Argentina and the UK, 
seeking to create the appropriate framework for an adequate 
solution to the controversy." 
  In this context, "the Argentine Government's concrete 
actions 
are proof of its willingness to respect the Malvinas Islands 
inhabitants and to promote improved communication and effective 
cooperation between them and other inhabitants of the Argentine 
territory."
