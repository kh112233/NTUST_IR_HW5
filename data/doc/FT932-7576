FT  22 MAY 93 / GM acts against former senior executive
GENERAL MOTORS is asking German authorities to pursue charges against Mr
Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, its former head of worldwide purchasing,
for the alleged removal of company documents.
Mr Lopez moved to Volkswagen of Germany in March as head of production and
purchasing.
At a press conference after GM's annual meeting in Oklahoma City yesterday,
Mr Louis Hughes, executive vice-president for international operations, said
the company had 'executed a legal complaint' against Mr Lopez 'for what we
believe is the taking of confidential documents'.
The complaint was in the hands of German prosecutors, who would decide
whether to pursue the charges, Mr Hughes added.
In Bonn last night, VW declined to comment. An official said there would be
no statement until Monday at the earliest.
Shortly after Mr Lopez's surprise departure, he hired six GM employees -
three purchasing executives and three buyers - who had worked under him. GM
has alleged that Mr Lopez also approached up to 40 more in an effort to lure
them to VW. The US group has already filed a legal action in Germany to stop
alleged headhunting of staff by Mr Lopez.
Mr Lopez's departure from GM was seen as a blow to its efforts to cut car
manufacturing costs in North America, where the company has lost Dollars
12bn (Pounds 7.70bn) over the past two years.
