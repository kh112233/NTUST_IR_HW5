SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 19, 1989 (54 FR 51946), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 9B4172) had been filed by PPG Industries,
Inc., Pittsburgh, PA 15146, proposing that 176.170 

Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods

 (21 CFR 176.170) be amended to provide for the safe use of 

N,N,N
&rsquo;,N
&rsquo;,N
&rsquo;
&rsquo;,N
&rsquo;
&rsquo;

-hexakis(methoxymethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine polymer with stearyl alcohol,

V

-hydroxypoly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), and alkyl (C

20

+) alcohols as a component of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous foods.


In its evaluation of the safety of this additive, FDA has reviewed the safety of the additive itself and the chemical
impurities that may be present in the additive resulting from its manufacturing process. Although the additive itself
has not been shown to cause cancer, it may contain minute amounts of unreacted 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide, carcinogenic
impurities, resulting from the manufacture of the additive. Residual amounts of reactants and manufacturing aids,
such as 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide, are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including food
additives.


I. Determination of Safety


Under Section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called
``general safety clause'' of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation
of the evidence available to FDA establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations
(21 CFR 170.3(i)) define safe as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance
is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.''
The food additives anticancer, or Delaney, clause (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) provides that no food additive
shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney
clause applies to the additive itself and not constituents of the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not
been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general
safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm
will result from the proposed use of the additive,

II. Safety of the Petitioned Use 


FDA estimates that the petitioned use of the additive, 

N,N,N
&rsquo;,N
&rsquo;,N
&rsquo;
&rsquo;,N
&rsquo;
&rsquo;

-hexakis(methoxymethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine polymer with stearyl alcohol, 




-octadecenyl-

V

-hydroxypoly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), and alkyl (C

20

+) alcohols, will result in levels of exposure to the additive of no greater than 19 parts per billion in the daily diet
(Ref. 1).
FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive
whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However,
the agency has reviewed the available toxicological data from acute toxicity studies on the additive. No adverse
effects were reported in these studies.
FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data and
using risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limits of risk presented by the carcinogenic chemicals
that may be present as impurities in the additive, 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide. This risk evaluation of 1,4-dioxane
and ethylene oxide has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the worst-case exposure to the impurities from the proposed
use of the additive, and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable
exposure to humans.


A. 1,4-Dioxane


FDA has estimated the hypothetical worst-case exposure to 1,4-dioxane from the petitioned use of the additive in
the manufacture of paper and paperboard to be 11 nanograms per person per day (ng/person/day) (Ref. 1). The agency
used data from a carcinogenesis bioassay on 1,4-dioxane, conducted for the National Cancer Institute (Ref. 3), to
estimate the upper-bound limits of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming from the proposed
use of the additive (Ref. 3). The results of the bioassay on 1,4-dioxane demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic
for female rats under the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantly increased incidence of
squamous cell carcinomas and hepatocellular tumors in female rats.
Based on a potential exposure of 11 ng/person/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limits of individual lifetime
risk from the potential exposure to 1,4-dioxane from the use of the subject additive is 4x10

-10

, or less than 4 in 10 billion (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservative assumptions used in calculating the exposure
estimate, actual lifetime averaged individual exposure to 1,4-dioxane is likely to be substantially less than the
worst-case exposure, and therefore, the calculated upper-bound limits of risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes
that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to 1,4-dioxane that might result from the proposed
use of the additive.


B. Ethylene Oxide


FDA estimated that the hypothetical worst-case exposure to ethylene oxide from the petitioned use of the additive
in the manufacture of paper and paperboard is 11 ng/person/day (Ref. 1). The agency used data from a carcinogenesis
bioassay on ethylene oxide conducted for the Institute of Hygiene, University of Mainz, Germany, to estimate the
upper-bound level of lifetime human risk from exposure to ethylene oxide stemming from the proposed use of the additive
(Ref. 5). The results of the bioassay on ethylene oxide demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for female
rats under the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantly increased incidence of squamous cell
carcinomas of the forestomach and carcinoma in situ of the glandular stomach.
Based on a potential exposure of 11 ng/person/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limits of individual lifetime
risk from the potential exposure to ethylene oxide from the use of the subject additive is 2x10

-8

, or less than 2 in 100 million (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservative assumptions used in calculating the exposure
estimate, actual lifetime-averaged individual exposure to ethylene oxide is likely to be substantially less than
the worst-case exposure, and therefore, the calculated upper-bound limits of risk would be less. Thus, the agency
concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to ethylene oxide that might result from
the proposed use of the additive.


C. Formaldehyde 


A review of the petition also indicates that the additive may contain formaldehyde as an impurity at a dietary concentration
of 15 micrograms/person/day. The potential carcinogenicity of formaldehyde was reviewed by the Cancer Assessment
Committee (the committee) that has been formed by FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The committee
noted that for many years formaldehyde has been known to be a carcinogen by the inhalation route, but it concluded that
these inhalation studies are not appropriate for assessing the potential carcinogenicity of formaldehyde in food
because of the inappropriate route administration and the fact that tumors were observed only locally at the portal
of entry (nasal turbinates). The agency has received literature reports of two drinking water studies on formaldehyde:
(1) A preliminary report of a carcinogenicity study purported to be positive by Soffritti et al. (1989), conducted
in Bologna, Italy (Ref. 7), and (2) a negative study by Til, et al. (1989), conducted in The Netherlands (Ref. 8). The
committee reviewed both studies and concluded in a ``Memorandum of Conference,'' dated April 24, 1991 and March 4,
1993, ``*** that data concerning the Soffritti study reported were unreliable and could not be used
in the assessment of the oral carcinogenicity of formaldehyde'' (Ref. 6). This conclusion is based on a lack of critical
details in the study, questionable histopathologic conclusions, and the use of unusual nomenclature to describe
the tumors. Thus, the committee concluded that there is no basis to find that formaldehyde is a carcinogen when ingested.


D. Need for Specifications


The agency has also considered whether specifications are necessary to control the amount of 1,4-dioxane and ethylene
oxide in the additive. The agency finds that specifications are not necessary for the following reasons: (1) Because
of the low levels at which 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide may be expected to remain as impurities following production
of the additive, the agency would not expect these impurities to become components of food at other than extremely
low levels; and (2) the upper-bound limits of lifetime risk from exposure to these impurities, even under worst-case
assumptions, is very low, less than 4 in 10 billion and less than 2 in 100 million for 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide,
respectively.


III. Conclusion


FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed uses for the
additive in paper and paperboard products in contact with aqueous food are safe. Based on this information, the agency
has also concluded that the additive will have the intended technical effect. Accordingly, 176.170 is amended
as set forth below.
In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.


IV. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.


V. Objections


Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before October 21, 1994, file with
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
