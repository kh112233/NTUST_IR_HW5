FT  04 MAY 94 / Rail link decision
A decision on the sites of additional stations on the Pounds 2.7bn Channel
tunnel rail link is expected within the next four weeks, Mr John Armitt,
chief executive of Union Railway and designer of the route, said yesterday,
Charles Batchelor writes.
The government will choose between one or more of three sites: Stratford in
east London, Rainham in Essex and Ebbsfleet in Kent, in addition to the
station being built at Ashford in Kent.
Following a decision last week on the route of the last two sections of the
link, this is the final unresolved issue before a detailed brief is issued
to prospective construction consortia in June.
