PHILIPPINE AIRLINES NAMES 4 SUSPECTED TERRORISTS 
Philippine Airlines today identified four people authorities say are members of 
a radical Palestinian faction that has threatened to hijack or blow up an Asian 
airliner this month. 
An airline spokesman said the four -- Mudh Zaman Bakar, Muhen Barani, Mustafa 
Burani and Ahmed Yasar -- are believed to be members of Fatah Uprising, a 
Palestinian faction led by Abu Moussa. 
He said the names, provided by airport authorities in Tokyo, have prompted the 
Manila aiport to carefully screen passengers from South Asia and the Mideast. 
The suspects are believed to be carrying passports from India, Pakistan and 
Oman. 
Last week, Asian aviation officials said they were warned by Air-India of a 
possible attack on an Asian aircraft by Jan. 10.
