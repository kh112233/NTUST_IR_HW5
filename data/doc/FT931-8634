FT  18 FEB 93 / Observer: Home to roost
A fresh challenge to animal trainers has just been thrown down by the Church
of England's general synod - how to house-train bats.
Protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act, they are also favoured by
vicars who mostly like to have them in their rafters, if not belfries. Alas
the welcome they've been given is now coming home to roost, with worshippers
complaining of the fall-out.
The 'unpleasant excretory consequences' are a growing problem, the synod was
informed by Canon Michael Saward of St Paul's Cathedral.
