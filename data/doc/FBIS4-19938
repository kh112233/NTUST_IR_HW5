  [Text] Munich/Duesseldorf (DPA) -- Approximately 3,000 
people demonstrated peacefully against the deportation of Kurds 
and German arms deliveries to Turkey in Munich and Duesseldorf 
on Saturday [23 April]. 
  Approximately 2,000 participants in Munich followed the call 
of the Alliance Against Racism and other organizations. 
Reportedly, two persons were temporarily detained because they 
were armed. Several police squadrons had been employed. 
  Kurdish women and children gathered with flags and posters 
in 
the center of Duesseldorf. On Friday evening, the 
demonstration, which had been registered as a "children's party" 
and had first been prohibited by the Duesseldorf police 
president, was authorized by the local administrative court. As 
a precaution, the police had concentrated several police 
squadrons in the North Rhine-Westphalian capital in order to be 
armed against possible riots.

Offenses 
  In the controversy over the deportation of Kurds, Bavarian 
Minister President Edmund Stoiber has meanwhile affirmed the 
tough line of the Christian Social Union Land Government. 
"Someone who smashes the kneecap of a police officer or 
overturns cars and sets them on fire forfeits the right of 
hospitality and has to be sent home," Stoiber said before the 
Christian-Social Employees (CSA) in Munich on Saturday.
