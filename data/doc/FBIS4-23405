<F P=106> [Communique issued by the General Staff of the Armed Forces </F>
for the Liberation of Angola in Huambo on 5 June] 
  [Text] The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola 
aircraft are still bombing, with a truly murderous fury cities, 
towns and villages, all of them distent from war theaters. Over 
the past two days, 122 napalm, incendiary and fragmentation 
bombs were dropped in peaceful areas such as Huambo, Caala, 
Legua, Camenongue, Cangandala, Cangola, and Capenda Camulemba. 
The victims were all civilians: 103 people were killed and 341 
others wounded on 4 and 5 June. The General Staff once more 
alerts the Angolan and international community to the serious 
consequences of the current escalation of violence for which 
only the government of Eduardo dos Santos is to blame. 
  [Issued] Huambo, 5 June 1994. 
  [Signed] Ben-Ben, chief of General Staff, and army general.
