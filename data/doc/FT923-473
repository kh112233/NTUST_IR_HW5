FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome pays Dollars 24m for rest of
Welgen
BURROUGHS Wellcome, the US subsidiary of Wellcome, yesterday announced it
had acquired the 50 per cent it did not own of Welgen Manufacturing
Partnership, a biotechnology manufacturing joint-venture with GI
Manufacturing of the US.
Wellcome is paying Genetics Institute, GI Manufacturing's parent company,
about Dollars 24m for the stake. Welgen will be incorporated into Burroughs
Wellcome's manufacturing subsidiary.
'Biopharmaceutical products and manufacturing play an important part in our
new product portfolio. This acquisition expands our company's capability to
pursue full clinical and commercial development of products produced through
bio-technology and manufacture them,' said Mr Philip Tracy, president and
chief executive of Burroughs Wellcome.
Welgen manufactures Wellferon, a treatment for hepatitis B and hairy cell
leukaemia at its West Greenwich, Rhode Island plant. The drug, which was
launched in 1986, is also being tested to see if it can alleviate the
condition of patients infected by HIV, the virus that causes Aids. It has
been studied as a treatment for genital warts and juvenile laryngeal
papillomatosis.
Wellcome expects to set up production of Campath-1H, a cancer treatment, at
the site. The drug is in phase one and two trials for the treatment of
Hodgkins lymphomas and rheumatoid arthritis.
