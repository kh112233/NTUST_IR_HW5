ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ROTH LIKELY TO CHAIR TRAIN COMMISSION 
County Supervisor Don R. Roth is expected today to be elected chairman of a 
commission that is guiding the creation of a super-speed train linking Anaheim 
with Las Vegas. 
Roth currently is vice chairman of the California-Nevada Super Speed Train 
Commission, which has approved an international consortium's plans to privately 
build and operate a 265-m.p.h. magnetic levitation train. 
The rail service, which could begin in 1997, will link Anaheim with Las Vegas 
in a 75-minute, one-way trip. 
Roth has said that the $5-billion train will "thrust both states into the 21st 
Century," reducing traffic congestion and attracting tourists. 
Roth also supports the project because he has been pushing for construction of 
a regional airport at George Air Force Base in San Bernardino County, which 
would be considered too remote without high-speed rail service. 
The 16 members of the commission will vote on the chairmanship, which changes 
annually, this afternoon at the Balboa Bay Club in Newport Beach. The current 
chairman is Arnie Adamsen, a Las Vegas city councilman. MARLA CONE
