POINDEXTER SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR ROLE IN IRAN-CONTRA SCANDAL 
Once again, we see that individuals accused and convicted of "white-collar 
crimes" are treated differently from those individuals charged with other 
criminal offenses. If you look at the consequences of the conduct of Poindexter 
and the other "convicts" of the Iran-Contra affair, you see the following: 
People were killed as a result of their participation in the military conduct 
on behalf of the Contras; people were killed by those who were acting on behalf 
of the Contras; Poindexter and others actually conspired to violate the Boland 
Amendment which prohibited aid to the Contras; and Poindexter covered up all of 
these atrocities and lied to Congress. 
Did you notice his sigh of relief when he was sentenced to only six months in 
custody? Of course, he was allowed to remain free on bail pending his appeals. 
The bottom line is there is a different -- preferential if you will -- 
treatment for white-collar criminals that is inherent in our criminal justice 
system. 
A two-time offender of petty theft who lived in Compton would not be walking 
the streets. Where is the equal protection under the law?
