THE SIDELINES; 
DRAKE FLUNKS AS EX-PLAYER SUES 
Former basketball player Terrell Jackson has sued Drake University for fraud, 
alleging the school reneged on a promise to provide him an education. 
Jackson was recruited by former Coach Tom Abatemarco in 1988 after attending 
several schools, including Minnesota and Cincinnati. 
He quit the team this winter in a dispute that led to the resignation of 
Abatemarco, now an assistant at Colorado. 
Jackson, 22, seeks punitive and compensatory damages in a suit filed in Polk 
County District Court that also accuses Drake of breach of contract, negligent 
misrepresentation and violation of Jackson's civil rights. 
The lawsuit alleged Drake lured Jackson with promises of academic support to 
complete his degree, then made it virtually impossible to receive an education. 
The suit alleged the school, through Abatemarco and his staff, asked Jackson to 
plagiarize term papers, urged him "to register for classes that detracted or 
conflicted least from the basketball schedule and would provide high grades 
essential to maintaining academic eligibility regardless of their academic 
worth."
