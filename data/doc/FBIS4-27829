  [Text] Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
today sent the high altitude strategic reconnaissance plane U-2 
deep into the sky above the territorial waters of our side in 
the East Sea to conduct aerial espionage on the Northern half of 
Korea. 
  The plane infiltrated deep into the sky above the 
territorial 
waters of our side off Tongchon on two occasions at about 12 
hours 49 minutes and 13 hours 22 minutes and conducted 
photographing and electronic espionage on the whole area and 
coastal area of the Northern half of Korea. 
  This is a deliberate and premeditated espionage of the U.S. 
imperialists in advance to invade the Northern half of Korea. 
  We cannot overlook the U.S. imperialists and their followers 
further undisguised in aerial espionage against the North, 
talking about "sanction" and "military strength" over the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  The U.S. imperialists must clearly see a grave consequence 
of the worsening situation in the Korean peninsula and act with 
discretion.
