  [Text] Jordan will implement significant steps against 
Hamas members on its territory only if Hamas carries out another 
murderous attack in Israel. 
  This has transpired at the end of the talks between Israel 
and Jordan. During the talks, Israel demanded that King Husayn 
immediately put a halt to Hamas activity in Jordan. The 
Jordanian representatives, however, claimed that if they carry 
out the desired steps in the next few days, this would be 
construed as Israeli and U.S. intervention in Jordanian affairs. 
Consequently, they announced that such steps will be 
implemented only once there is sufficient cause -- for example, 
after another attack is carried out in Israel. 
  Israeli sources said that Israel had no choice but to accept 
the Jordanian condition. At the same time, Israel was told that 
Jordan will gradually implement more long-term steps against 
Hamas.
