BRIEFLY 
Fugitive Still Being Paid Agricultural Subsidy: A company owned by fugitive 
Marc Rich from U.S. justice has received more than $65 million in payments from 
the U.S. Agriculture Department and continues to benefit from American farm 
export subsidies, a congressman charged. Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) said Rich, 
owner of Richco Grain Ltd., is under criminal indictment but his firm continues 
to receive payments from the department to underwrite grain exports. Richco 
Grain is based in Zug, Switzerland, but has an office in Stamford, Conn. The 
Kansas Democrat said Rich faced a 65-count indictment on "a litany of criminal 
charges, ranging from tax evasion to fraud to dealing with the enemy." Rich now 
lives in Zug.
