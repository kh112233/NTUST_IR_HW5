FT  25 AUG 94 / North Sea platforms to use wind turbines
Wind turbines have been chosen to provide electricity on two natural gas
platforms in the North Sea, in what is believed to be the first such
application of alternative energy sources.
Amoco, the US oil company, is spending Pounds 200,000 to install
wind-powered generators for equipment on its unmanned Davy and Bessemer
platforms off the East Anglian coast. The bigger, manned platforms are
unsuitable candidates because of their large power requirements, which can
be the equivalent of a town of 30,000 people.
The company expects to reap financial and environmental benefits. It
forecasts an 85 per cent reduction in spending on diesel, the fuel normally
used to power generators on unmanned platforms, and a 75 per cent cut in
hydrocarbon exhausts.
It will be able to reduce the frequency of visits to the platforms by
maintenance staff. Helicopter trips will be cut from an average of once a
fortnight to once every 90 days.
Use of wind turbines is in line with industry efforts to cut the operating
costs of offshore installations.
