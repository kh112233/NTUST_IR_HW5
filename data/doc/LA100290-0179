3 DIE IN LATEST ROUND OF CASTE STRIFE IN INDIA 
At least three people were killed and 10 wounded today when police opened fire 
on demonstrators protesting the Indian government's plan to increase the number 
of its jobs reserved for low-caste Hindus. 
Two of the dead were demonstrators and one was a police officer who died in the 
hospital after "hooligans fired on the police," a police spokesman said. 
Senior Policeman Ajay Chadha said his men were forced to open fire after 
running out of tear gas when about 80 of them were surrounded near Parliament 
by a 5,000-strong mob wielding heavy sticks and throwing stones. 
"The crowd became totally unmanageable and we had to open fire," he said after 
a rally that took place on the birthday of the late Mohandas K. Gandhi, the 
advocate of nonviolence who led India to independence in 1947. 
Serious unrest began as people drifted away from the rally against Prime 
Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh's plan to increase government jobs reserved 
for lower castes, outcastes and tribal people from 22.5% to nearly half. 
Also today, officials said a paramilitary patrol responded to a grenade attack 
in Kashmir by burning 400 houses and firing on villagers, killing at least 17 
people and leaving hundreds missing. 
Many victims were dragged from their homes and shot at close range, and others 
died in the fire that gutted the densely populated market area, witnesses said. 
The incident occurred Monday in Handwara, an apple-trading town 50 miles from 
the northern Jammu-Kashmir state capital, Srinagar. 
Phansung, a town official who uses one name, said seven of the dead were buried 
today. Other officials said the smoldering debris of the buildings had not been 
searched, and the death toll was expected to rise. 
The government said the fire started after Muslim militants hurled a grenade at 
Border Security Force troops patrolling the town market.
