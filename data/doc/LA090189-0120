BRIEFLY 
Inside Trader Gets 5 Years: A corporate merger lawyer convicted of fraud, 
racketeering and tax evasion was sentenced to five years in prison in what a 
prosecutor said was the longest jail term ever imposed in an insider trading 
case. "You are a brilliant, talented man who could have accomplished anything 
you wanted to in the practice of law, but there is a dark side to that talent," 
U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen said in sentencing Alfred Elliott. The judge 
also fined Elliott $332,000 and ordered the forfeiture under federal 
racketeering statutes of more than $350,000 in profits resulting from illegal 
stock trades.
