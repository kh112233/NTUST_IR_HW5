  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
Thursday [12 May] outlined an interim report on Japan's nuclear 
power policy that proposes review of its longstanding policy of 
encouraging plutonium use, a Trade Ministry official said. 
  The report drafted by a subpanel of the Advisory Committee 
for Energy calls for delaying construction of a second plant to 
reprocess spent nuclear fuel to reproduce plutonium. 
  Japan will decide on a schedule for construction around 
2010, 
according to the report to be presented to the International 
Trade and Industry Minister June 10. 
  The second plant was originally scheduled to begin 
operations 
around 2010. 
  The review reflects global concern over nuclear 
proliferation 
in Japan and the recent setback in nuclear recycling projects in 
Europe, the official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry said. 
  The official said the report proposes limiting Japan's 
nuclear recycling to a nuclear power plant in Rokkasho, Aomori 
Prefecture, and its attached facilities until the second 
reprocessing plant is completed. 
  The report describes the postponement as a temporary setback 
in the nation's policy of promoting plutonium use, citing the 
heavy dependence on nuclear energy. 
  The subpanel report proposes reserving excessive plutonium 
produced at the Rokkasho plant for future use.
