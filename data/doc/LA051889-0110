THE WORLD 
Police in Rio de Janeiro arrested five men and recovered millions of dollars 
worth of art stolen earlier this month, including works by Salvador Dali and 
Henri Matisse, a Brazilian police officer said. Alvaro Luis Souza, who 
commanded a raid leading to the arrests, said that police, responding to a 
phone tip, staked out an apartment in Rio's Botafogo neighborhood and 
apprehended a man as he was leaving. The stolen goods were discovered, 
undamaged, inside the apartment. Souza said four other men were arrested hours 
later. Police still are searching for three more men they believe were involved 
in the May 3 robbery of the Chacara do Ceu Museum, Souza added. Police 
recovered all the stolen art except two Chinese ceramic sculptures from the 7th 
Century and a collection of silverware.
