Criteria for including species in the approved list for non-captive-bred species. 


Upon receipt of a completed sustainable use management plan for a country of export, the Director may approve a species
listed in Appendices II or III of the Convention for importation from that country. Such approval shall be granted
in accordance with the issuance criteria of this section. All approved species and countries of export will be listed
in section 15.33. 
(a) Requirements for scientifically-based sustainable use management plans. Sustainable use management plans
developed by the country of export shall include the following information, and any other information that may be
appropriate: 
(1) Background information, including the following: 
(i) The scientific and common name of the species; 
(ii) Letters from the country of export's Management and Scientific Authorities transmitting the management plan
of this species; 
(iii) A summary of the country of export's legislation related to this species and legislation implementing the Convention,
and, where appropriate, a summary of implementing regulations; 
(iv) A summary, from the country of export's Management Authority, of the country's infrastructure and law enforcement
and monitoring mechanisms designed to ensure both enforcement of and compliance with the requirements of the management
plan, and that the number of birds removed from the wild or exported will be consistent with the management plan; 
(v) Recent information on the distribution of the species within the country of export, including scientific references
and maps, and historical information on distributions, if relevant; and 
(vi) The species' status and its current population trend in the country of export, including scientific references.

(2) Habitat information, including: 
(i) A general description of habitats used by the species for each portion of the life cycle completed within the country
of export; 
(ii) Recent information on the size and distribution of these habitats throughout the country of export and in each
area or region of take, including scientific references and maps. The approximate location of any reserves that provide
protection for this species should be indicated on the accompanying map(s); 
(iii) Status and trends of the important habitats used by the species in the country of export as a whole and within each
area or region of take, whenever available, including scientific references; 
(iv) Factors, including management activities, favoring or threatening the species' habitat in the foreseeable
future throughout the country of export and within each area or region of take, whenever available, including scientific
references; and 
(v) A list of management plans that have been or are being planned, developed, or implemented for the species' important
habitats, if any. 
(3) Information on the role of the species in its ecosystem, including: 
(i) A description of the part(s) of the species' life cycle completed within the country of export; 
(ii) For a species that breeds in the country of export, a description of nest sites and/or plant communities that are
most frequently used for placement of nests and, if applicable, nesting habits; 
(iii) A general description of the species' diet, where the species forages (aerial feeder, tree canopy, tree trunk,
midstory, understory, open water or other), and seasonal changes in foraging habits, including, when available,
scientific references; and 
(iv) Information on any species or plant community which is dependent on the occurrence of the exotic bird species.

(4) Population dynamics of the species, including: 
(i) Recent population data of the population of the species in the country of export, as derived from indices of relative
abundance or population estimates, along with documentation for each estimate; 
(ii) Within each area or region of take, documentation for recent population data or estimates, conducted for at least
three separate years or one year with a description of survey plans for future years. These population assessments
should have been conducted during the same season (breeding or non-breeding) of each year for which documentation
is submitted; 
(iii) If a species belongs to the avian families Columbidae, Fringillidae, Ploceidae, Estrildidae, Sturnidae,
Tinamidae, Podicepedidae, Burhinidae, Scolopacidae, Tyrannidae, Pittidae, Emberizidae, Zosteropidae, Vireonidae,
Atrichornithidae, Sylviidae, Oriolidae, Meliphagidae, or Icteridae, the management plan shall include the following
information: 
(A) For a species that does not breed in the country of export, documentation or a letter from the Convention Scientific
Authority that the species occurs in the country of export only during the nonbreeding season; and
(B) For a species that breeds in the country of export, estimation (with documentation) of recent reproductive success.
Where apppropriate, this assessment could include number of young produced per egg-laying female per year, or pre-breeding
and post-breeding surveys conducted within the same annual cycle; and
(C) Estimation (with documentation) of annual mortality or loss including natural mortality and take for subsistence
use, export trade, and domestic trade in each area of take; or
(D) In lieu of paragraphs (a)(4)(iii) (A) and (C) of this section, documentation of long-term population and offtake
trends based on indices of relative abundance, and measures of offtake and description of any long-term changes in
other mortality factors (including subsistence use, domestic trade, and capture or transport mortalities).
(iv) If a species belongs to an avian family other than those listed in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, the management
plan shall include the following information:
