FT  20 MAY 94 / Go-ahead for Chunnel freight terminal
The Department of the Environment has given planning permission for the
development of a Channel tunnel freight terminal, manufacturing and
distribution park at Hams Hall, east of Birmingham, in the green belt of
north Warwickshire, Paul Cheeseright writes.
The site is near Junction 9 of the M6 and the proposed junction of the
planned toll motorway around north Birmingham with the M6. The government
delayed approval until it was satisfied about the traffic impact on local
roads.
Trafalgar House, the shipping, property and construction group, is a partner
in the development of both the freight terminal and the new motorway.
