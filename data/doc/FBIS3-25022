  [Text] In a vain attempt to take Cuito, Jonas Savimbi's 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] 
continues to mercilessly shell civilians. Late this afternoon, 
our team counted more than 30 killed and 49 wounded, mostly 
children, elderly men, and women, always the most vulnerable 
layers of society. Despite (?heavy) clashes, government troops 
have been scoring major victories against the enemy. By 
yesterday, UNITA positions had been retaken by the Angolan Armed 
Forces [FAA), the National Police, and the Civil Defense. 
Government forces, who have sworn to avenge the death of their 
commander, the ill-fated Lieutenant General Alfredo Kussumue, 
and to flush out the bandits in the service of Jonas Savimbi, 
are determined to fight to the last man. 
  In operations carried out today, government forces captured 
an Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] lieutenant 
and assorted war materiel. As we file this report, UNITA rebel 
forces are using 106-mm guns, B-12, and 130-mm guns, as well as 
60-mm and 81-mm mortars to decimate Cuito residents and reduce 
the city to ashes.
