  [Text] One hundred and seventy people were killed on Friday 
[10 June] by government forces and militias in Kigali. The 
victims were taken from a church at Nyamirambo where over 190 
had taken refuge. Government troops and militias attacked the 
church with machine guns and grenades. The 170 people were 
mainly Tutsis who were forced into trucks and taken for 
slaughter. 
  The continued killing of innocent civilians by government 
forces is an indication of the refusal by the government to 
accept conditions given by the Rwandan Patriotic Front for 
cease-fire negotiations.
