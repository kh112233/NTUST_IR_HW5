FT  07 FEB 92 / Channel Tunnel sleepers order awarded to GEC Alsthom
THE long-delayed order for Channel tunnel sleeper trains is to be awarded to
GEC Alsthom, British Rail said yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes.
The decision about the contract - thought to be worth Pounds 115m - clears
the way for night trains to start running from Britain's regions to Paris
and Brussels from late in 1994.
There will also be two Continental sleeper services from London each night.
One will go to Amsterdam and the other to Cologne, dividing into portions
for Dortmund and Frankfurt.
GEC Alsthom, which is also building all the daytime Channel tunnel
expresses, is believed to have won the contract against bids from Brel, the
troubled British trainmaker, and Keller Meccanica of Italy.
All 139 Channel tunnel sleeping cars are to be built at GEC Alsthom's
Metro-Cammell plant in Washwood Heath, east Birmingham.
The night trains were intended to be ready for the tunnel's planned opening
in June next year, but the order was delayed by the complexity of reaching
agreement between the national railways of Britain, France, Belgium, Germany
and the Netherlands.
Several more weeks are likely to pass before the contract is placed as the
leasing deal expected to finance it has yet to be arranged.
The premature announcement of the contract may give rise to suspicions that
it is intended to mollify the regions in the run-up to the general election.
Three daily sleeper trains will run from the regions. One will set off from
Glasgow, Carlisle, Preston and Crewe, with portions for Paris and Brussels;
a second will go from Swansea, Cardiff, Newport and Bristol to Paris; and a
third will go from Plymouth, Newton Abbott, Exeter, Taunton and Bristol to
Brussels.
