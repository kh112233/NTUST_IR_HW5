FT  17 JUN 93 / US seeks action for world growth
THE US was pursuing a policy of 'export activism' in an attempt to open
markets and stimulate global growth, but was still hoping for bolder
expansionary measures in other leading economies, a senior Clinton
administration official indicated yesterday.
Mr Lawrence Summers, under-secretary for international affairs at the US
Treasury, said that in pressing for the elimination of trade barriers the US
was 'unmanaging trade' rather than managing it. The US was not trying to
expand the role of government but to achieve an outcome that free markets
would have provided in the absence of artificial barriers.
In a speech at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, Mr Summers
called on Japan to curb its trade surplus by stimulating domestic demand and
for European countries to lower interest rates.
Action by the US's trading partners was essential because the US was cutting
its budget deficit and was not able to pull the rest of the world out of
recession as it had in the 1980s.
He said the obstacles to global growth were mainly political as there was a
consensus among economists about policies required in Europe and Japan.
A successful completion of the Uruguay Round trade talks was the
administration's highest priority in trade policy. However, bilateral
pressure to reduce Japan's 'seemingly chronic and growing' surplus was also
necessary.
Mr Summers said Russia had made 'real progress' on economic reforms.
He urged multilateral institutions to speed up transfers of funds to Russia,
saying this was 'not a matter of weakening conditionality but of providing
support at a critical time'.
He said profound cultural changes were necessary at the World Bank and other
development institutions which had put too much emphasis on making loans and
not enough on supervising projects.
