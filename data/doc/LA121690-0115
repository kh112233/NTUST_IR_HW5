HEMLOCK 
To correct an error in the letter regarding euthanasia (Dec. 2), it was of 
course not Plato who drank the hemlock but Socrates. 
He was not "executed for crimes against Athens," but drank the hemlock 
voluntarily as a final gesture of honor for having offended the city by 
speaking the truth, as he saw it, concerning the gods. 
The Hemlock Society also attempts to tell the truth as it sees it, which is 
that it is inhumane cruelty to prolong the degradation, pain and agony of 
terminally ill people who beg for release from intolerable suffering. No 
compassionate person would let a dog or any other animal without hope of 
recovery needlessly suffer a slow, agonizing inevitable death. Yet this is 
precisely what is done to humans who have not had the foresight to prepare a 
living will and a durable power of attorney for health care while they are 
still of sound mind and body.
