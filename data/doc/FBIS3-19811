  [Text] Berlin -- In view of the Kurdish riots in the past 
few days, Friedrich Bohl (Christian Democratic Union), chief of 
the Federal Chancellery, has called for the swift deportation of 
Kurdish offenders. In an interview with SAT 1 this morning, 
Bohl stated that the Federal Government has made efforts to 
intervene in the Turkish-Kurdish conflict within the framework 
of what is possible. However, Germany cannot accept "violent 
actions on German soil to settle the inner-Turkish conflict at 
the expense of German citizens." Bohl stressed: "We must adopt 
tough measures to prevent that." 
  The deportation of Kurdish offenders is possible because 
they 
are not facing persecution "in all parts of Turkey." Bohl 
expressed the hope that the majority of the Kurds living in 
Germany ensures that the reputation of the Kurds in Germany is 
not damaged.
