  [Text] Beijing, March 25 (AFP) -- Zhai Weimin, leader of 
the pro-democracy movement crushed at Tiananmen Square in June 
1989, has been in jail in central China's Henan province since 
his March 6 arrest, his family said Friday. They said he was 
being held at Yeshugou jail, near the city of Xinan in the 
western part of Henan province. 
  The arrest of the 23-year-old dissident came as part of a 
vast security offensive against dissidents in China beginning 
early this month. At least 18 people were picked up. 
  Speaking by telephone on Wednesday, Xinan police said they 
"knew" Zhai but "did not know" where he was. 
  A family member said the dissident was allowed to see his 
youngest sister, Zhai Yujie, on Friday morning, but that the 
police would not divulge the reasons for his arrest. Those 
close to Zhai, however, suspect he will be held at least until 
June 4, the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. 
  Zhai, number six on the "list of most-wanted students" after 
the pro-democracy movement was smashed, was arrested in early 
1990 and spent three-and-a-half years in prison for 
"counter-revolutionary propaganda" before being freed last 
September 13. His release came just a few days before the 
selection of a site for the 2000 summer games. The Chinese 
capital lost out to Sydney, Australia. 
  Three recent arrests of dissident lawyers Zhou Guoqiang, 
Yuan 
Hongbing and Wang Jiaqi have been confirmed by the authorities 
recently. Friends of Yuan and Wang said this week that they had 
been unable to receive any word on them despite repeated appeals 
to judicial authorities.
