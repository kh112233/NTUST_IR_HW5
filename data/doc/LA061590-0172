POLICE TELL WHY THEY SUSPECT TEEN BROTHER SHOT HIS SISTER 
A 12-year-old Anaheim Shores girl who was allegedly shot in the head Thursday 
by her 14-year-old brother remained in critical condition today as police 
revealed details claiming that the boy concocted a story about the shooting. 
Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said 18 police officers searched the neighborhood for about 
an hour Thursday afternoon when the boy telephoned police to report that "three 
masked men" had broken into their home and shot his sister, Gema Marie Hubler, 
in the head. 
Police finally arrested the boy when evidence led them to believe that he had 
concocted the story and that he was responsible for the shooting. 
During the search, Hedgpeth said a police helicopter circled above the 
neighborhood looking for a getaway car and police dogs attempted to track the 
alleged assailants, Hedgpeth said. 
One man was briefly detained during the search after a neighbor reported that 
she saw a "man acting strangely." 
"Even though we felt uncomfortable with his story, we knew that if the 
'suspects' got away because we ignored him, we would have felt bad," Hedgpeth 
said. 
Within an hour, Hedgpeth said investigators suspected that the boy's story was 
concocted. Hedgpeth said the physical evidence police found on the scene did 
not match the boy's story. He declined to elaborate. 
Gema Hubler was in critical condition today at UCI Medical Center in Orange 
where she underwent surgery for a single gunshot wound in the head, police 
said. 
Hubler's brother is being held in Orange County Juvenile Hall on suspicion of 
attempted murder. His name was not released because he is a juvenile.
