U.S., BRITAIN PROPOSE STRICTER AIRPORT SECURITY 
Britain and the United States pressed other nations Wednesday to be more 
vigilant in screening passengers and baggage after the bombing of a Pan Am jet 
over Scotland last December. 
The proposals for tighter security were received favorably by most members of 
the 33-nation council of the International Civil Aviation Organization before 
it began a two-day conference here on safety, officials from both Britain and 
the United States said. 
Britain and the United States requested the meeting of members of the U.N. 
group after the Dec. 21 air disaster when a bomb ripped apart a Pan Am jetliner 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground.
