MORNING REPORT: ART 
Van Gogh Theft: Thieves smashed a museum window in Den Bosch, the Netherlands, 
on Thursday and made off with three Vincent van Gogh paintings worth up to $5.4 
million. The museum's alarm system, described as fail-safe, did not go off. 
The thieves jumped fences and broke the ground-floor window of the gallery 
where the paintings were hanging, officials said. Stolen were "The Sitting 
Farmer's Wife," "The Digging Farmer's Wife" and "Wheels of the Water Mill in 
Gennep." Van Gogh painted them while living in what is now the town of Nuenen, 
18 miles from the museum.It was the third time in 18 months that paintings by 
the Dutch impressionist had been stolen from museums in the Netherlands. GREG
