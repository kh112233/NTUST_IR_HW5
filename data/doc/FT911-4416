FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Pfizer advances to Dollars 267m
on sales surge
PFIZER, the US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday reported a 17 per cent
improvement in first-quarter net income on a 20 per cent rise in sales,
after stripping out discontinued operations from the 1990 results.
Including extraordinary items, Pfizer's net income in the first three months
of 1991 rose 6 per cent to Dollars 267.4m, or 79 cents a share, from Dollars
251.9m, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Earnings per share have been restated
to reflect a two-for-one stock split in January.
In the 1990 quarter, the sale of the DeKalb Pfizer Genetics seed business
contributed Dollars 39m in pre-tax income.
Sales in the quarter rose 14 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars 1.48bn,
led by growth in Pfizer's health care operations. During the quarter, Pfizer
spent Dollars 172.6m on research and development, up 28 per cent from the
first three months of 1990.
Sales from Pfizer's health care business climbed 22 per cent in the 1991
quarter, and sales from Pfizer's animal health operations rose 11 per cent.
However, consumer product sales rose a more modest 8 per cent, and
underlying sales from specialty chemicals and minerals improved by only 1
per cent.
Although there are still worries about litigation over Pfizer's Shiley heart
valve, analysts are bullish about its new product portfolio, which includes
the cardiovascular drug, Procardia XL, and Diflucan for AIDS-related fungal
infections.
Mr Edmund Pratt, chairman and chief executive, said Procardia XL and
Diflucan contributed Dollars 260m in sales in the quarter and Norvasc and
Cardura, two new cardiovascular drugs, Dollars 36m.
Schering-Plough, THe New Jersey-based pharmaceuticals and health care
products group, lifted first-quarter earnings to Dollars 173.2m, or 79 cents
a share, from Dollars 150.4m, 66 cents a share, a year earlier, writes
Bernard Simon in New York.
Sales rose to Dollars 949.3m from Dollars 865.1m, despite the sale last July
of the Maybelline cosmetics business.
Mr Robert Luciano, chairman, predicted that earnings per share would climb
by between 18 and 20 per cent for 1991.
The company attributed the growth in US pharmaceutical sales to solid demand
for its anti-cancer, anti-infective and respiratory products.
