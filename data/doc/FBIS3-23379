  [Text] Cairo, 21 Mar (MENA) -- A responsible security 
source at the Ministry of Interior has stated that the six 
terrorists killed in a shack in the Abu Tij area today took part 
in the shooting against a tourist train in Abu Tij, as well as 
the assassination of the chief of the Baqur police station. 
  The security source noted that acting on information that 
these elements were taking shelter in a shack located between 
(al- Balayzah) cemetery and the western mountain of Asyut, 
security troops from the Asyut Security Directorate, State 
Security Intelligence, and antiterrorist squads stormed their 
hideout. The troops came under heavy fire from these elements 
and returned fire. Private Ahmad Mabruk of the Central Security 
Forces was martyred and six terrorists were killed as a result. 
  The source pointed out that four automatic rifles were found 
inside the shack. The terrorists used them to fire at the 
troops. Two of the rifles had been stolen from Sergeant 'Antar 
Madani and conscript Hamad Mahmud Fath-al-Bab from the Baqur 
police station, after they were assassinated. A locally made 
gun, a large quantity of 6.62 and 9.39-mm bullets, a sack full 
of gunpowder and explosives, and a large quantity of 
organization documents were found. 
  The source stressed that police forces are intensifying 
their 
efforts to pursue and arrest the terrorist elements.
