FT  04 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): 'Nose on a chip' very hot item
Scientists at IBM in Zurich have developed an electronic 'nose on a chip'
which can accurately measure the minute quantities of heat produced by
chemical reactions.
The device, called a calorimeter, can measure temperature changes as small
as a hundred-thousandth of a degree. By measuring the heat produced the
instrument sniffs out what chemicals are involved in a reaction, making it
potentially useful in drug design and forensic science.
The instrument comprises a micromechanical silicon lever coated with
aluminium.
When heated the lever bends because the two materials expand at different
speeds. The degree of bending is measured by laser. IBM: Switzerland, 1 724
