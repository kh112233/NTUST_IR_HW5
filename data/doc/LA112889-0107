FRIENDS MARK BIRTHDAY OF BRITISH HOSTAGE 
Friends of British journalist John McCarthy, who is held hostage in Lebanon, 
marked his 33rd birthday Monday with a demonstration at the Foreign Office, 
demanding it do more for his release. 
McCarthy, a Worldwide Television News cameraman, was kidnaped April 17, 1986, 
as he drove to Beirut airport to fly home after 32 days in Lebanon. No group 
has claimed responsibility for his abduction.
