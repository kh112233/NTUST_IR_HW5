FT  11 MAY 91 / Channel tunnel companies face trial over safety
FIVE member companies of TML, the Channel tunnel consortium, were committed
for trial yesterday charged with failing to ensure the safety of employees.
Balfour Beatty Construction, Costain Civil Engineering, Tarmac Construction,
Taylor Woodrow Construction and Wimpey Major Projects are accused by the
Health and Safety Executive that between December 12 1989 and January 10
1990 they failed to ensure the safety of employees concerning the movement
of trains.
The charge follows the death in January last year of Mr Keith Lynch, a
grouter from Nottingham, who was hit by wagons pushed by a locomotive in an
underground accident at the Shakespeare Cliff site near Dover.
The committal to Kent Crown Court followed a day-long hearing at Dover.
Reporting restrictions were not lifted.
