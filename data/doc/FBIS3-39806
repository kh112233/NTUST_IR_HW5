  [Text] Geneva, Feb 18 (AFP) -- The International Committee 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) stepped up its campaign to have blinding 
laser weapons banned by international convention. 
  ICRC legal adviser Louise Doswald-Beck told a press 
conference that "civilisation would take a step backwards if it 
tolerated such weapons," which could blind a person irreversibly 
at a distance of one kilometre (1,000 yards). 
  In presenting the 300-page report, [written] by experts 
engaged by the ICRC since 1991, Beck said "the laser weapon is 
silent, its ray is invisible and its effect is instantaneous." 
  The ICRC wants the weapon banned when the 1980 Geneva 
Convention is reviewed at the end of this year. 
  Doswald-Beck said individual shoulder-fired laser weapons 
costing just $100 were already being tested in the United States 
and could go into production next year. 
  The British specialist magazine JANE'S DEFENCE WEEKLY 
revealed in 1990 that laser weapons were used by the Royal Navy 
against Argentine pilots during the 1982 Falkland War and could 
have caused the unexplained crash of three aircraft. 
  The ICRC also wants much tighter control on the use of 
anti-personnel mines which tend to kill more civilians than 
combatants.
