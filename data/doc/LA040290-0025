Man Killed in Nelson Bus Crash: A motorist was killed Sunday when his car 
slammed head-on into a bus carrying singer Willie Nelson on a tour of eastern 
Canada, police said. The dead motorist was identified as Paul Leonard Burtch, 
20, of Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia. 
Nelson and four others aboard the bus were unhurt in the crash, which forced 
the bus into a ditch. Burtch's car crossed the center line of Route 104 and hit 
Nelson's bus head-on about 3:30 a.m. near the town of Riversdale in Nova 
Scotia, Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. It was the second accident within 
the past month involving a performer on a tour bus. Singer Gloria Estefan 
suffered a broken back when her bus was hit by a truck in Pennsylvania on March 
24. CLAUDIA PUIG and GREG BRAXTON
