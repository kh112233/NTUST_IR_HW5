FT  03 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Worries over ICI's anti-cancer drug
Concern is growing over the potential dangers of Nolvadex, ICI's main
anti-cancer drug, after the Medical Research Council's decision to study
more information before approving funds for a clinical trial.
The New Scientist said that the MRC delayed approval after receiving new
information about the drug's toxic effects on rats. Nolvadex is a
well-established drug, generating sales of Pounds 240m last year for ICI.
The trial, which would involve 15,000 women, is aimed at discovering whether
Nolvadex - used to treat breast cancer since the 1970s - could be used as a
preventative measure on healthy people.
The article was underscored by a report quoting the University of Texas's
Galveston medical school. The report said Nolvadex might cause liver cell
damage.
Researchers said they found a proliferation of liver cell mutations in
laboratory rats after three days of injections with the drug.
Mr Richard Henderson, a chemicals analyst with Nomura Research, said: 'It is
quite clear from existing literature that the effect on laboratory rats is
radically different from that on people. However, the behaviour of the MRC
suggests that there is something new out there and maybe it is in the
Galveston story.'
