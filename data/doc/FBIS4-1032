  [Text] A Zululand yachtsman may have been killed in 
connection with alleged "third force" operation to supply 
weapons to the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], SOWETAN's sister 
paper, the SUNDAY TRIBUNE, reported yesterday. 
  Colin Lawrence a Zululand yachtsman killed in a "robbery" in 
Maputo, Mozambique, last week, may have been executed by 
elements within the South African security establishment because 
he knew too much about third force weapons smuggling between 
Natal and Mozambique. Security forces told the TRIBUNE last 
week that Lawrence (45) was a former special forces operator. 
An investigation by the paper alleges he was also recently 
involved in ivory and weapon smuggling. 
  A former Military Intelligence [MI] operative told the 
TRIBUNE that "you should look into the death of Lawrence. 
You'll find it's just like Eugene Riley." Riley was a former 
member of the notorious CCB [Civil Cooperation Bureau] and MI 
and was a member of the secret Badger unit. He died 
mysteriously in January. Initial reports were suicide. 
However, post-mortem reports have placed doubt on the 
pronouncement. 
  Lawrence and a friend, Ron Mitchell, were accosted in Maputo 
by a group of men while walking back to their yacht from a 
nightclub. The robbers allegedly demanded money but shot 
Lawrence as he was reaching for his wallet. Allegations of 
Lawrence's involvement in shady activities surfaced last year at 
the trial of former Howick yacht owner Mark Cronje, who was 
charged with fraud for deliberately sinking his boat. In 
September, Cronje phoned the TRIBUNE, saying he was still being 
threatened and he wanted to leave the country. He said he had 
information about arms deals and a covert military training base 
in Southern Natal. Afterwards, he disappeared and all efforts 
to find him failed. This week Cronje's parents said he and his 
family left for the United States in November.
