FT  02 JUN 92 / Iraq condemns UN border proposals
IRAQ WARNED yesterday that UN proposals for a new border with Kuwait would
'create a permanent nucleus for tension' in the region.
Mr Ahmed Hussein al-Samaraei, the Iraqi foreign minister, said yesterday in
a letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, that 'the
decisions taken by the Iraq-Kuwait border demarcation commission are
illegitimate and constitute a dangerous precedent in the history of the
international organisation'.
The findings by the commission, which have yet to be ratified by the
Security Council, recommend returning to Kuwait the land at Umm Qasr on
which Iraq has during the past 20 years built a naval base. Three jetties
used by the Iraqi navy would revert to Kuwait but the deep-water commercial
port will remain in Iraqi hands.
In addition, the UN commission has re-commended that a strip of territory in
the Rumailah oilfield containing several producing wells should be given
back to Kuwait. Iraq accused Kuwait of illegally taking oil from the field
shortly before its invasion in August 1990.
At both Umm Qasr and Rumailah the UN commission found that Iraq had since
1963 encroached on what was Kuwaiti territory. Had Kuwait chosen to press
its case more strongly for a further portion of the Umm Qasr port it is
likely that the commission would have found in its favour.
Iraq's limited access to the sea has been a cause of repeated conflict with
its neighbours. In September 1980 it abrogated the 1975 Algiers agreement
with Iran on the joint use of the Shatt al-Arab waterway just before
launching its eight-year war with Tehran.
Iraq's warning to the UN yesterday indicates how the commission's findings
on the border with Kuwait will be used by President Saddam Hussein as a
nationalist rallying point and as a further example of his contention that
his country's troubles are primarily the responsibility of the western
powers.
