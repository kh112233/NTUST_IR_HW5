DDC ACCESS FOR AIDS PATIENTS OKD; 
MEDICINE: PROMISING NEW DRUG WILL BE DISTRIBUTED FREE TO THOSE WHO CAN'T USE 
OTHERS. 
The Food and Drug Administration today approved a plan to provide AIDS patients 
who have no other treatment options wider access to the promising drug DDC. 
Under the "expanded access" plan, dideoxycytidine, or DDC, will be distributed 
free to people with AIDS or AIDS-related complex who cannot take the two 
currently available drugs to attack the AIDS virus. 
Those drugs are AZT, the only fully approved AIDS-fighting drug, and DDI, an 
experimental drug already offered through an expanded access program. 
"Everyone involved with finding treatments for AIDS recognizes the critical 
need to provide an option for those individuals who cannot tolerate the 
currently available treatments," said Dr. Waijen Soo of Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., 
which makes DDC. 
Hoffmann-La Roche officials estimated that up to 1,000 AIDS patients may 
qualify for the expanded DDC distribution program, scheduled to begin June 25. 
Patients will only be able to obtain the drug after their doctors contact the 
drug company. 
Karen Kmetik, a spokeswoman for Hoffmann-La Roche in Nutley, N.J., emphasized 
that the safety and effectiveness of DDC are still being tested. But she said 
preliminary results indicate that the drug does not produce the severe anemia 
that is frequently seen in patients taking AZT, nor does it appear to cause the 
inflammation of the pancreas that has been associated with DDI. 
Both DDC and DDI can trigger a nerve disorder that causes pain in the feet and 
hands. But Kmetik said that problem seems to have been reduced for DDC since 
researchers cut the dose they were giving patients.
