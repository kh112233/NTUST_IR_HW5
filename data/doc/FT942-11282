FT  06 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Putting clamps on the copycats
A Danish inventor has developed a system to provide a foolproof safeguard
against the copying of software programs and the development of computer
viruses. It will also supervise networks and prevent accidental, as well as
deliberate, copying, writes Hilary Barnes.
Hans Jessen says his discovery will mean that copying will become impossible
and businesses will be able to prove in court that software has been
tampered with. 'My invention will give the software producer effective
protection technically and legally of the copyright.'
The Danish Innovation Centre, part of the Danish Technological Institute, is
assisting Jessen to find licensees for his invention.
