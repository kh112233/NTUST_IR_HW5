  [Editorial Report] The Exports and Investments Promotion 
Center (CENPRO), a government-owned agency, disclosed that 
exports during January 1994 totalled $207 million, a $5-million 
increase over the same period in 1993. Once again, tourism and 
exports of nontraditional goods led the way despite a fall in 
the export of traditional goods and assembly plant products. 
Revenues from tourism totalled $54 million during January 1994 
representing a 30 percent increase with respect to January 1993. 
Excluding tourism, export revenues totalled $152 million, 5 
percent less than the $160 million received during January 1993.
