DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESIDENTS CAN TRADE YULE TREES FOR COMPOST 
The Los Angeles Sanitation Department is urging residents to trade in their 
Christmas trees for a free bag of compost at a tree recycling drop-off point, 
including sites in Sunland and Encino. 
City workers will accept trees at the seven sites until Jan. 5. The sites will 
be closed on New Year's Day, a city spokeswoman said. 
The city expects to turn more than 10,000 trees into compost and save 100 tons 
of landfill space, she said. 
San Fernando Valley area sites, open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., are at the Balboa 
Sports Center, 17000 Burbank Blvd., and Sunland Park and Recreation Center, 
8651 Foothill Blvd.
