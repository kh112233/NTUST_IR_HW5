FT  11 JUN 93 / Roche announces new treatment for Aids
PRELIMINARY data presented on a new Aids treatment developed by Roche of
Switzerland suggest it is almost as effective as Wellcome's AZT, and is more
effective than AZT when the two medicines are used in combination.
Roche's drug, code-named Ro-31-8959, is a protease inhibitor which affects
production of an enzyme necessary for the Aids virus, HIV, to replicate
effectively. Virus particles without the enzyme appear to be malformed and
non-infectious.
Three studies in Italy, France, and the UK, involving nearly 200 patients,
showed the drug led to significant increases in CD4 cells, the immune cells
attacked by the Aids virus. This was true in patients in early and late
stages of the disease. Clinicians from all three studies said the drug was
extremely well tolerated at effective doses.
The results brought some relief to the annual international Aids conference
in Berlin, where they were unveiled. Data presented earlier this week from a
UK-French study of AZT, the most widespread treatment for Aids, had
confirmed earlier suggestions that the drug was not useful in HIV-positive
patients who had not yet developed symptoms.
The Italian study, involving 96 patients, compared AZT on its own against
AZT with the protease inhibitor (at three different doses), and the protease
inhibitor on its own. It showed Ro-31-8959 monotherapy at 600mg was almost
as good as AZT on its own. But, when combined with AZT at 600mg, there was a
significant increase in the CD4 count.
