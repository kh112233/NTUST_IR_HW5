VET DISABILITY RULES TO BE REVAMPED 
Bowing to a recent federal court ruling, the government today moved to revamp 
rules that have prevented 34,000 veterans from obtaining disability benefits 
for exposure to the defoliant "Agent Orange." 
Proposed new rules published for public comment would authorize the Veterans 
Affairs Department to award disability benefits when there was reasonable doubt 
as to whether a particular disease was statistically linked to exposure. 
The department set an Aug. 17 deadline for comments, and it said it would try 
to have final rules in place by Oct. 1. 
Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski ordered the new rules in May 
after a federal judge in San Francisco threw out the existing rules, concluding 
that they were too restrictive.
