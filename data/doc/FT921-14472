FT  16 JAN 92 / UK set for new social policy clash
BRITAIN last night seemed headed for another clash on social policy with its
European Community partners after the Brussels Commission proposed EC-wide
work restrictions for people under 18 years old.
The draft directive, which Brussels proposes should be adopted by a majority
among EC governments, would bar children under 15 from most regular work,
except for instance in entertainment or delivering newspapers. For those
under 18 years it would ban overtime and most night work.
But Europe's teenagers will still be able to undertake certain types of
light or irregular work, including work at harvest time and night work in
restaurants and bakeries.
EC officials said the main impact would be felt in southern European
countries and Britain, which in 1989 repealed certain work restrictions for
16-18-year-olds, including some provisions of International Labour
Organisation conventions that the UK had earlier signed.
UK officials said the main problem for Britain would be the working time
restrictions for youths of 16 years and older, who, since the 1989 UK
Employment Act, were treated as adults, while the Commission plan went wider
than current legislation in protecting minors from physically risky work.
Brussels yesterday proposed measures to try to stop art thieves and
smugglers exploiting the planned abolition of internal EC border checks by
the end of this year.
The proposal would create a common export licence for designated national
treasures leaving the Community, and a system allowing one EC state to
recover stolen art works from another.
The draft directive, already extensively discussed with the EC governments
that must formally approve it, would not get Greece back the marble friezes
taken by Lord Elgin from the Parthenon in the 19th century and now in the
British Museum.
The restitution procedure only applies to works of art illicitly exported
after December 31 1992.
