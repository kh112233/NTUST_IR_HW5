FT  20 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow improves despite sharp
fall for IBM
Wall Street
EQUITIES showed a mildly firmer tendency yesterday in moderate activity, in
spite of a drop in leading computer issue International Business Machines
(IBM) on a sharply reduced earnings forecast from Soundview Financial,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged ahead 7.15 to 3,261.40, while
advances held a narrow lead over declines by 912 to 773 after a total of
194m shares had changed hands. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was just 0.65 up at
409.80, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks was 1.02
higher at 625.96.
There was little stock market reaction to the release of trade data for
January, which showed a slightly narrower US merchandise trade deficit of
Dollars 5.77bn, compared with a revised Dollars 6bn for December.
IBM fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 85 7/8 in heavy volume after Soundview
Financial cut its first-quarter earnings estimate to 25 cents a share from
the previous 90 cents. Soundview also reduced its 1992 earnings forecast to
Dollars 4.50 from Dollars 6.50 a share.
Burlington Industries led NYSE trading yesterday. The stock was quoted at
Dollars 14 after the textile company returned to the public domain with an
initial public offering of 44.9m shares priced at Dollars 14 each.
The big three auto makers, which have dominated the big board all week, were
actively traded again yesterday. Ford Motor climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars
40 1/8 , near its 52-week high of Dollars 40 5/8 . The company expects to
turn in a first-quarter profit after five consecutive quarterly losses.
Chrysler added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 18 3/8 and General Motors rose
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 38 3/8 .
Harley-Davidson, the last of the big US motorcycle makers, moved ahead
Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 after Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of
the company with a 'buy' rating.
In the pharmaceutical sector, Pfizer initially moved higher following an
analysts meeting where a professor at Yale University said the company's new
Zithromax oral antibiotic had potential for use in the treatment of
gonorrhea, lyme disease, toxoplasmosis in Aids patients and a range of
gastrointestinal infections.
These indications, however, have not been reviewed by the Food and Drug
Administration, which has so far approved the drug to treat respiratory
tract infections, uncomplicated skin infections and chlamydia. The drug is
the first in a new class of antibiotics which have higher tissue
concentrations than conventional treatments such as penicillin. Pfizer
closed unchanged on the day at Dollars 71 1/8 .

THE Toronto composite index staged a further moderate recovery from recent
weakness in a fairly busy trading session, gaining 14.9 to 3,466.7, but
falls led rises by 287 to 271. Volume came to 28.1m shares.
The communications and media sub-group advanced 1.89 per cent as Thomson
Corp rose CDollars 1 to CDollars 16 5/8 . Financial services put on 1.12 per
cent and forest products gained 1.02 per cent.
Cineplex Odeon, which reported decreased losses for 1991, slipped 5 cents to
CDollars 3.95.
Deprenyl Research dropped CDollars 2 5/8 to CDollars 15 1/4 . The company
said the fall was due to a sell recommendation from a Los Angeles-based
analyst.
