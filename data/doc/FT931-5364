FT  06 MAR 93 / Militants' warning to foreigners in Egypt
A MILITANT Islamic group claiming to be behind recent attacks on tourists in
Egypt yesterday warned foreigners to leave the country and said foreign
investments 'could soon become a target.'
The warning was issued to the BBC in Cairo and in it the Gama'a
al-Islamiyya, or Islamic groups, also claimed responsibility for the killing
on Thursday of a police officer and his son in Upper Egypt. Diplomats in
Cairo said they were 'looking into' the warning, but were treating it with
circumspection.
Groups claiming to be part of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya regularly send faxes
to news organisations to claim or disclaim responsibility for violent
incidents in Egypt. Similar warnings were issued by these groups before the
spate of attacks on tourists, which began last summer.
The Gama'a al-Islamiyya claims to be behind the attacks on tourists in Cairo
and Upper Egypt which have already claimed the lives of at least three
foreign visitors and an Egyptian.
The most serious was the bombing last Friday of a crowded coffee-house in
central Cairo in which a Swedish and a Turkish tourist were killed, along
with one Egyptian.
In yesterday's warning, the Gama'a Islamiyya said it 'calls all Arab and
foreign countries' to advise their citizens to leave Egypt and 'preserve
their lives'. It urged 'Egyptians, Arabs and foreigners' to 'call off' their
investments in the country. 'Investments, but not the investors, could soon
become a target to our just revenge,' it said.
