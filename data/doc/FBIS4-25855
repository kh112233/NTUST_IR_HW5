  [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- All government agencies 
will join hands to promote the National Information 
Infrastructure (NII) as part of the government's efforts to 
sharpen Taiwan's international competitiveness and to build 
Taiwan into an Asia- Pacific business operation center, a 
cabinet minister said Wednesday [14 June]. 
  Hsia Han-min, a minister without portfolio, said Premier 
Lien 
Chan gave the instruction on the NII program at a Tuesday 
meeting of the information-promotion task force. 
  To effectively promote the NII, also known as the 
"information superhighway," a supraministerial task force and a 
private consultative committee also will be established, Hsia 
pointed out. 
  Hsia, who was appointed to head the task force, pledged that 
the group will seek concerted efforts from both the government 
and the private sector to achieve Taiwan's information 
infrastructure goals. 
  Preliminary estimates show that government investment in 
various information and telecommunications projects might top 
NT$100 billion (U.S.$3.69 billion) in the next six years, he 
said. 
  The investment will have a great impact on the development 
of 
the domestic industrial base and on the well-being of the 
nation, he added. 
  Kuo Yun, president of the Institute for Information 
Industry, 
stressed that the domestic information industry will benefit 
from the NII program because of the host of trade opportunities 
it will bring. 
  The NII, which will use various information and 
telecommunications expertise to quickly transmit words, 
graphics, voices, and visions via computer networks, will 
greatly change lifestyles here, he elaborated. 
  For example, he said, upon completion of the information 
superhighway, students could choose to "attend" school at home 
via computer hookup, and people could engage in activities such 
as watching movies and shopping without going outside.
