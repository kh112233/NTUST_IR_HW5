  [Text] Fuzhou, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The first China Buddhist 
medicine symposium came to a close today in Wuyishan City, in 
east China's Fujian Province. 
  About 90 experts and scholars from the medical community of 
15 provinces and municipalities across the country attended the 
three-day conference, which received more than 70 papers. The 
meeting also announced the establishment of Wuyishan Society of 
Buddhist Medicine. 
  Participants in the symposium held that Buddhist medicine is 
a combination of natural science and humane studies, and is an 
important part of traditional Chinese medicine. 
  They believed that Buddhist medicine has also proved 
effective in curing some difficult and complicated cases of 
illness in the fields of surgery, gynecology, ophthalmology and 
in curing cancers, but they also stressed the need to strengthen 
research and development of Buddhist medicine and enhance 
exchanges with overseas corresponding organizations. 
  The conference heard that scientific research and teaching 
of 
Buddhist medicine have made great progress in the past ten and 
more years. 
  So far, Buddhist clinics, hospitals and related academic 
research institutes have been established in a dozen provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions, as well as at grass-roots 
Buddhist associations and in many famous temples.
