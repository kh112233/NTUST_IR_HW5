FT  29 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley view is challenged
THE views of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, on the links between
poverty and ill-health were yesterday called into question by Professor
Peter Townsend, her former tutor at Essex University.
In a letter to the health secretary, published in today's British Medical
Journal, Prof Townsend - who was chairman of the Child Poverty Action Group
when Mrs Bottomley worked there - says he understands from a wide variety of
her speeches that she no longer agrees with the evidence on poverty and
ill-health that she accepted in 1971.
'What is indisputable is that as an undergraduate and then as a research
worker for CPAG, far from regarding such evidence as defeatist talk, you not
only accepted it but added to it,' the letter says.
