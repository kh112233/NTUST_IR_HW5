FT  10 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Scheme to increase tourist arrivals
The Indian government has launched a tourism promotion programme to increase
the number of foreign visitors from 1.76m to 5m over three years.
A calmer political climate and further opening up of the economy have led to
an increase in tourist arrivals, to 1.76m from 1.5m the previous year.
Foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased by 14 per cent to Dollars
1.47bn for 1993-94, according to figures published by the Ministry of
Tourism and Civil Aviation.
Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, tourism minister, said Bombay airport, the country's
prime entry point, alone handled 164,000 domestic and international flights,
an increase of more than 150 per cent in a decade. Liberalisation of
domestic routes last year helped ease both congestion and non-availability
of seats on flights within the country.
Tourism is India's third-largest foreign exchange earner, and has more of a
range of destinations to offer than most countries in the world. But the
country accounts for 0.2 per cent of international tourism, largely because
of inadequate infrastructure.
Officials in the Tourism Ministry say a big constraint is a lack of
middle-level hotels. 'The choice we offer the foreign tourist is limited,'
said a senior official. The foreign tourist must choose between expensive
five-star comfort or small hotels that cater to backpackers and lack the
most basic of amenities. 'Our plan is to offer something to the tourist
between the very wealthy ones and the business travellers, and those who
have very little money to spend.'
Foreign hotel chains are enthusiastic about the more relaxed investment
rules after liberalisation (the hotel industry has always been dominated by
private companies), and are flocking to India with joint ventures. The
government estimates that foreign investment is worth at least Dollars 250m
(Pounds 168m) in the hotel industry.
The Australian Southern Pacific hotels plans to start a series of three-star
travel lodges in main cities. The Oberoi group is linking with Accor of
France to start a network of motels across the country. Kamats, a chain of
south Indian restaurants, is linking with the Japanese Dai Ici and Pearl
Hotels, to offer budget accommodation at Buddhist pilgrimage destinations.
The Indian Taj Group, which operates some of India's finest hotels, plans a
350-room hotel in Bombay to supplement its famous Taj Mahal, and a series of
Club Med resorts in association with the French company. And a group of
non-resident Indians has got together with the Irish company, Deltic
Management, to build a Rs8.7bn (Pounds 186m) 600-room floating luxury hotel
in Bombay.
