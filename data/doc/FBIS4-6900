  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 23 -- The Vietnam oil and gas 
corporation (Petrovietnam) strongly protests the American oil 
company Crestone in a contract with China for conducting surveys 
for oil drilling in Vietnam's special economic zone and 
continental shelf, says a statement released today by 
Petrovietnam. 
  Crestone signed the so called 'Wan En 21 Contract' with 
China 
in May 1992 to explore oil and gas. The area is in fact the Tu 
Chinh shoal well within the special economic zone and 
continental shelf of Vietnam, the statement says. The signing 
of the said contract is a serious encroachment of the Vietnamese 
territorial sovereignty, causing worries for organizations and 
individuals doing oil and gas business in the region and the 
world, the statement remarks. 
  It recalled that a spokesperson for Vietnam's Foreign 
Ministry on Wednesday vehemently protested the April 18, 1994 
announcement by Crestone on its current seismic surveys and 
preparations for test drilling in the so called 'Wan En 21'. 
  The statement concludes by demanding Crestone put an end 
without condition to all its activities on oil and gas in the Tu 
Chinh area of Vietnam.
