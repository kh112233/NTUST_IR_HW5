  [Text] The Red Command [CV] is a criminal organization 
created in 1979 at the Candido Mendes Prison on Ilha Grande 
(RJ). At present, it is estimated that nearly 6,500 armed men 
are working directly for the CV, with another 300,000 persons 
linked to the organization indirectly. 
  Their activities range from drug trafficking to holdups of 
banks and armored cars, as well as kidnapping. The money 
collected is used to purchase large volumes of drugs. 
  The CV uses sophisticated weapons, such as 7.65 pistols, 9 
mm 
Beretta, Uzi, and Ingram machine guns, automatic rifles, 
grenades, repeating rifles, special laser sights, special steel 
ammunition, and both antitank and antiaircraft military armament. 
  Yesterday, the Military Police [PM] mounted a genuine war 
operation, with 503 men, in an attempt to dismantle the Red 
Command's first QG [headquarters] in Sao Paulo. The PM located a 
CV observation post at the eastern end of Sao Paulo, and 
detected the beginning of the formation of a network of 
"informers" in the neighborhood. No one from the CV was arrested. 
  The blitz began at 0800, ending at 1600. Also used were 40 
dogs, 22 horses, 50 light and 13 heavy vehicles, one helicopter, 
and all types of weapons. 
  Within the past 20 days, the ROTA (Tobias de Aguiar 
Exhibition Patrols) learned of the CV's presence in Cidade 
Tiradentes. The CV had already purchased three apartments in the 
same building of a housing complex in the upper part of a 
locality known as "Morro Disso," as well as several vehicles and 
weapons. 
  On 24 February, in that building, the ROTA arrested the 
siblings Antonio Julio Ellio, aged 32; Paulo Sergio Ellio, 25; 
Paulo Sergio Ellio, 25; Johnny Marcos Ellio, 23; and Nilva 
Juciara Ellio, 18. Five other persons escaped. Two of them, 
discovered later, were killed in a shootout with the police. 
Three are fugitives. 
  Ten days ago, the PM engaged in further patrolling, this 
time 
by helicopter. The police discovered that, in the upper part of 
the same building, a CV observation post was being operated. 
Since the site is located at the highest point in the district, 
from which the CV's lookouts were observing all movements, the 
PM decided not to invade the premises again. They feared that a 
shootout would endanger the other residents. 
  Yesterday, Colonel Carlos Augusto de Mello, aged 51, 
commander of the CPM (Metropolitan Police Command), remarked: 
"The information confirms the reports and the indications. The 
Red Command is attempting to set up its factions here." 
  According to the colonel, the CV selected Cidade Tiradentes 
because the district, with nearly 500,000 inhabitants, is quite 
similar to the Rio de Janeiro State Lowlands. He observed: "It 
is a district with a low income population and many premises 
suitable for hiding. It is situated far from the city, and has 
virtually only one access road, facilitating its control by the 
CV." 
  Yesterday, the PM divided the district into eight sectors. 
Covering each of them were 30 men from the shock platoon, two 
policewomen, five men, four dogs, two motorcycles, and one ROTA 
car carrying four men. All were armed. Blockades were set up on 
the only two access roads to the district: Santa Terezinha 
Avenue and Inacio Monteiro Street. 
  During the blitz, 1,023 persons were accosted, 610 vehicles 
were searched, one minor was taken into custody for stealing a 
television set, 41 persons were held as suspects, and eight were 
detained for questioning.
