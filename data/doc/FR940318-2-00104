SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is in the process of developing a guidance document entitled ``Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls
Guide.'' The draft guide is now available to the public through NTIS. 


The guide is designed to serve several purposes. First, FDA anticipates that it will help members of the commercial
fish and fishery products industry identify and control potential hazards associated with the fish and fishery products
that they handle and process. In addition to human food safety hazards and controls, the guide will address controls
associated with quality, marketability, and economic fraud. 
The guide also is designed to help members of the seafood industry develop and implement Hazard Analysis Critical
Control Point (HACCP) plans for their operations, as will be required if FDA adopts the proposed regulations. The
proposed regulations provide that seafood processors and importers must establish HACCP systems of preventive
controls to ensure the safety of the food they produce. The guide provides information that processors and importers
can use in the development of their HACCP plans. This information consists largely of an identification of hazards
that can affect seafood and a discussion of the control measures that can keep these hazards from actually occurring
or that can at least minimize the likelihood of their occurrence. 
Another purpose of the guide is to help consumers and the public to understand seafood safety in terms of the hazards
that are presented by seafood and the controls that can be applied to those hazards. 
FDA believes that the guide will assist Federal and State regulatory officials in developing uniform and consistent
regulatory strategies and controls for seafood. This guide should be useful in the evaluation of HACCP plans and systems
by both State and Federal regulatory officials.
Comments concerning the draft Guide were solicited with the announcement of the proposed regulations in the 

Federal Register

 of January 28, 1994. FDA will study the comments it receives, revise the draft guide as warranted, and then issue the
guide. The agency intends to issue the guide by the time that the proposed HACCP regulations for seafood are issued
in final form, should the agency decide to do so. 
Interested persons may, on or before April 28, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this draft guide. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments and the draft guide may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
Comments received after April 28, 1994, will be considered in the drafting of subsequent editions of the guide, as
the agency finds it necessary. FDA will publish subsequent editions based on public comments and as circumstances
warrant, e.g., as new knowledge on hazards is obtained or new types of controls are developed.
