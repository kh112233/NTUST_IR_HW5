  [Text] Estonian delegation at Estonian-European Union free 
trade negotiations, after returning from Brussels, gave a news 
conference saying progress had been made while several issues 
remained to be discussed further. 
  Latvia has closed the negotiations and is ready to initial 
the agreement, the head of the Estonian delegation, Priit 
Kolbre, said. 
  The main problems between Estonia and EU are in the field of 
textiles, Signe Ratso from the Estonian Economics Ministry said. 
Estonia is opposed to the double check system EU requests which 
would mean that Estonia should impose administrative control 
over all textile products moving to European markets. That 
contradicts Estonia's economics policy and understanding of free 
trade, Ratso added. Besides, imposing such mechanisms and 
issuing licenses is very costly. At the moment, Estonia enjoys 
tariff- and quota-free access to European markets, Priit Pallum 
from the Economics Ministry remarked. 
  Another field under negotiations were fishery, customs and 
agriculture. 
  Estonia is satisfied with the results achieved in the 
fishery 
group and, hopefully, EU member countries will accept the 
quotas, Lauri Vaarja, head of the Estonian Fishery Board, said. 
  The negotiation on agricultural produce must also continue 
as 
Estonia views conditions included in the protocol on market 
protection system unfavourable, deputy chancellor of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Ruve Shank, said. Shank also said 
Estonia opposed the so-called joint Baltic quota proposed by the 
EU which would mean that the country which is the first to bring 
its check-up systems to European level would benefit most of the 
quotas. 
  Estonian-EU free trade agreement is expected to be 
initialled 
in the beginning of July and signed in October or November. In 
that case it can take effect on January 1, 1995 as planned.
