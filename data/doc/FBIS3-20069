  [Text] British residents in Algeria are being advised to 
leave the country because of the deteriorating security 
situation, the Foreign Office said. The warning comes after the 
latest killings by Islamic militants. There are an estimated 
200 Britons resident in Algeria, including many working in the 
oil industry. 
  The death toll in Algeria has mounted since elections were 
cancelled two years ago after the Islamic Salvation Front had 
seemed set to sweep to power. 
  Threats to foreigners, whom Islamic militants hold 
responsible for supporting the government, have multiplied and 
more than a dozen journalists, including a French TV cameraman, 
have been killed in recent months. 
  The Foreign Office has been advising people against going to 
Algeria for some months. 
  The new warning comes after the murder on Tuesday night [22 
March] of two Frenchmen working in the offices of a weekly 
newspaper in Algiers. Gunmen burst into the offices of HEBDO 
LIBERE, killing two employees and wounding three. 
  A Foreign Office spokesman said this was seen as a 
significant escalation of the threat to all foreigners in the 
country. All British residents were "strongly advised" to leave 
Algeria unless they had compelling reasons to remain, he said.
