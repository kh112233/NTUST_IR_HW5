DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TAX PREPARER GETS PROBATION FOR FRAUD 
A Sylmar man who prepared fraudulent tax returns by claiming deductions for 
phony church donations was sentenced Tuesday in federal court to three years 
probation and 300 hours of community service, a spokesman with the Internal 
Revenue Service said. 
Rudolf Kies, 57, was also ordered by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie to 
stop preparing income tax returns while he is on probation, Assistant U.S. 
Atty. 
Nancy Spiegel said. 
Kies pleaded guilty April 9 to three counts of preparing fraudulent income tax 
returns in 1983 and 1984. Kies, a tax preparer, falsely claimed that his 
clients made deductions to the Mission Church of America, which was 
incorporated in 1976 and based in Kies' house. Kies listed himself as the 
church's president and would send his clients receipts for the phony donations. 
The reported deductions saved eight clients -- most from the San Fernando 
Valley -- more than $14,000 in tax payments. Internal Revenue Service 
investigators said none of the donations were made. 
Kies' clients will be responsible for paying the back taxes, but no charges 
will be brought against them, investigators said.
