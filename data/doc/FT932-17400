SIR Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the British and Irish
Governments were ready to resume negotiations with the political parties in
the province.
He was in Dublin to visit Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister. They had a
working lunch at the Department of Foreign Affairs before attending the
World Cup soccer match between the Republic and Northern Ireland teams at
Lansdowne Road.
The ministers also discussed the recent upsurge in terrorist violence
including the IRA's Warrington bombings and the murders of six Catholics by
the UFF last week.
