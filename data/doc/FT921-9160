FT  13 FEB 92 / Cavallo warns of tough line on inflation
MR Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, yesterday said his
stabilisation policies were under threat from inflation, writes John Barham
in Buenos Aires.
'We will not throw away all we have achieved. We will persevere and continue
with the changes,' he said.
The spectre of rising inflation is already setting off pre-emptive price
increases and index-linking. Mr Cavallo has responded by demanding companies
keep prices down and unleashing tax inspectors on offending businesses.
Mr Cavallo's economic liberalisation policies have steadily lowered
inflation, which fell to a monthly rate of 0.6 per cent in December although
flaring in January to 3 per cent. Mr Cavallo has forecast inflation of 6-7
per cent for 1992; last year prices rose 84 per cent.
The minister warned that 'without economic stability it will not be possible
to grow or to maintain political stability'.
He repeated that inflation would simply lead to recession and called on
companies to invest more, raise production and lower prices.
The minister is keenly aware that further inflation will increase political
pressure to devalue the peso, the new currency introduced in January.
