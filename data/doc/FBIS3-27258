  [Text] Shanghai, February 21 (XINHUA) -- The population of 
China's biggest city, Shanghai, last year showed a negative 
growth rate for the first time. 
  Statistics from the Shanghai Statistics Bureau show that 
Shanghai's natural population growth rate stood at minus 0.8 per 
thousand in 1993, declining further from the rate of the 
previous year, 0.21 per thousand. 
  A governmental official says that the decline in population 
is due to the city's social and cultural development, as well as 
that of medicine and health care. 
  In contrast to the city's population decline, which is 
calculated from the number of citizens with permanent residence 
permits, the official said, the growth rate of the mobile 
population is alarmingly high. 
  The Shanghai government is going to take specific measures 
to 
tackle the problem, he said.
