  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, has sent 
a message of congratulations to the ANC on winning South 
Africa's first all-race elections. The message to the ANC 
president, Mr. Mandela, said: Your resounding victory is a 
victory for all South Africans who, for decades, have valiantly 
struggled against the evil forces of apartheid and racism. It 
is also a victory for all Africans on the continent and in the 
diaspora and progressive forces around the world who have stood 
resolutely by the majority of South Africans throughout the long 
and difficult days of their struggle. 
  The message said the ANC's victory vindicates the justness 
of 
the struggle for the eradication of apartheid and racism from 
the African Continent. It expressed the hope that Mr. Mandela's 
administration will find strength and wisdom to bring to 
fruition the noble aspirations of the majority of South Africans 
both black and white.
