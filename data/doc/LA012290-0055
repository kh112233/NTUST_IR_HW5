TEACHERS DELAY A STAND ON SPENDING PLAN 
The policy-making council of the California Teachers Assn., meeting in Los 
Angeles, voted unanimously Sunday to adopt a "watch" position on a proposed 
amendment to the state Constitution that would liberalize state spending 
limits. 
Before the association endorses the so-called state Constitutional Amendment 1, 
which would modify the 1979 "Gann Limit," leaders want drafters of the measure 
to spell out more clearly guarantees on education financing, said association 
President Ed Foglia. 
The association's 500-member State Council of Education, which ended its 
quarterly meeting Sunday, is scheduled to meet again in March. 
"If they (those drafting the amendment) carry out what they say they're going 
to do and give us what they say they will, I believe that the vote will be 
favorable in March," Foglia said. 
The amendment, backed by Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative leaders, will 
be on the ballot in June. If approved by the voters, it would permit the 
imposition of a 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax to improve transportation and 
ease traffic congestion. 
Two months ago, the 200,000-member teachers' organization had threatened to 
wage a war to defeat the amendment, believing it could erase many of the gains 
won by Proposition 98, which was passed by voters in 1988. 
The teachers said that the amendment, as originally proposed, had introduced a 
loophole that would have allowed a reduction in education funds from 
Proposition 98, which provides that 40% of the state budget must go to schools.
