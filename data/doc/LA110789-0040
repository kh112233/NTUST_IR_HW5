KAREN CARPENTER: SHE HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN; 
POP: NEW CARPENTERS' ALBUM FEATURES FOUR SONGS FROM KAREN'S ILL-FATED SOLO 
COLLECTION. THE ALBUM SUGGESTS SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD A CAREER AS A SOLOIST. 
KarenandRichard. 
Those names were linked so often in the 1970s, when the Carpenters were the 
hottest duo in pop music, that many pop fans came to think of the pair as one. 
That was fine early in the decade when the Downey brother-and-sister team was 
turning out instant standards such as "We've Only Just Begun" and "Close to 
You," but it started to bother Karen in the late 1970s when the duo's fortunes 
declined sharply. 
In an effort to establish an independent identity at last, Karen moved to New 
York in 1979 to record a solo album with Grammy-winning producer Phil Ramone, 
whose credits include hits by Billy Joel, Paul Simon and Barbra Streisand. 
But the album was never released. Instead, Karen and Richard reteamed to record 
a traditional Carpenters album, which failed to reverse their downward career 
momentum. And in 1983 -- after a brief, failed marriage -- Karen died at 32 of 
complications from anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder which had plagued her 
since the mid '70s. 
With her death, the "lost Karen tapes" became even more of a source of mystery 
among fans. But they remained unavailable -- until now. 
Four songs from that shelved 1979 album are featured -- along with eight 
previously unreleased Carpenters recordings -- on a just-released Carpenters 
album, "Love-lines." 
The recordings -- released to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the 
Carpenters' signing with A&amp;M Records -- suggest that Karen could work 
effectively outside the Carpenters' mellow pop sound and could have gone on to 
a thriving solo career. 
The big question: Why was the solo album put in limbo? 
The bigger question: If the album had been released and been successful, would 
things have turned out differently for Karen? 
The suspicion in some music industry quarters has been that Karen shelved the 
solo album out of loyalty to Richard, who was anxious to get back to work in 
1979 after recovering from a Quaalude dependency. (Richard's dependency was 
revealed in CBS-TV's "The Karen Carpenter Story," the highest-rated TV movie of 
the 1988-89 season.) 
In an interview tied to the release of the new album, Richard Carpenter, 43, 
was candid about the conflicts within the Carpenters in the late '70s. 
"Karen would mention every now and again that it would be nice to receive some 
accolades as a solo singer," he said in an A&amp;M office in Hollywood. "Of 
course, that made me feel badly, because we were a duo. Lord knows, she was the 
star of the duo, but that's not quite the same." 
Richard said that he had a less-than-supportive reaction to Karen's 
announcement -- just after he had begun a six-week drug rehabilitation program 
-- that she was planning to record an album without him. 
"I probably said something like, 'You're just abandoning ship, just taking off 
and doing what you want to do.' I was feeling sorry for myself," he said. "It 
was a combination of feeling I was being abandoned -- which was anything but 
the case looking back on it -- and thinking this was a perfect time for her to 
get some treatment for her disorder. So I was not happy, and I told her as 
much." 
Richard, who produced and arranged the Carpenters' long string of hits, also 
acknowledged that he felt threatened by Karen's teaming up with another 
producer. 
"I'm human and it did cross my mind that something could come out of this and 
just explode at which time I would be going through a number of emotions. I'd 
be happy for Karen because I always felt that she should have been in the Top 
5. On the other hand, being sensitive and feeling I'd done a good job for the 
Carpenters I would have been a little bit upset." 
In a separate interview from his New York office, producer Phil Ramone 
discussed his and Karen's objective on the album. "We were thinking two things: 
How do we make a record that doesn't sound like the Carpenters, and what could 
we say lyrically in these songs that has a more mature attitude?" 
The solo album included a spare, intimate reading of the sexually direct "Make 
Believe It's Your First Time" and a bluesy version of Paul Simon's "Still Crazy 
After All These Years" -- though Karen, mindful of her prim image -- had Simon 
change the line, "4 in the morning / crapped out / yawning" to the more demure 
"crashed out." 
"Karen was frustrated by the Goody Two-Shoes image, but she was torn," Ramone 
said. "She wanted to do try new things, but then she'd turn around and say, 
'We're going to do another Carpenters Christmas special.' I kept saying, 'The 
(Andy) Williams family even got past that one.' " 
Ramone still remembers the day in early 1980 when he and Karen played the album 
for Richard and A&amp;M founders Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss. 
"The silence was deafening," he said. "Richard didn't say much and still 
hasn't. He's accepted these songs kind of like stepchildren. Karen was always 
the sweetheart of A&amp;M, and Herb and Jerry reacted almost like it was their 
teen-age daughter I was messing with." 
Alpert, who wrote the liner notes to the Carpenters' debut album and found the 
team's breakthrough hit, "Close to You," declined to be interviewed for this 
story. 
Richard Carpenter remembers giving Karen a mixed, but essentially lukewarm, 
review of the solo project. 
"I probably said it was very nice," he said. "It certainly is well-produced and 
well-assembled. But some of it was disco, and I'm not a disco fan, and I 
thought she was singing a little bit too high on some of the songs." 
And Carpenter applied some not-so-subtle pressure on Karen by telling her how 
eager he was to begin work on the next Carpenters album. "I was much better by 
then and was kicking myself for what I had done to my life," he said. "So I 
mentioned that whenever she was ready, I was ready. I had all the tunes set to 
go." 
The deciding factor came when A&amp;M executives asked Karen and Ramone to go 
back into the studio to record a few more songs for the solo project. 
"It was up to Karen to decide if she wanted to spend more time on it or not," 
Richard said. "She didn't and that was that. I've gotten a lot of letters 
through the years since Karen passed on kind of accusing me of not releasing 
the solo album. It's not my doing at all. It's Karen's wishes I'm honoring." 
In a 1981 interview, Karen said that Richard's desire to get back to work took 
precedence over completing the solo project. But Karen added that she valued 
the solo experience. "It was fun cutting it and seeing that I could do all that 
-- sing a different type of tune and work with different people. I was scared 
to death beforehand. I basically knew one producer, one arranger, one studio, 
one record company and that was it. . . . I'm used to being part of a duo. 
Richard's like a third arm to me." 
Stung by the cool reception at the playback session, Ramone and Karen went to 
Mexico for a vacation. "I watched this girl disintegrate in front of me," 
Ramone said. "It was hard for her to express anger, but sometimes she'd be 
sitting there and she'd say, 'Why is this happening? What did I do wrong? 
Should we listen to the tape? Is it the mix?' " 
But Ramone said that Karen was ultimately proud of the album: "It was the first 
step to her standing on her own and also the last chance. 
"I truly believe that if she had made it through this she could have gone on to 
have a long career," Ramone said. "A lot of the pop songs and movie songs and 
duets of the '80s would have been hers. 
"A voice like Karen's -- rich, womanly -- comes along once every 20 years. 
Voices like that should have a chance to do a variety of things."
