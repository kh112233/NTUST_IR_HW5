FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: Procter gives way in labelling
dispute
PROCTER &amp; Gamble's high-profile dispute with the US Food and Drug
Administration over the labelling of its Citrus Hill orange juice as 'fresh'
has ended in victory for the federal authorities.
P&amp;G, a large consumer products manufacturer, said yesterday that it would
delete the word 'fresh' from its Citrus Hill Fresh Choice label from the
middle of next month.
The company still maintains that its labelling was not inaccurate, but said
that consumers and retailers had become thoroughly confused.
Food-labelling has become a highly-politicised matter in the US, and the FDA
gave the first indications of a new, and tougher, stance earlier this week
when it seized stocks of Citrus Hill.
P&amp;G said yesterday that the seized stock - which was originally destined for
a supermarket customer - had been moved to another warehouse and would
probably be donated to a foodbank.
It declined to say how much the episode had cost the company.
