AIRPORT X-RAY NABS OXNARD MAN 
An Oxnard man was arrested at the Burbank Airport after security officers 
discovered he was attempting to carry two guns, a knife and a small amount of 
drugs onto a commercial flight to Oakland, Burbank police said today. 
Arthur Schwab, 43, was arrested at 6 p.m. Thursday at the U.S. Air gate after 
airport security officers spotted a knife in his briefcase as it went through 
an X-ray screening machine, Burbank Police Sgt. Don Goldberg said. 
Schwab was then detained and the briefcase was opened. Officers found two 
handguns, one of which was dismantled, ammunition for the guns, the knife and 
plastic bags containing small amounts of cocaine and marijuana, Goldberg said. 
Schwab was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession and was taken to Los 
Angeles County-USC Medical Center because he complained of chest pains during 
the arrest, Goldberg said. According to a police report on the incident, Schwab 
told police he was under medication for an unspecified illness and had 
forgotten he had the weapons in the briefcase.
