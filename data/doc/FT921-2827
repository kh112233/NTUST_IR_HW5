FT  18 MAR 92 / Pollution reaches record level in Mexico City
MEXICO City's ozone level has hit an all-time high, recording 398 points on
the Imeca air quality scale on Monday. This is four times higher than the
maximum one-hour exposure per year recommended by the World Health
Organisation.
This level, described by the government as 'very dangerous', sparked off an
emergency action plan under which all schools were closed. The programme
which prevents cars from circulating for one day a week was extended to two
days, and 194 of the city's largest industries had to cut production by
between 50 and 75 per cent.
Ozone is a secondary pollutant formed when hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides
mix in sunlight. High levels of the pollutant restrict breathing, irritate
the eyes and can cause headaches. In the longer run it may exacerbate lung
diseases.
Mr Manuel Camacho Solis, Mexico City's mayor, said he would announce
measures next week to improve the city's air quality. The government has
recently closed scores of factories for not complying with tougher emission
standards and ordered taxis and minibuses to use cleaner fuels.
