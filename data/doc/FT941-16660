FT  08 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome rallies
News of the pricing structure for SmithKline Beecham's new herpes treatment
Famvir saw a sharp turnaround in sentiment for Wellcome as investors decided
it lessened the chances of a price war with the latter's Zovirax drug.
Wellcome shares, which had been 16 adrift at one stage, rallied on the news
that Famvir would only be marginally cheaper than Zovirax, and closed 7 up
at 689p. Analysts had been expecting a price differential of up to 25 per
cent in favour of Famvir. SmithKline added a penny to 395p. Mr Andrew Porter
at UBS said that the diminished prospects of a herpes price war was good
news for both companies.
Elsewhere in the drugs sector, Medeva announced the development of a new
oral vaccine for hepatitis with Proteus International. The former jumped 9
to 149p, and the latter 17 to 448p.
The strong market trend, a weighty broker's recommendation and figures from
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showing an 11.6 per cent rise
in the number of new cars sold last year all combined to boost the motor
dealing stocks.
A buy recommendation from UBS favoured Lex Service, where the shares jumped
27 to 482p, Evans Halshaw, up 17 at 432p, and Appleyard Group, 7 better at
148p. The broker said: 'We remain particularly positive on UK car dealers
which are in the early stages of recovery and generally well financed.' A
Kleinwort Benson recommendation continued to power Reg Vardy and the shares
put on 8 to 193p.
Shares in T&amp;N jumped 16 to 232p, with Credit Lyonnais reported to have had
the day's big buyer. Smith New Court were also said to be recommending the
stock.
Rank Organisation refused to comment on market rumours that the leisure
group would announce a new non-executive chairman with its results next
week. Strongly being tipped for the post is the chairman of SG Warburg, Sir
David Sholey. Rank shares added 3 to 1034p.
A positive note from NatWest Securities boosted several stocks in the oil
sector. These included BP, 1 1/2 firmer at 372 1/2 p in volume of 8.2m,
while Enterprise Oil finished 7 ahead at 469p, with Smith New Court said to
favour the stock.
Food retailers continued to attract interest. Kwik Save was helped by a UBS
recommendation and the shares climbed 10 to 627p. Argyll added 6 to 305p.
Stores stocks largely shrugged off the frosty Christmas message from Dixons
on Thursday. Argos, which had retreated on the former's profit warning,
rebounded 9 to 383p. But Kingfisher was again under pressure on fears that
its Comet subsidiary may have suffered the same fate as Dixons. The shares
slid 18 to 729p. Burton ,where talk in the market suggests margins may also
be under pressure, slipped a penny to 67 1/2 p. Dixons rallied 4 to 244p.
However, talk of strong high street sales in non-electrical goods was
confirmed after the market closed by Allders, which said its December sales
were 10 per cent higher. The shares were up 12 at 230p at the market close.
Improved trading at Lloyds Chemist saw the shares add 3 to 358p.
In a strong media sector, United Newspapers fell 23 to 662p, believed to be
on a downgrading from NatWest Securities. Bid speculation over Reuters
continued, pushing shares up 41 to 1864p.
Shares in Tomkins advanced 8 to 262p in trade of 4.7m. NatWest Securities
yesterday issued a buy recommendation on the stock.
Meanwhile, SG Warburg upgraded its stance on the electricity sector to
overweight, although cautioned on possible earnings disappointments in the
spring results season. Panmure Gordon was also positive, tipping Northern
Electric, up 28 to 724p, as its Rec for 1994.
Further weakness in the property majors ended a glum week for the leaders
which have failed to build on their strong year-end performance. Worst hit
yesterday were Land Securities, down 2 to 770p, and MEPC, off 4 to 516p.
However, Mr Robert Kynoch at NatWest Securities remains positive. 'The
fundamentals that supported the market in 1993 have not changed,' he said.
