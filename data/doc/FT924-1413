FT  18 DEC 92 / Doctors seek talks on NHS funding
LEADERS of the British Medical Association yesterday called for an urgent
meeting with Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, to discuss
National Health Service funding problems.
The move comes as some hospitals and health authorities are reducing
activity to avoid overspending in this financial year.
Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, BMA council chairman, said doctors were dismayed that
predictions of the government's NHS reforms failing to solve the service's
problems were being confirmed.
The decision to approach Mrs Bottomley came after a meeting of the BMA's
general practitioners' committee yesterday, at which family doctors
complained of growing difficulties in obtaining treatment for patients. Last
week members of the consultants' committee reported concerns over hospital
bed closures and cancelled operating sessions.
'What is now needed is a fresh look at the level of resources which would
ensure that the NHS can provide the care that the public requires,' Dr
Lee-Potter said.
Mrs Bottomley has taken the view that hospitals must work within the
financial constraints of their contracts with health authorities and GPs,
and not expect to be bailed out late in the financial year if they
overspend.
Critics argue, however, that the central problem is inadequate funding. The
BMA said yesterday that the new system of health financing had 'made the
continuing underfunding of the NHS even more apparent'.
Costs of restructuring London's health services under the Tomlinson report
proposals may well have been underestimated and 'half-measures will be
extremely damaging', Britain's medical royal colleges warned yesterday. The
colleges called for full costs to be recognised before implementation was
undertaken.
