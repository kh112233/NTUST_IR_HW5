  [Text] Tallinn, May 25, BNS -- Estonian Environment 
Minister Andres Tarand and Lauri Vaarja, the general director of 
the Fishing Department, returned today from Sweden where they 
attended a fishing conference of the Baltic coast nations. On 
the agenda of the conference were the situation with the stocks 
of fish, fishing statistics and exchange of information. 
  The meeting discussed the decline in the stocks of cod in 
the 
Baltic and the need to improve statistics on cod fishing, as 
well as diseases of Baltic salmon and the possibility of joint 
reasearch into their reasons. 
  Vaarja reported to the meeting on Estonian statistics 
concerning stocks of fish, noting that collecting complete 
overall statistics is difficult, since the task of amassing data 
has been laid on local governments. 
  The participants decided that, in order to improve catch 
statistics, the Baltic Sea states should exchange information 
about all fishing vessels that put in at their ports and prevent 
illicit port visits. 
  Tarand said in an interview with BNS that coordinating 
cooperation between Baltic coast nations on the level of prime 
ministers is one of the opportunities to improve information 
exchange. 
  The meeting in Sweden also touched upon the stock of seals 
in 
the Baltic. Although seals pose a threat to fish, they are in 
jeopardy themselves due to environmental pollution. 
  The next fishing conference was set for the beginning of 
1995.
