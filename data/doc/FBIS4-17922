  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 27, BNS -- Dvigatel and Baltiyets, two 
former Soviet armaments factories, are to be entered on the list 
of Estonian enterprises that will be privatized with the help of 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD], 
Vaino Sarnet, the director of the Estonian Privatization Agency, 
told reporters today. 
  Sarnet hoped the factories would finally be sold with help 
from Europe, but he couldn't say what they would be producing in 
the future. 
  The Privatization Agency director said EBRD plans to help 
Estonia sell several enterprises into private hands. "The bank 
will restructure the enterprises that are to be privatized, 
change their management and find investors," Sarnet said. "The 
enterprises will then be privatized in the usual way." 
  The head of the Privatization Agency did not rule out that 
EBRD may take part in the Estonian privatization process also 
financially. He said the bank may either buy part of the shares 
in the companies that are to be sold into private hands to whet 
investors' appetite, or it may even extend credit to them. 
  Sarnet said EBRD has already earmarked a little over one 
million ECU for privatization consultations, as well as 10 
million ECU for buying shares or giving loans to privatized 
enterprises. He expressed hope that the bank will increase 
those sums.
