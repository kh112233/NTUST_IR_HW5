3 DEATHS IN APARTMENT TIED TO FURNACE FUMES 
A man, a woman and her son were found dead in an apartment, and a friend who 
turned up at the scene collapsed and died, apparently of a heart attack after 
learning of the deaths, police said Sunday. 
Police said they suspected that those in the apartment were overcome by carbon 
monoxide that leaked from a faulty furnace.
