  [Excerpt] According to a report by a Bakhtar Information 
Agency correspondent, recently (?two) people who were exchanging 
counterfeit money in a Kabul bazaar were arrested. Two thousand 
Pakistan rupees and 900 U.S. dollars were seized from them. 
  Mohammad Esmael (?Warsagi), head of the department for the 
campaign against crime, says the aforementioned men confessed 
that the bank notes were put at their disposal by Golboddin's 
party. 
  The report adds that Kabul city moneychangers are concerned 
about counterfeit U.S. dollar and Pakistani rupees and are 
taking great care when dealing with money. 
  It was reported earlier that 10 cartons of paper that are 
used in printing bank notes in Pakistan were intercepted at 
Peshawar airport and were later released when certain secret 
groups intervened. 
  Golboddin, whose propaganda concerning the printing of 
afghani bank notes did not achieve any result, resorted to 
selling men to Azerbaijan in exchange for dollars, in order to 
free himself from economic hardship. This latest action is his 
final instrument in order to accumulate wealth for himself and 
undermine the value of afghanis. 
  Under the condition where Kabul has been reconnected to one 
of the important ports of Afghanistan, and an export route 
between Afghanistan and Central Asia has been opened, the value 
of the afghani is increasing daily. [indistinct passage omitted]
