FT  13 JUL 92 / Second Baltic state to leave rouble zone
LATVIA has announced that its own rouble, which has circulated in parallel
with the Russian currency since the start of May, will become the only legal
tender from July 20.
The Baltic state will thus be the second country to leave the rouble zone,
after Estonia, which introduced its own currency, the kroon, on June 20. The
Latvian rouble will only be temporary, as Latvia still intends to introduce
its own currency, the lat, this autumn. Ukraine and Lithuania are also
expected to introduce their own currencies within the next few months.
The Bank of Latvia does not expect problems with the clearing of payments
with Russia, as an agreement was reached at the end of last week with the
Russian central bank. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting Russian prime minister,
however, said he had not been consulted about the move.
The Latvian rouble, unlike the Estonian kroon, is backed only by the
government's authority. Dubbed 'white money' by the Latvians, it will be
convertible into Russian roubles at par, though not officially into hard
currency.
Mr Einars Repse, central bank president, said Estonia's introduction of the
kroon had caused an overwhelming influx into Latvia of Russian roubles. This
had revived inflation, which had been squeezed to under 250 per cent by a
shortage of cash roubles and the freezing of Latvian bank accounts in
Moscow.
