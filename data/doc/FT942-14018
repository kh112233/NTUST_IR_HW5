FT  22 APR 94 / Falklands mine accord claimed
Mr Guido di Tella, Argentina's foreign minister, has announced that the
Falkland Islands government has accepted his proposals to clear some 30,000
mines laid by Argentine troops during the 1982 conflict with Britain.
Mr di Tella said: 'We have received communication from the islanders that
they welcome our offer. This is the first time the islanders have welcomed
anything from Argentina (since 1982).' He added that he would walk on the
minefields after they were cleared to show they were safe.
Argentina first proposed in January to pay a third party to remove mines,
since Argentines are banned from the islands. Mr di Tella said he has now
asked US army engineers to carry out the project, for which Argentina would
seek World Bank financing.
However, the Falkland Islands government said they have not reached a firm
agreement with Argentina over mine clearance.
Mr Graham Bound of the Falklands government office in London said 'no final
proposal has been put forward saying what will be done, in what time frame,
or by whom.'
A foreign office official said yesterday London has only reached a
'qualified acceptance' with Argentina.
