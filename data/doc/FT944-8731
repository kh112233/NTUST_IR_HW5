FT  18 NOV 94 / Observer: Campora tonic
Is he going or staying? Mario Campora, that is - Argentina's ambassador to
London. It seems he may have lost his job for disagreeing with his
president, Carlos Menem, over Menem's offer of cash to the Falkland Islands'
2,000 or so inhabitants to up sticks and leave.
Yesterday Campora was still following his timetable and lunched with City
bankers. Meanwhile back in Buenos Aires rumours were flying, suggesting he
was in trouble for pouring cold water on the idea. Campora suggests it's
daft to pay for something over which Argentina already claims sovereignty.
Sound reasoning.
Interestingly enough, senator Eduardo Menem, the president's brother, shares
Campora's opinions on this issue. When in London two weeks ago, Eduardo said
that offering money for the Falklands cheapens Argentina's claim.
Nevertheless, a presidential aide said yesterday - 'unofficially' - that
Campora may be packing his bags to become ambassador in Paris. Which is
hardly Tierra del Fuego, after all.
