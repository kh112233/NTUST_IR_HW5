BRIEFLY 
Helmsley Trial to Begin: Leona Helmsley, who heads a $5-billion real estate and 
hotel empire with her husband Harry, is scheduled to go on trial for tax 
evasion today. The Helmsleys are believed to be one of the wealthiest couples 
in the world with holdings that include the Empire State Building and the 
Helmsley Palace Hotel. Leona Helmsley was indicted for evading $4 million in 
income taxes by claiming personal luxuries and gifts as tax-deductible business 
expenses. She is also charged with extorting kickbacks from suppliers and 
contractors. If convicted, she faces a maximum sentence of more than 100 years 
in prison and millions of dollars in fines. Jury selection is expected to take 
a week; opening arguments are scheduled for July 5.
