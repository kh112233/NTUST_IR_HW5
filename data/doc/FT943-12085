The ever popular Desmond Morris is back again with an examination of The
Human Animal (BBC 1 at 9.30), but he seems to be repeating himself with yet
another programme about body language. We all know by now that some people
shake their head sideways to say yes and that it is very easy to insult the
Japanese. Still it is all good fun, laughing at mankind's little physical
oddities in the name of popular science.
Children of God was the religious cult best known for using sex to make
conversions. It was thought that the days of 'hookers for Jesus' were over
as the cult attempted to clean up its image and rename itself The Family.
But this expose by a former member suggests it still goes in for some very
dubious rituals in Witness (Channel 4 at 9pm).
Speaking in Tongues (BBC 2 9.25), the first of six new studio plays, has
much going for it. The producer is Simon Curtis; the writer Tony Merchant;
and the stars are Bernard Hill and Lesley Sharp. He is a redundant miner
playing the role of a 19th century workman in a theme museum; she earns
money chatting down a sex line.
