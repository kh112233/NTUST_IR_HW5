  [Text] Manaus--Federal Police [PF] seized $100,000 in 
counterfeit dollars disguised as money belts on the legs and 
around the waists of passengers Juarez de Paula Sobrinho, 37, 
and Artemio Nunes de Souza, 49, at the Eduardo Gomes 
International Airport early yesterday morning. 
  The PF made a similar seizure on the 23d of last month when 
it found $36,000 in the luggage of passenger Eldon Barreira 
Castelo Branco, 25. In both cases, the route was the same: the 
passengers had boarded a Varig flight bound for Manaus from the 
municipality of Tabatinga, Amazonas, across the border from 
Leticia, Colombia. 
  Paula Sobrinho and Nunes de Souza were approached by police 
as they were waiting for the connecting flight to Para. Giving 
an appearance of calm, they both denied carrying anything 
illegal, but upon being searched, they were found to be in 
possession of the false banknotes. The dollars had been packed 
in bundles, each containing $10,000 in $100 bills. Paula 
Sobrinho and Nuno de Souza had covered the packages with plastic 
and attached them to their bodies using adhesive tape. Upon 
being caught in the act, the passengers told Police Chief 
Claudio Rosas that the money had been acquired in Tabatinga. As 
had been true with the dollars seized from Castelo Branco on the 
23d, the PF discovered that the almost perfect banknotes were 
counterfeit only after expert analysis. 
  Police Chief Rosas said that the two passengers must belong 
to the same gang as Castelo Branco. That gang seems to be part 
of an international scheme, since there have been other seizures 
in various places around the country. According to him, the 
dollars are probably being produced in Leticia. The Federal 
Police want to conduct a joint investigation with Colombian 
police.
