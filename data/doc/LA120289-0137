CHARGES FACING BUS DRIVER IN FATAL CRASH 
The driver of a bus that was struck by a commuter train, killing two television 
executives, will face a variety of charges stemming from the accident, police 
said Friday. South San Francisco Police Chief James Datzman said the 
preliminary investigation into the Monday evening crash indicated that the bus 
driver, Paul Go Cang, 34, had marijuana on the bus and illegally held two 
driver's licenses. Cang -- who had at least three convictions over the last 17 
months for traffic violations -- was unavailable for comment. Two employees of 
ABC-TV were killed and six others including Cang were injured.
