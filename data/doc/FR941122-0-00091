 

Due to biological requirements, the wolf reintroduction program needs to be conducted in November through February,
as recommended by wolf scientists during the EIS process. The nonessential experimental population rule has been
extensively debated and thoroughly investigated during development of the EIS and draft rules. Because of the extensive
public review of the EIS, Record of Decision, and proposed rules, all being similar to this final rule, implementation
of the wolf reintroduction program should start as of the date of publication, without a 30-day waiting period. Therefore,
for good cause and in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Service has determined that the rule should become effective
immediately upon filing for public inspection.
