FT  29 OCT 94 / Islands top list of best-value schools
In education, the best value for money seems to lie offshore.
A rough analysis of the value for money which independent schools offer,
based on the FT-1,000 ranking of their A-level results published today in
the Financial Times, shows that the top two day schools in the British Isles
are both in the Channel Islands.
Guernsey Ladies' College charges Pounds 675 a term, compared with an average
for the UK of Pounds 1,372, while Victoria College, Jersey, charges Pounds
559.
Among boarding schools, the best value is St Mary's, in Shaftesbury, Dorset.
Girls' boarding schools performed well, accounting for all top four places.
But prestigious boys' schools still ranked highly, even after their fees
were taken into account, with Eton offering best value among boys' boarding
schools.
The list of day schools includes several big-city independent grammar
schools, such as Withington Girls' School, Manchester Grammar, and King
Edward VI girls' school in Birmingham.
The rankings take no account of the degree to which schools select their
entry, or of extra-curricular activities. Value-for-money rankings were
derived by dividing schools' A-level scores by their fees. This favours
selective academic schools, and those listed here do not necessarily offer
best value for children not academically gifted.
The value-for-money table is printed below. The figures in brackets are the
school's place in the FT-1,000 A-level ranking and the fees per term.
