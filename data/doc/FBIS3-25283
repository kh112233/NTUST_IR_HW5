<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Presidency in Ndjamena on 12 </F>
February] 
  [Text] A delegation led by Civil Service Minister Wadal 
Abdelkader Kamougue and accompanied by Mr. (Ali Mahamad Guem), 
diplomatic adviser to the Presidency of the Republic, will leave 
for Tripoli, Libya, on 14 February. The mission of the 
delegation is to hand over a message from President Idriss Deby 
to the Guide of the Libyan Revolution, Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi. 
  The message is apparently related to the implementation of 
the verdict of the International Court of Justice on the 
demarcation of borders between Libya and Chad. The departure of 
this delegation is more proof of the willingness of the Chadian 
Government to open a new era in relations between the two 
countries based on mutual trust and friendship. 
  Nonetheless, reliable sources report that, since the 
publishing of the verdict of the International Court, an 
important reinforcement of Libyan troops is reported in Aouzou 
and abductions are also reported of Chadians living in Libya and 
the reactivation of political groups hostile to the Chadian 
Government. This unfriendly attitude is a subject of concern 
for Chad, the communique concluded.
