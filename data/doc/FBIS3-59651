  [Text] The 21st Century Technology and Energy Committee 
(chaired by Takao Kashiwagi, professor at the Tokyo University 
of Agriculture and Technology) reports that, with the 
establishment of an optimal nuclear fuel cycle involving new 
types of reactors and the practical application of large-volume 
electric power storage technology, nuclear power will account 
for 35&percnt; of Japan's primary energy supply by 2050. 
  The objectives of that committee are to assess and predict 
the practical possibilities of future energy technologies that 
are seen as important, e.g., atomic energy, solar power, 
hydrogen power, and to get a grasp on how Japan's energy supply 
and demand will appear 60 years from now. The following is how 
the committee's report depicts Japan's energy situation in 2010. 
  "The trend toward exhaustion of petroleum resources will be 
conspicuous, prices will rise, and those resources will be 
limited to noble uses such as for the chemical industry and 
transport." 
  "There will be calls for conversion to other energy sources 
because the regulations on CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions will be 
strengthened to prevent global warming. And, CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
recovery and processing will become more practical, though the 
costs will be high." 
  "There will be more dependence on solar energy, which is a 
perpetual source of energy. Because of that, basic changes in 
urban social systems and lifestyles will be needed." 
  "The development and utilization of renewable and clean 
energies will expand globally." "As for atomic energy, an 
optimal nuclear fuel utilization cycle involving new types of 
reactors will be established." "The practical use of humanity's 
most revolutionary energies (nuclear fusion, solar power 
generation in space) will become possible." 
  As a result of those, the committee estimates that the 
primary energy supply in 2010 will consist of 15&percnt; new 
energies, 
2-3&percnt; hydro power, 1&percnt; geothermal energy, 
30-35&percnt; atomic energy, 
15-17&percnt; natural gas power, and 13&percnt; petroleum 
energy. The total 
percentage of non-fossil-fuel energies is 55&percnt;. The key to 
that, 
however, is the "technology."
