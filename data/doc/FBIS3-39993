  [Text] Brussels, Feb 24 (AFP) -- The Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO] alled on NATO Thursday [24 February] to 
extend its threat of airstrikes to other regions of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to secure a ceasefire there. 
  ICO Secretary General Hamid Algabid warned officials of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization of the "urgent necessity of 
reopening the airport at Tuzla which provides a vital route for 
the supply of humanitarian aid to the stricken populations," the 
organisation said in a statement issued here. 
  NATO has indicated that it would be "premature" to seek to 
apply the Sarajevo ultimatum -- in which besieging Serbs were 
ordered to withdraw their heavy weapons or face airstrikes -- to 
other besieged areas of Bosnia. 
  The ICO expressed its concern at the deployment of Russian 
peacekeepers in Sarajevo, the statement said. 
  It noted that the 51 member nations of the ICO were also 
willing to send troops to serve with the UN Protection Force in 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Algabid "urged NATO to maintain its pressure on the Serbs 
until they ceased their aggression and a fair peace is 
established over the whole of Bosnian territory and in the 
sub-region," the statement added.
