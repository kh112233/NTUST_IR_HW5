FT  03 SEP 94 / Part-time ruling yields first pay-offs
Nine former cleaners at Imperial Chemical Industries' plant at Wilton on
Teesside yesterday became the first beneficiaries of a House of Lords ruling
that part-time workers are eligible for redundancy pay on the same basis as
full-time employees.
The women, who lost their jobs last November, learnt yesterday that their
claim for redundancy pay two months ago had been successful. It is believed
to be the first claim of its kind since the Lords decision in March.
The women, members of the TGWU general union, were employed by Initial
Contract Services.
The industrial tribunal at Newcastle upon Tyne ruled that workers should be
paid redundancy money on a retrospective basis as the UK domestic law was
not in line with European Union legislation.
Mr Tim Bush, TGWU district officer, said: 'We have proved the principle that
part-time workers made redundant, who have completed more than two years'
employment with a company before the House of Lords decision, can claim
retrospective redundancy payments.'
Before the Lords' decision part-time workers had to work for five years
before enjoying the rights gained by full-time employees after two years.
