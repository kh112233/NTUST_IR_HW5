FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (14): Trade balance strengthens - The British
powerhouse's success is based on its ability to discover, develop and then
market highly innovative medicines. Paul Abrahams finds that export growth
has risen again this year / The pharmaceuticals industry
THE UK's pharmaceuticals industry is one of nation's crown jewels, second
only to power-generating machinery in its trade balance surplus.
Last year, the sector enjoyed a surplus of Pounds 1.329bn, more even than
the petroleum industry. In 1951, the trade surplus was only Pounds 31m.
The continuing trade balance success of the UK's drugs industry has been
based on export growth, which has risen steadily over the past decade,
increasing from Pounds 978m in 1982 to Pounds 2.993bn last year.
The leading exporter is Zeneca, the recently spun-off bioscience business of
Imperial Chemical Industries. Although this is not the largest of the UK's
bioscience companies, a substantial proportion of its manufacturing is
carried out in the UK.
Last year, the company, which sells agrochemicals and speciality chemicals
as well as medicines, generated exports of Pounds 1.4bn compared with Pounds
1.23bn the previous year.
Other leading exporters include Glaxo, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals
group, whose exports rose only 0.84 per cent from Pounds 837m in 1991 to
Pounds 844m last year as it brought overseas manufacturing of its new
products on stream.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, increased its
exports by 33 per cent from Pounds 347m in 1991 to Pounds 462m last year.
The company says this was because of the launch of its anti-depressant
Seroxat and the anti-nausea product Kytril.
The UK's pharmaceuticals export success has been generated not only by
UK-based groups but by also by highly successful British subsidiaries of
multinational corporations.
Ciba, the Swiss group, runs a large UK trade surplus with exports last year
of Pounds 294m and imports of only Pounds 79m, although not all of this is
generated by pharmaceuticals. The company is the UK's 41st largest exporter.
Another Swiss company, Roche, also runs a trade surplus with exports of
Pounds 112m compared with imports of Pounds 67m. Lilly Industries, the UK
subsidiary of Eli Lilly of the US is the UK's 78th biggest exporter, with
sales overseas of Pounds 132m compared with imports of Pounds 79m.
The basis of the UK's success has been its remarkable ability to discover,
develop and then market highly innovative medicines.
According to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, UK
groups have successfully developed 420 new chemical entities.
Two of the world's 10 top-selling drugs were developed in the UK, including
Glaxo's Zantac, the world's best-selling medicine with sales of more than
Pounds 2.1bn a year.
However, the rate of import growth is rising more rapidly than export
growth. Whereas exports exceeded imports by a factor of four in 1970, the
ratio by last year was only 1.5. Imports increased from Pounds 375m in 1982,
to Pounds 1.663bn last year. The UK runs drugs trade deficits with Germany,
Switzerland, and Sweden, for example.
The position would be worse if the UK domestic market was not so small. Its
per capita consumption of medicines was only Dollars 46 during the first six
months of the year, according to IMS, the specialist market research
company. The figure in France was double that.
One reason for the increasing penetration of non-UK medicines is that
British doctors are prescribing increasing numbers of drugs from overseas.
According to SmithKline Beecham, the third, fourth and fifth largest drugs
groups selling in the UK are Ciba, Astra of Sweden and Bayer of Germany.
Merck &amp; Co of the US and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the Franco-American group, are
seventh and eighth.
In addition, many British groups are investing in manufacturing overseas. Dr
Joe Blaker, group technical director in charge of manufacturing at Glaxo,
estimates that 10 years ago its US market was almost entirely supplied by
products originating from the UK. The company now manufactures more than
half its volume outside its home-country.
Other groups are following Glaxo's lead. SmithKline Beecham has
manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico, Singapore, Ireland and the UK.
The first three countries have all offered significant tax breaks for
pharmaceuticals manufacturing. Wellcome estimates that 65 per cent of its
active ingredients are manufactured in Britain, but only 40 per cent of its
products are finished there.
While British-based groups seem set to discover innovative products, the UK
will not entirely benefit from their success.
