SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: NATIONAL CITY 
A robbery suspect was arrested Monday after an attempt to steal a car outside a 
doughnut shop failed. 
Lt. Merrell Davis of the National City Police Department said a man armed with 
a .45-caliber handgun approached another man in the 1500 block of Highland 
Avenue about 6:15 p.m. and demanded his car keys. 
The gunman grabbed the man's keys and jumped in his car. But the would-be thief 
was unable to take the car because the steering wheel had an anti-theft device 
on it, Davis said. While the gunman was attempting to steal the car, a witness 
called National City police. 
When two officers and a police dog arrived, the thief fled. The police dog 
chased the suspect and bit him a couple of times, forcing him to drop his 
weapon, Davis said. The dog was called back by its handler and the chase 
continued several blocks toward Plaza Boulevard. Officer Lynn Martinez and 
Detective Mark Musgrove caught the man on Plaza Boulevard. Glenn James, 21, was 
arrested on suspicion of attempted auto theft, armed robbery and resisting 
arrest.
