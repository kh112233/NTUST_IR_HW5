PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: DRUG INTERACTION SHOULD BE DISCUSSED BEFORE SURGERY 
Question: Several months ago my wife ruptured a disk in her back and was in 
agony. Her doctor recommended surgery and after a second opinion, she decided 
to go ahead with it. 
Before the operation, she met with the surgeon and they reviewed all the 
medications she was taking, including an antidepressant called Parnate. In 
fact, she had to give the same information over and over again to different 
doctors. 
She scheduled the surgery and steeled herself for it. But just before they 
wheeled her into the operating room, the anesthesiologist came bustling in to 
review her chart one last time. When he saw that she was on Parnate, he called 
the operation off. 
I don't understand why somebody didn't know weeks ahead of time that she 
couldn't have surgery while she was on Parnate. They certainly knew all about 
it, so why didn't anybody tell us? 
Answer: It is shocking that such lack of communication could occur in a 
hospital, but this isn't the first time we have heard of such problems. We 
believe it is crucial that patients meet their anesthesiologist well in advance 
of surgery to discuss potential medication interactions. 
In your wife's case, blood pressure control could have been more difficult 
while she was on Parnate. 
Q. Can you tell me about Ansaid? My mother has just started taking it for 
arthritis, and now she says she is free of pain. Is this pain reliever 
addicting? 
A. Ansaid (flurbiprofen) is a relatively new arthritis medication. Like most 
other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), this type of medicine 
reduces inflammation and swelling in the joints as well as relieving pain. 
NSAIDs are not addicting, but they do have side effects, including stomach 
irritation, ulceration, diarrhea, headache, skin rash and kidney problems.
