  [Text] The privatization of large enterprises is the main 
task the Estonian Government has to cope with this year, Prime 
Minister Mart Laar said at a meeting with foreign journalists in 
Tallinn. 
  Laar described two different ways of privatization that the 
country was now going to use. First, the state companies that 
are making a negative profit will be sold by auction, like in 
the previous stages. He added that it were the prospective 
guaranteed investments by the potential buyer rather than the 
auction price itself that was decisive in deciding to whom to 
sell. 
  In the case of successful state businesses, 49 percent of 
the 
shares are to be sold to Estonian residents for their 
privatization vouchers, while 51 percent will go to investors. 
  Estonia also faces a growingly important task to increase 
the 
pace of development in the regions now remaining outside the 
active business areas, which so far mainly comprise the 
country's capital, Tallinn, and its closest surroundings. 
  Laar said changes were needed in the situation when 90 
percent of foreign investments are coming to Tallinn. 
  The prime minister also said that the period following last 
fall's local elections had provided hope for a normalization of 
the situation in the northeastern region. The former, 
confrontation-bound local government in the region earlier 
scared off potential investors from the area, but now an inflow 
of money can be expected in the large companies of the region, 
Laar said. Immediate plans include selling the Kreenholmi 
Manufaktuur textile giant in Narva to foreign investors, 
reportedly -- Swedish. 
  As the third-important task for his government, Laar 
mentioned creating a legislative basis for business development.
