 

Klamath River fall chinook ocean abundance is expected to be 137,600 age-3 and age-4 fish at the beginning of the fishing
season. This forecast is 16 percent below last year's actual abundance, and 58 percent below the average of estimates
for 19851993. The spawning escapement goal for Klamath River fall chinook is 3334 percent of the potential
adults with a minimum of 35,000 natural spawners (wild run salmon or fish that spawn independent of hatcheries). Although
ocean escapement to the Klamath River (in-river run size) in 1993 was the largest recorded since 1989, the natural
spawning escapement of 20,900 adults fell short of the goal of 38,000, set in 1993 by emergency action by the Secretary
of Commerce (Secretary), and was below the FMP's minimum natural spawner requirement of 35,000 for a fourth consecutive
year. Preseason modeling predicted that harvest regulations similar to those adopted in 1993 would result in an ocean
escapement that would not be sufficient to achieve the minimum spawning escapement floor and to provide for in-river
sport and Indian tribal fisheries in 1994. 
In recent years of low abundance, the procedures used to model the Klamath fall chinook population have consistently
overestimated stock abundance and underestimated the hatchery component of the spawning run. In 1994, the Council
implemented changes in the predictor used to forecast age-3 ocean abundance and developed a new predictor of the relative
sizes of the natural and hatchery spawning escapements. As a result, the 1994 forecast of the adult ocean population
is 11 percent smaller, and the spawning escapement (hatchery and natural) required to achieve the natural spawner
floor is 36 percent greater than would have been predicted using the previous methodology. The new predictor is considered
to reflect more accurately the actual ocean abundance and proportion of natural and hatchery stocks. 
In 1989, as authorized at 50 CFR part 661, Appendix IV.B., the Council recommended, and the Secretary approved, a change
in the Klamath River fall chinook spawning escapement rate goal from 35 percent to between 33 and 34 percent (54 FR 19800,
May 8, 1989). That change was not codified at the time. The change in the spawning escapement rate goal is herein codified
in 50 CFR part 661 Appendix IV.A as a technical amendment. 
Oregon coastal chinook stocks include south-migrating and localized stocks primarily from southern Oregon streams,
and north-migrating chinook stocks that generally originate in central and northern Oregon streams. Abundance
of south-migrating and localized stocks is expected to be low, similar to the levels observed in 1993. These stocks
are important contributors to ocean fisheries off Oregon and northern California. The generalized expectation
for north-migrating stocks is for a continuation of average to above-average abundance as observed in recent years.
These stocks contribute primarily to ocean fisheries off British Columbia and Alaska. It is expected that the aggregate
Oregon coastal chinook spawning escapement goal of 150,000 to 200,000 naturally spawning adults will be met in 1994.

Estimates of Columbia River chinook abundance vary by stock as follows: 
1. 

Upper Columbia River spring and summer chinook. 

Numbers of upriver spring chinook predicted to return to the river (49,000) in 1994 are 56 percent below the 1993 run
size of 111,500 fish, and 13 percent below the 19791984 average of 56,600 fish. The 1994 depressed stock status
reflects a substantial decline from recent improvements (19851990 and 19921993) in the status of this
stock. The 19851990 and 19921993 increases from the poor returns in the early 1980s are primarily the
result of increases of hatchery stocks. The natural stock component remains depressed. Ocean escapement is expected
to be significantly below the goal of 115,000 adults counted at Bonneville Dam. Upriver spring chinook are affected
only slightly by ocean harvests in Council area fisheries, with the contribution of these stocks being generally
1 percent or less of the total chinook catch north of Cape Falcon, OR. Expected ocean escapement of adult upriver summer
chinook is 15,700 fish. The 1994 stock status remains extremely depressed, with ocean escapement being about 20 percent
of the lower end of the spawning escapement goal range of 80,000 to 90,000 adults counted at Bonneville Dam. Upriver
summer chinook migrate to the far north and are not a major contributor to ocean fisheries off Washington and Oregon.

2. 

Willamette River Spring Chinook. 

Willamette River spring chinook returns are projected to be 72,000 fish, 15 percent above the 1993 run of 62,600 fish,
and 11 percent greater than the 19801984 average return of 65,000 fish. Willamette River spring chinook stocks
are important contributors to Council area fishery catches north of Cape Falcon. 
3. 

Columbia River Fall Chinook. 

Four distinct fall chinook stock units initially were identified, and recently a fifth stock unit has been added,
as follows: 
(a) Upriver bright fall chinook ocean escapement is expected to be 85,400 adults, 17 percent below the 1993 return
of 102,900 adults, and 7 percent above the 19811985 period of poor returns that averaged 79,500 adults. The
escapement goal for upriver bright fall chinook is 40,000 adults above McNary Dam. This stock has a northern ocean
migratory pattern and constitutes less than 10 percent of Council-area fisheries north of Cape Falcon.
