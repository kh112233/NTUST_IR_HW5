  [Text] Chongqing, March 22 (XINHUA) -- Efforts to use 
high-technology to upgrade traditional industries have begun to 
pay off in this important industrial city in southwest China's 
Sichuan Province. 
  According to local officials, high-technology has injected 
great vitality into a group of old enterprises in the city. 
These enterprises have so far produced high- and 
new-technological products with an output value of 800 million 
yuan. 
  As west China's largest old industrial base, Chongqing used 
to be hampered in its economic development because of the 
dominance of outdated technology and outmoded products. 
  To change this situation, the Science and Technology 
Committee of Chongqing city has encouraged some old enterprises 
to apply high- and new-technology for technical upgrading. 
  While importing equipment and technology from foreign 
countries and promoting the absorption of such technology, local 
enterprises have also paid great attention to the development of 
high- and new-technology, as well as to the adjustment of 
product mix. 
  For instance, the Chongqing No. 5 Pharmaceuticals Factory 
used to be able to produce only a handful of items, such as 
starch and glucose, before 1986. But over the past few years, 
factory leaders have decided to organize researchers to focus on 
the development of new types of antibiotic pharmaceuticals by 
making good use of bio- engineering techniques, and adopted a 
new principle of treating production of nutritious 
pharmaceuticals and base materials for producing antibiotic 
pharmaceuticals as the main tasks. 
  The factory, which is now an important enterprise under the 
state administration of pharmaceuticals, has developed 16 types 
of new products. 
  At the same time, the Science and Technology Committee has 
also encouraged local scientific research institutes and 
colleges to help promote the technical upgrading of enterprises 
in the city.
