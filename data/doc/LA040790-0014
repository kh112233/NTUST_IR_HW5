VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SATICOY; 
BRIDGE REPAIR WORK FINISHED WEEK EARLY 
Repair work on the California 118 bridge over the Santa Clara River in Saticoy 
has been completed a week ahead of schedule, according to Caltrans. 
Caltrans Maintenance Supt. 
Ron Cabral said work on the bridge took less time than expected because, among 
other things, "once workers opened up the bridge joints, they discovered the 
condition was not as deteriorated as anticipated." 
Even more helpful, he said, was "the excellent cooperation we had from drivers 
in the area who voluntarily took alternate routes, which significantly 
decreased the traffic on the bridge." The California Department of 
Transportation also increased the number of workers on the project, he added. 
Cabral said that even though the bridge is now in excellent condition, Caltrans 
plans to widen it in the future. The timing of that project depends on whether 
voters approve Proposition 111 on the June ballot, authorizing increases in the 
gasoline tax and spending limits, he said. JACK SEARLES
