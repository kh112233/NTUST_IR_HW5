FT  07 APR 94 / Gooda Names to face extra losses of Pounds 60m
More than 4,000 Lloyd's Names on seven loss-making Gooda Walker syndicates
will learn this week that they face additional losses of about Pounds 60m.
Gooda Names must pay the extra money to meet claims paid or notified during
1993. These stem mainly from two sources: court awards to victims of the
Lockerbie air crash in 1988 and possible future court awards to Names - the
individuals whose assets support the insurance market - who are suing their
agents for negligence.
GW Run-Off, the agency now managing the Gooda syndicates, says in a letter
to Names: 'Certain results are materially worse than the estimates referred
to in our preliminary report to Names issued in January 1994.'
Total losses of the seven syndicates now amount to Pounds 988.4m and could
eventually exceed Pounds 1.15bn. GW Run-Off indicates that claims paid last
year on business underwritten in previous years had exceeded earlier
forecasts by Pounds 63.22m. Overall, the Lloyd's market has suffered losses
of more than Pounds 7bn since 1988.
'These figures make very depressing reading for Gooda Walker Names,' said Mr
Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group. Mr Deeny said the
figures justified the group's decision to reject Lloyd's Pounds 900m
out-of-court settlement offer made in February. He said that the group would
now increase the amount it is claiming in damages to more than Pounds 600m.
The Names' legal action is due to start on April 26.
GW Run-Off will decide in the next few weeks how much cash it needs to call
from Names this year. Losses either paid or reported during 1993 total
Pounds 163.2m.
It has collected Pounds 700m of the loss so far, of which more than Pounds
500m has been paid by individual Names.
'People are staggered when they hear that figure,' said Mr Ken Randall,
chief executive of GW Run-Off. 'There is more financial resilience around
than you would expect.'
Mr Randall said that less than Pounds 150m has been paid from Lloyd's
Central fund, which meets claims when Names cannot fulfil their obligations.
Explaining the additional losses, Mr Randall said that about Pounds 25m of
the extra money was needed to pay claims arising from the Lockerbie disaster
in December 1988, when a PanAm airliner crashed with the loss of 250 lives.
Aviation insurers now have a clearer idea of how much money they must pay in
legal awards. As a result Syndicate 298, which was a player in the aviation
reinsurance market, can clarify its liabilities.
Claims have also arisen from legal action by Names against their agents at
Lloyd's. Syndicate 290 was a significant underwriter of errors-and-omissions
insurance, which covers Lloyd's agents against legal awards for negligence.
It has increased its reserves against potential claims.
Including the new loss estimates, syndicate 290's overall losses between
1989 and 1991 amount to Pounds 351.9m. Syndicate 298 faces losses of Pounds
332.5m.
