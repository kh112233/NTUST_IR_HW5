  [Text] Today, ELN [Army of National Liberation] guerrillas 
blew up a stretch of the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline near the 
municipality of Pelaya in southern Cesar Department. 
  More than 8,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into Gamboa 
ravine that flows into the Zapatosa marsh. This rich 
agricultural and cattle region is now facing an environmental 
emergency as result of actions carried out by organized criminal 
groups. Over the past two weeks, several guerrilla attacks have 
taken place in this same area and have polluted rivers and 
streams throughout the region. 
  This afternoon, ECOPETROL [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] 
technicians began implementing emergency measures to prevent the 
oil spill from spreading, reaching the marsh, and causing 
irreparable environmental damage. 
  In another attack, ELN guerrillas arrived at Villa del 
Rosario, Norte de Santander, some time after 0200 and proceeded 
to detonate explosive devices at the police department and the 
mayor's office. Several buildings near the police station, 
including the local comptroller's office, were also damaged by 
the blasts. 
  Following the attack, the ELN column proceeded to ambush a 
police patrol in Villa del Rosario, Cucuta. Three police 
officers were killed and four others seriously wounded in the 
attack.
