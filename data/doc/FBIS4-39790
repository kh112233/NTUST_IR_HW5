  [Text] Today, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk received 
Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The Vietnamese prime minister 
is 
in Kiev on an official three-day visit. 
  At the start of their conversation, the Ukrainian president 
expressed his satisfaction with the results of the meetings and 
talks with Ukraine's senior government officials and economists, 
held by the Vietnamese guest in the last two days. 
  Several important documents and agreements on wider-ranging 
cooperation between Ukraine and Vietnam were signed. The latter 
country, in particular, has an interest in our state carrying 
out the reconstruction of Vietnamese power engineering 
enterprises, and even today there are some Ukrainian specialists 
taking part in the construction of two hydroelectric stations in 
the south and north of that country. Machine building, the 
chemical and light industries are just some of the aspects of 
our mutual interest in cooperation. 
  Vo Van Kiet spoke highly of the results of his visit to 
Ukraine and expressed hope that relations between both states 
will further develop and strengthen.
