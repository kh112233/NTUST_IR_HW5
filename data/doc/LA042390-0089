IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
MEN WARNED ON NUDE SUNBATHING 
Men who frequently sunbathe nude using ultraviolet lamps substantially increase 
their risk of developing a rare and potentially fatal genital cancer, according 
to a new study published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine. The 
study shows that the penis is particularly susceptible to the carcinogenic 
effects of sunlight, and it advised men who are frequently exposed to 
ultraviolet radiation in tanning salons, on the beach, or for therapeutic 
purposes to protect themselves. 
"Occasional sun exposure carries little risk. We are talking about people who 
like to tan all over and do it year in and year out and are using a variety of 
ultraviolet light devices," said Dr. Robert Stern, a dermatologist at Harvard 
Medical School, who led the study. 
Excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation is estimated to cause some 90% of 
the 500,000 cases of skin cancer in the United States each year. 
The study reviewed a group of 892 men who, over a 12-year period, received high 
doses of ultraviolet light and chemicals called psoralens for the treatment of 
psoriasis, a commonly used therapy for severe cases of the skin disease. The 
incidence of cancer of the penis and scrotum was nearly 300 times higher in 
these men than in the general population.
