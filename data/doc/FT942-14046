FT  22 APR 94 / US aims to stop war spreading
The US yesterday proclaimed its 'strategic interest' in containing the
Bosnian war as a fresh attack on the hospital in the enclave of Gorazde
killed about 20 people.
Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, told Congress that the
United States wanted to stop conflict from reigniting in Croatia or starting
in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
'We have a strategic interest in preventing that war from spreading,' he
told Congress, voicing confidence that European allies would back the idea
of escalating air strikes when they confer in Brussels.
In the past, US officials have expressed conflicting views on whether their
country's vital interests are at stake in the Bosnian conflict.
For the second day running, Serb shells crashed into a makeshift hospital
building. A local team for Medecins Sans Frontieres put the death toll at
20, including some local doctors. However Mr Haris Silajdzic, Bosnian prime
minister, said the town's Moslem defenders faced Serb demands that they
abandon their remaining pockets of resistance on the right bank of the town,
where the hospital is located. But local radio stations said the defenders
would not surrender.
UN officials yesterday feared for 13 UN and humanitarian workers trapped in
Gorazde. 'They are unarmed civilians there on behalf of the international
community,' said Miss Lyndall Sachs, of the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees.
Angry Serb women blocked a convoy of 100 UN soldiers and 40 medical
personnel which yesterday left Sarajevo for Gorazde, where 450 people have
been killed and 1,500 injured since last month when Serb forces began their
assault.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday reiterated claims that
the city was mostly Serb.
