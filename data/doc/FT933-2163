FT  21 SEP 93 / Kohl and Ciller set up talks
GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Turkish premier Tansu Ciller yesterday
agreed to set up a committee to discuss neo-Nazi attacks and citizenship
rights for Germany's large Turkish minority.
The Turkish government is known to favour the introduction of dual
citizenship for the 1.8m Turks permanently residing in the country. But Mr
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), together with its conservative
Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union (CSU), want instead to slightly
ease access to German citizenship, which Turks can only obtain if they give
up their own passports.
Local Turkish organisations yesterday said the committee would probably do
little to help the integration of Turks who have been regular targets of
racist violence.
Ms Ciller is expected to further discuss ways in which Turks in Germany
could receive political rights as she meets Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign
minister, today and a member of the Free Democrats (FDP). The Turkish
premier is also due to meet business leaders.
