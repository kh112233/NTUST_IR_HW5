  [Text] Nicosia, April 3 (AFP) -- Gunmen shot dead an AFP 
correspondent and her bodyguard in an ambush near 
al-Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan on Sunday [3 April], UN aid 
workers said. 
  Lissy Schmidt, a 35-year-old German, was travelling by car 
with her Iraqi Kurdish bodyguard when they were attacked east of 
the city, Steven Allen of UNICEF in the northern Iraqi town of 
Irbil told AFP by telephone. 
  The ambush occurred at 1:00 p.m. (0900 GMT). 
  Schmidt was the only foreign journalist permanently based in 
Iraqi Kurdistan, which has had de facto autonomy since a Kurdish 
uprising against the Baghdad regime following the 
January-February 1991 Gulf war. 
  She worked for AFP and the German media, notably the 
Frankfurter Rundschau and Tagesspiegel newspapers.
