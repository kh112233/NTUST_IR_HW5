PROZAC IN ABBIE HOFFMAN DEATH? 
Two citizens groups today asked the Bucks County coroner to reopen an 
investigation into the death of political activist Abbie Hoffman for signs that 
he was driven to suicide by a controversial anti-depressant. 
Hoffman had taken the drug Prozac six weeks before he was found dead on April 
12, 1989, in his Solebury Township apartment, the Citizens Commission on Human 
Rights and the Prozac Survivors Support Group said in a letter to the coroner. 
Coroner Thomas Rosko's autopsy showed Hoffman, a founder of the 1960s anti-war 
Yippie movement, died from an overdose of the sedative phenobarbitol and 
alcohol. 
In their letter, the groups cite a Harvard study linking Prozac to obsessive 
suicidal thoughts. Published in the February edition of the American Journal of 
Psychiatry, the study found that 3 1/2% of Prozac users developed suicidal 
thoughts that lasted up to three months after taking the drug.
