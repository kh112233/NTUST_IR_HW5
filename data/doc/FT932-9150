FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SB forges more links in US drugs promotion
THE INCREASING trend towards co-promotional ventures between pharmaceuticals
groups continued yesterday when SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American
group, and Janssen, the drugs subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, agreed to
co-promote two of their drugs.
Under the agreement, Janssen will co-promote Paxil, SB's selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor anti-depressant in the US hospital market. In exchange,
SB will co-promote Risperdal, a novel schizophrenia drug, in the US
psychiatric market.
Paxil, launched in the US in January, is one SB's most important new
products, and competes with Eli Lilly's Prozac, and Pfizer's Zoloft.
Prozac's sales have been hit by concerns about its safety, and even before
the co-promotion deal SB's managers were convinced the group's salesforce
was far more powerful than Pfizer's. The US market is worth about Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 970m).
Risperdal was registered at the US Food and Drug Administration last year,
and was recommended by an advisory panel in April this year.
The announcement is a blow for Merck, the US group. Last year, SB agreed to
co-promote Zocor, Merck's cholesterol-lowering agent. It had been expected
Merck would co-promote Paxil.
