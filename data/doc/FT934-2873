FT  11 DEC 93 / Eurotunnel to take to the air
Eurotunnel, the operator of the channel tunnel, has been awarded a special
commercial radio licence to broadcast travel news and music along the M20
motorway in Kent.
Channel Travel Radio, funded wholly by Eurotunnel, was awarded the
restricted service licence for eight years by the Radio Authority. 'It's a
service for Eurotunnel passengers, but we are required to give information
about ferries too,' the company said yesterday.
The licence was one of four awarded yesterday by the authority. By far the
largest was a new licence for central Scotland, the last of five new
regional commercial licences to be awarded this year.
The licence went to Central Scotland Radio, a company backed by Grampian
Television. The new station, which plans to broadcast a mixture of talk and
adult contemporary music, will cover Glasgow and Edinburgh and the areas
around and between, reaching around 2.3m people. The Radio Authority also
awarded two local radio licences for Manchester. Faze FM Radio will
broadcast dance music and Fortune will offer easy listening music.
