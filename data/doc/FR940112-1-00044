<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to add 313 chemicals and chemical categories to the list of toxic chemicals required to be reported
on under section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 and section 6607 of the Pollution
Prevention Act of 1990. The proposed addition of these chemicals and chemical categories is based on their acute human
health effects, carcinogenicity or other chronic human health effects, and/or their environmental effects. EPA

I. Introduction 


A. Statutory Authority


This proposed rule is issued under sections 313(d) and (e)(1) of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know
Act of 1986 (EPCRA), 42 U.S.C. 11023. EPCRA is also referred to as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986. 


B. Background


Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain facilities manufacturing, processing, or otherwise using listed toxic chemicals
to report their environmental releases of such chemicals annually. Beginning with the 1991 reporting year, such
facilities also must report pollution prevention and recycling data for such chemicals, pursuant to section 6607
of the Pollution Prevention Act, 42 U.S.C. 13106. When enacted, section 313 established an initial list of toxic chemicals
that was comprised of more than 300 chemicals and 20 chemical categories. Section 313(d) authorizes EPA to add chemicals
to or delete chemicals from the list, and sets forth criteria for these actions. Under section 313(e), any person may
petition EPA to add chemicals to or delete chemicals from the list. EPA has added to and deleted chemicals from the original
statutory list.
EPA issued a statement of petition policy and guidance in the 

Federal Register

 of February 4, 1987 (52 FR 3479), to provide guidance regarding the recommended content and format for submitting
petitions. EPA must respond to petitions within 180 days either by initiating a rulemaking or by publishing an explanation
of why the petition is denied. On May 23, 1991 (56 FR 23703), EPA issued guidance regarding the recommended content
of petitions to delete individual members of the section 313 metal compound categories. 


II. Explanation for Expansion of the EPCRA Section 313 Chemical List 


A. General Rationale 


The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), through the public access provisions of EPCRA, has proven to be one of the most
powerful forces in empowering the Federal government, State governments, industry, environmental groups, and
the general public, to fully participate in an informed dialogue about the environmental impacts of toxic chemicals
in the United States.
A major section of EPCRA, which Congress passed in 1986, resulted in the creation of the Toxics Release Inventory.
TRI is a publicly available data base that provides quantitative information on toxic chemical releases, transfers,
recycling, and disposal. With the collection of this information for the first time in 1987, came the ability for the
public, government, and the regulated community to understand the magnitude of chemical emissions in the United
States; to compare chemical releases and transfers of chemical wastes among States, industries, facilities, and
environmental media; and perhaps most importantly, to assess the need to reduce and where possible, eliminate these
releases and transfers. TRI enables all interested in environmental progress to establish credible baselines,
to set realistic goals, and to measure progress over time, in meeting those goals. The TRI system has become a neutral
yardstick by which progress can be measured by all interested parties.
The original list of chemicals for which reporting was required consisted of 320 chemicals and chemical categories.
The list was a combination of the Maryland Chemical Inventory Report List of Toxic or Hazardous Substances and the
New Jersey Environmental Hazardous Substance List. The combination of these two lists provided a sound and logical
starting point for the national TRI program. Recognizing however that the list would need to be a dynamic one, EPCRA
specifically authorizes additions to and deletions from the list. To date, EPA has added 16 chemicals to the list and
has deleted 12 chemicals from the list.
With 5 years experience behind the program, EPA, other federal agencies, Congress, and the public have recognized
the need to expand the TRI list beyond the original chemicals and chemical categories and beyond the relatively limited
reporting universe. (Currently reporting is only required from facilities that fall within the manufacturing Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) codes 20 through 39 that meet certain thresholds).
While the data on the chemicals that are covered have allowed the public and private sectors to be informed and involved
in environmental decisionmaking as they never were before, it has become increasingly evident to those same constituents
that they have access to information on a relatively small number of important chemicals. Congress has echoed this
recognition in the Right-to-Know More bills that were put forward in the 102nd Congress. EPA and State regulatory
agencies have integrated TRI information as a critical component in their environmental decisionmaking and in many
cases are constrained by the lack of similar information on chemicals of concern not covered by the TRI. While the TRI
has been successful in focusing attention on the initial list of chemicals and in many cases fostering emissions reductions
and prevention activities, that same focus has highlighted the need to expand beyond that initial list and to include
additional chemicals that exhibit similar toxicity characteristics. This proposal is one of the first in a series
of actions that EPA plans to use to expand the coverage of the TRI. This first phase will focus on adding chemicals, followed
by a second phase that will identify additional facilities for inclusion. EPA is considering a third phase, which
would look at modification of the data elements currently required by TRI. 

In conjunction with these expansion activities EPA has been considering whether other adjustments are needed in
the scope of the TRI program. EPA received petitions from the Small Business Administration and the American Feed
Industry Association seeking an exemption for ``small sources'' (i.e, those facilities that file TRI forms with
zero or small release estimates). EPA previously put those petitions out for public comment and, on review, believes
there is substantial merit to the general concerns raised in the petitions.

The Agency's plan for proceeding on the small source issue would include the following steps. EPA is examining four
options for establishing a small release exemption from the TRI reporting obligation: Cutoffs at zero, 500 pounds,
1,000 pounds, and 5,000 pounds. EPA will provide the public with a report on these four options by the end of January.
This analysis will consider what data might not be available at both the national and community level, and the cost
savings to the government and to industry of the four exemption levels. EPA plans to hold a public meeting in February
for discussion of the report. Based on this feedback, EPA will then design a regulatory strategy that will align the
small source issue with final action on today's proposal. The Agency's objective will be to minimize unnecessary
data collection and reporting by facilities, including for the chemicals identified in today's proposal.



B. Development of the Chemical Addition Candidates


As a starting point for screening candidates for addition to the toxic chemical list under EPCRA section 313, EPA chose
to examine the lists of chemicals regulated or identified, as of concern, under various environmental statutes including:
(1) Section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as amended in 1990 (Hazardous Air Pollutants); (2) section 602(b) of the
CAA (Class II ozone depleting substances); (3) section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) (Priority Pollutant List);
(4) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Active Ingredients, including Special Review,
Canceled/Denied or Suspended, and Restricted Use Pesticides; (5) section 302 of EPCRA (Extremely Hazardous Substances);
(6) section 102 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); (7) section
3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and chemicals listed at 40 CFR 261.33(e) and (f) and Appendix
VIII; (8) section 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended; (9) certain chemicals subject to the Toxics Substance
Control Act (Existing Chemicals); and (10) the State of California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act
of 1986 (Proposition 65) (List of Chemicals Known to the State to Cause Reproductive Toxicity). 
In addition, EPA considered chemicals designated as possible, probable, or known carcinogens in the Monographs
of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the 6th Annual Report on Carcinogens of the National
Toxicology Program (NTP), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). From this initial group of substances,
EPA excluded chemicals that are already listed on section 313 or are already reportable under one of the EPCRA section
313 categories. For example, ``cyanide, total'' is listed under section 307(a) of the CWA. This listing is considered
to be a subset of the EPCRA section 313 cyanide compounds category and the hydrogen cyanide listing. EPA decided not
to propose listing these types of chemicals separately because they are already reportable under one of the existing
section 313 categories. To prioritize chemicals for possible addition to EPCRA section 313, EPA applied a human health
and ecotoxicity screen and a production volume screen, which are described below. The results of the toxicity screen
for a subset of these chemicals were presented at a public meeting on May 29, 1992 (Ref. 4). Other chemicals were also
removed from consideration for this rulemaking because they are the subjects of two recently published EPCRA petition
responses. On March 4, 1992, EPA received a petition from Governor Mario M. Cuomo of New York and the Natural Resources
Defense Council (NRDC) to add 80 chemicals and 2 chemical categories to the list of toxic chemicals under section 313
of EPCRA. All of these chemicals and chemical categories appear on the RCRA list of hazardous wastes under 40 CFR 261.33(f)
and as such are a subset of the chemicals screened by EPA. EPA responded to the petition in a proposed rulemaking on September
8, 1992 (57 FR 41020) and in a final rule adding 22 chemicals on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63500). 
On December 3, 1991, EPA received a petition from the NRDC, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund
to add hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) to the list of toxic chemicals under section 313 of EPCRA. The HCFCs are listed
under section 602(b) of the CAA as Class II ozone depleting substances and as such are a subset of the chemicals screened
by EPA. EPA responded to the petition in a proposed rulemaking on June 24, 1992 (57 FR 28159) and in a final rule adding
11 HCFCs on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63496). An additional 16 HCFCs not added to the TRI list by the November 30, 1993 final
rule are proposed for addition in this rulemaking (See Unit IV.B.135. of this preamble). 
1. 

Toxicity screen

. A toxicity screen is a limited review of readily available toxicity data (e.g., information in data bases and other
secondary sources) that is used for a preliminary categorization of a chemical during the process of selecting candidates
for possible listing under EPCRA section 313. The toxicity screen is used to identify chemicals for further consideration
and does not reflect a final determination for listing a chemical under EPCRA section 313. Such a determination can
only be made after a hazard assessment is conducted (See Unit II.B.3. of this preamble). The chemicals identified
above were screened for four general effect categories: Acute human health effects, cancer, other chronic human
health effects, and ecological effects. 
The screening criteria associated with each of the effect areas used in the toxicity screen are discussed in detail
in the 

Revised Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines for Listing Chemicals on the Toxic Release Inventory (Draft Hazard Assessment
Guidelines)

, (Ref. 6). The numerical screening values reflected in the 

Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines

 were developed to capture, in the ``sufficient for listing'' screening category, the majority of chemicals already
listed on various CERCLA and EPCRA lists, and thus known or suspected to be toxic and/or hazardous. These 

Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines

 contain guidance for both the screening and hazard assessments of chemicals and are available for review in the docket
associated with this rulemaking. This draft document was distributed at a public meeting on May 29, 1992. A final version
of these guidelines has not yet been developed. Requests for further information about these draft guidelines should
be addressed to the person identified under ``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.'' 
Based on the results of this screen, the chemicals were preliminarily placed in one of three screening categories
defined in the 

Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines

: ``sufficient;'' ``may be sufficient;'' or ``insufficient.'' EPA received comment in response to the 

Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines

 that objected to the Agency's use of the terms ``sufficient,'' ``may be sufficient,'' and ``insufficient'' as titles
for the toxicity screening categories. The commenter claimed that these terms are appropriate only for the results
of a hazard assessment. The commenter stated that these terms should not be used for screening categories because
the toxicity screen only identifies chemicals for further consideration. EPA agrees that the screening categories
only reflect a preliminary determination on each chemical, and therefore, to avoid further confusion, will refer
to the screening categories as ``high priority,'' ``medium priority,'' and ``low priority'' to reflect the difference
between a toxicity screen and a hazard assessment. These terms will be used throughout this document in reference
to the toxicity screening categories. Chemicals that were categorized as ``low priority'' during the screening
process were not considered further as candidates for addition to the EPCRA section 313 list in this rulemaking. 
2. 

Production volume screen

. EPCRA section 313(f) establishes reporting thresholds related to the amount of a chemical that is manufactured,
processed, or otherwise used. [The EPCRA section 313 manufacture (includes import) and processing thresholds are
25,000 pounds per facility per year. The otherwise use threshold is 10,000 pounds per facility per year]. EPA anticipates
that the addition of chemicals manufactured, imported, processed, or used in quantities less than the EPCRA section
313 volume thresholds would not result in the submission of TRI reports. Thus, EPA elected to initially focus its attention
on chemicals likely to yield reports. Accordingly, EPA also screened potential candidates for the likelihood of
meeting the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds. Chemicals for which there were no data to indicate that the chemical
is likely to meet or exceed the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds were not considered further as possible candidates
for addition to the section 313 list at this time. 
Production volume data on each of the chemicals were gathered primarily from two sources: (1) The TSCA Chemical Update
System (1990); and (2) the FIFRA Section 7 Tracking System. On June 12, 1986 (51 FR 21438), EPA promulgated a rule pursuant
to section 8(a) of TSCA which required manufacturers and importers to report every 4 years, subject to certain threshold
production quantities and other exclusions, the quantities of chemicals they produced (40 CFR part 710). Among the
exceptions to the inventory update rule (IUR) reporting were polymers, biological products, inorganic substances,
and chemicals produced at less than 10,000 pounds, all with certain limitations. Data from the IUR is maintained in
EPA's TSCA Chemical Update System (CUS). 
Section 7 of FIFRA provides the Agency with annual production information on registered pesticides. EPA regulations
implementing FIFRA section 7 (40 CFR part 167) require all manufacturers of pesticidal products (which includes
formulated pesticides, active ingredients, and devices) to submit an annual report detailing the amount of each
type of pesticidal product manufactured, sold and distributed during the past year, and estimated to be manufactured,
imported, and processed during the current year (40 CFR 167.85). 
For industrial inorganic compounds not subject to FIFRA or available on CUS, information from the public literature
was used, supplemented with information from companies. 
3. 

Hazard evaluation

. EPA conducted a hazard evaluation for each of the addition candidates that resulted from the above analyses and determined
based on the weight-of-the evidence if there was sufficient evidence to establish that the candidate chemical met
the statutory criteria for addition to EPCRA section 313. To make this determination, EPA senior scientists reviewed
readily available toxicity information on each chemical for each of the following effect areas: acute human health
effects; cancer; other chronic human effects; and environmental effects. In addition, EPA reviewed, where appropriate,
information on the environmental fate of the chemical. 
The hazard assessment was conducted in accordance with relevant EPA guidelines for each adverse human health or environmental
effect (e.g., the appropriate guidelines for hazard evaluation of chemical carcinogens and for the type of evidence
required to substantiate a determination of carcinogenicity are the 

Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment

 (Ref. 2)). The guidelines that were used for each effect are Agency guidelines that are identified in the 

Draft Hazard Assessment Guidelines

 (Ref. 6). During this assessment the severity and significance of the effects induced by the chemical, the dose level
causing the effect, and the quality and quantity of the available data, including the nature of the data (e.g., human
epidemiological, laboratory animal, field or workplace studies) and confidence level in the existing data base,
were all considered. Where a careful review of the scientific data for a particular chemical results in a high level
of confidence that the chemical causes an adverse effect at relatively low dose levels, EPA believes that this evidence
is sufficient for listing the chemical under section 313. On the other hand, where a review of the scientific data indicates
that the chemical will cause various adverse effects at moderate dose levels, EPA believes, based on the total weight-of-the-evidence,
that there is sufficient evidence for listing the chemical under EPCRA section 313. EPA also conducted an analysis
of exposure for each chemical or chemical category proposed for listing under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) (i.e.,
based on adverse acute human health effects), and, where appropriate, under section 313(d)(2)(C) (i.e., based on
adverse ecological effects). For chemicals listed under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A), this analysis included estimated
concentrations of the chemical at or beyond the facility site boundary through the use of estimated releases and modelling
techniques. EPA requests comment on its approach in considering exposure as a part of its evaluation of these chemicals
under sections 313(d)(2)(A) and (C).
Based on this analysis for each of the chemicals proposed for listing, EPA determined that one or more of the statutory
criteria were met. A discussion of EPA's interpretation of the EPCRA section 313 criteria is given in Unit III. of this
preamble. A discussion of the evidence supporting EPA's proposal to add each of the chemicals to EPCRA section 313
is presented in Unit IV. of this preamble and in the record supporting this proposed rule. 
4. 

Other considerations

. EPA excluded certain chemicals and chemical categories from consideration for proposed listing under EPCRA section
313 in this rulemaking for a number of reasons. Some chemicals were identified only as environmental degradation
products rather than chemicals that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used by a facility. These chemicals
will only be present in the environment as a result of the release into the environment of precursor chemicals. If the
degradation product meets the toxicity criteria of EPCRA section 313, the precursor chemical may be considered for
listing on EPCRA section 313. The degradation product would not be considered for listing on EPCRA section 313 because
a facility subject to EPCRA section 313 is only required to file a TRI report for a chemical that it manufactures, processes,
or otherwise uses, within the facility boundaries. Therefore, EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to consider
listing such chemicals at this time. 
Some of the lists reviewed by EPA included listings that represented waste streams from particular processes. These
waste streams, such as coke oven emissions, are not discrete chemicals or chemical categories, but contain a wide
range of chemicals, many of which are currently listed individually on EPCRA section 313. The focus of this rulemaking
is on the addition of specific chemicals and chemical categories and, as such, EPA believes that these waste streams
are inappropriate for listing under EPCRA section 313 at this time. EPA also excluded chemicals whose only identified
toxicity concern was a result of their status as a volatile organic compound (VOC). VOCs contribute to the formation
of tropospheric ozone which causes a number of health-related and environmental problems. EPA continues to believe
that VOCs meet the listing criteria of EPCRA section 313. However, EPA intends to address the issue of how VOCs should
be listed on EPCRA section 313 separately. Therefore, chemicals whose only identified toxicity concern is due to
their status as VOCs were excluded from consideration at this time. 
EPA also identified chemicals that are routinely manufactured, processed, or otherwise used at levels far below
the reporting thresholds of EPCRA section 313. These chemicals are not expected to ever be manufactured, processed,
or otherwise used in quantities at or above these reporting thresholds. In this proposed rulemaking, EPA is attempting
to add chemicals to EPCRA section 313 that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in quantities greater than
the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds and thus would result in the submission of TRI reports. Consequently, chemicals
that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used in quantities less than the EPCRA section 313 volume thresholds
were excluded from further consideration at this time, because no reports would be filed under EPCRA section 313 for
such chemicals. 
Some of the chemicals that are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used below the EPCRA section 313 activity thresholds,
particularly those chemicals that are manufactured in trace amounts in waste streams, are highly toxic at very low
dose levels and have physical, chemical, or biological properties that make the chemicals persist for extended periods
in the environment, and bioaccumulate through the food chain. Persistent bioaccumulative toxic chemicals, such
as dioxins, are of particular concern in ecosystems such as the Great Lakes Basin due to the long retention time of the
individual lakes and the cycling of the chemical from one component of the ecosystem to another. EPA may reconsider
in the future the issue of listing such chemicals in a manner which would result in the submission of TRI reports. EPA
requests comment on the following: Is it appropriate to list such chemicals on EPCRA section 313? If EPA were to add
this type of chemical to EPCRA section 313, what modifications to EPCRA section 313, such as lowering the reporting
thresholds and modifying the 

de minimis

 in mixture exemptions (40 CFR part 372.38), would be required to insure that release and transfer information would
be collected? 


III. EPCRA Section 313 Statutory Criteria 


EPCRA section 313(d)(2) sets out criteria for adding chemicals to the list of chemicals subject to reporting under
section 313(a). For a chemical (or category of chemicals) to be added to the EPCRA section 313(c) list of toxic chemicals,
the Administrator must determine whether, in her judgement, there is sufficient evidence to establish any one of
the following: 
(A) The chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health
effects at concentration levels that are reasonably likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries as a result of
continuous, or frequently recurring, releases. 
(B) The chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause in humans--
(i) cancer or teratogenic effects, or 
(ii) serious or irreversible--
(I) reproductive dysfunctions, 
(II) neurological disorders, 
(III) heritable genetic mutations, or 
(IV) other chronic health effects. 
(C) The chemical is known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause, because of--
(i) its toxicity, 
(ii) its toxicity and persistence in the environment, or 
(iii) its toxicity and tendency to bioaccumulate in the environment, a significant adverse effect on the environment
of sufficient seriousness, in the judgement of the Administrator, to warrant reporting under this section. To remove
a chemical from the section 313(c) list, the Administrator must determine that there is not sufficient evidence to
establish any of the criteria described above as required by EPCRA section 313(d)(3). Thus, the criteria for listing
or delisting a chemical are identical. However, whereas EPA can add a chemical if only one of the criteria is met, it
can only delete a chemical if none of the criteria are met. 
To ascertain whether there is sufficient or insufficient evidence to determine that the statutory criteria are met
for listing a chemical, EPA conducts a hazard assessment on the chemical and determines based on the weight-of-the-evidence,
whether the chemical can reasonably be anticipated to cause any of the adverse effects specified in EPCRA section
313(d)(2). The hazard analysis is described above in Unit II.B.3. of this preamble. EPA's interpretation of the specific
statutory criteria follows. 
1. 

Section 313(d)(2)(A) (acute human health effects)

. To determine whether the section 313(d)(2)(A) ``acute human health effects'' criterion is met, EPA must examine
the adverse effects associated with the chemical, the ``concentration levels'' which would cause acute human health
effects, and the likelihood of such levels existing ``beyond facility site boundaries as a result of continuous,
or frequently recurring, releases.'' Such a determination may include, among other factors, consideration of production
processes, workplace procedures, pollution controls, and the volume and pattern of production, use, and release,
as well as other chemical-specific factors. EPA believes that to make the section 313(d)(2)(A) determination it
must demonstrate that a chemical can reasonably be anticipated to be released in quantities that result in concentration
levels, or within a reasonable margin of exposure of the concentration levels, that would be expected to cause acute
human health effects beyond the facility site boundary. The margin of exposure applied is dependent upon the type
of hazard data (e.g., data in animals versus human) and the confidence in this hazard data base for acute effects (e.g.,
sufficiency of the hazard data). However, EPA is not required to make a facility-specific finding, nor is it necessary
for EPA to demonstrate that these concentration levels or effects occur at or near any particular facility (Ref. 1).
Furthermore, ``EPA may, but is not required to, conduct new studies or risk assessments or perform site-specific
analyses to establish actual ambient concentrations or to document adverse effects at any particular location''
(Ref. 1). Nor is EPA limited to considering concentration levels and potential acute human health effects at the ``fenceline.''
Rather, the phrase ``beyond facility site boundaries'' reflects Congress' recognition that the ``highest concentration
to which persons outside the site boundary may be exposed'' could occur at ``any point outside the boundaries of the
site on which the facility is located,'' including, for example, where an air emissions plume cools and settles to
the ground (Ref. 1). Therefore, EPA believes that to make a finding under EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A), the Agency may
estimate concentrations at or beyond the facility site boundary through the use of estimated releases and modelling
techniques. The term ``continuous or frequently recurring releases'' is included only to distinguish routine releases
that are a normal consequence of the operation of a facility from the episodic and accidental releases that are subject
to EPCRA section 304 (Ref. 1). As such, EPA believes that episodic and accidental releases are not pertinent in a determination
that a chemical meets the section 313(d)(2)(A) criterion. 
2. 

Section 313(d)(2)(B) (chronic human health effects)

. In contrast to the section 313(d)(2)(A) criterion, section 313(d)(2)(B) does not require consideration of either
the nature and frequency of releases or concentration levels at facility site boundaries. Rather, section 313(d)(2)(B)
is focused solely on whether the chemical is known or can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer, teratogenicity,
or other serious or irreversible chronic human health effects. Consequently, EPA believes that it is sufficient
to consider only the toxicity of the subject chemical to make the section 313(d)(2)(B) determination. 
3. 

Section 313(d)(2)(C) (environmental effects)

. The section 313(d)(2)(C) criterion requires EPA to consider a chemical's potential to cause significant adverse
effects on the environment. The statute directs EPA to base its determination on a consideration of the toxicity of
the chemical, either alone or in combination with the persistence of the chemical or the potential for the chemical
to bioaccumulate. Congress intended that EPA consider a broad range of environmental effects when making a determination
under section 313(d)(2)(C).




In determining what constitutes a significant adverse effect on the environment...the Administrator should consider
the extent to which the toxic chemical causes or can reasonably be anticipated to cause any of the following adverse
reactions, even if restricted to the immediate vicinity adjacent to the site: (1) Gradual or sudden changes in the
composition of animal life or plant life, including fungal or microbial organisms in an area. (2) Abnormal number
of deaths of organisms (e.g. fish kills). (3) Reduction of the reproductive success or the vigor of a species. (4) Reduction
in agricultural productivity, whether crops or livestock. (5) Alterations in the behavior or distribution of a species.
(6) Long lasting or irreversible contamination of components of the physical environment, especially in the case
of groundwater, and surface water and soil resources that have limited self-cleansing capability (Ref. 1). 




EPA believes that the environmental effects criterion inherently contains a limited exposure component because
of the statutory requirement for EPA to find a ``significant adverse effect on the environment of sufficient seriousness,
in the judgment of the Administrator, to warrant reporting'' under EPCRA section 313. Unlike section 313(d)(2)(B),
where EPA only has to determine whether certain kinds of effects are ``known or reasonably 
anticipated'' to occur, section 313(d)(2)(C) requires EPA to find the effect to be of sufficient seriousness to warrant
reporting, which implies the possibility that under certain circumstances, a chemical that could theoretically
cause a significant adverse effect on the environment is unlikely to cause one of a magnitude to warrant listing. 
The extent to which exposure is factored into EPA's determination depends upon the inherent toxicity of a chemical,
and a variety of other chemical-specific characteristics. EPA believes that when a chemical is inherently extremely
toxic, that is, it is toxic at very low dose levels, an exposure assessment is not necessary because even minimal releases
of such a chemical may reasonably be anticipated to result in significant adverse environmental effects. In such
cases, EPA could rely on toxicity alone under section 313(d)(2)(C)(i) as a basis for listing. 
However, for chemicals that exhibit adverse effects upon the environment solely based on toxicity at moderately
low doses, EPA believes that consideration of potential exposure is warranted because minimal releases may not result
in significant adverse effects upon the environment. These exposure considerations may include, among other factors,
pollution controls, the volume and pattern of production, use, and release, environmental fate, as well as other
chemical-specific factors, and the use of estimated releases and modelling techniques. 
EPCRA sections 313(d)(2)(C)(ii) and (iii) allow EPA to consider the impacts of other characteristics of a chemical.
Where a chemical exhibits significant adverse effects in the environment based on toxicity and persistence or toxicity
and bioaccumulation at very low to moderately low dose levels, EPA believes that exposure considerations are not
required in addition to those considerations implicit in evaluation of the chemical's potential for persistence
and bioaccumulation. This is because even minimal releases of the chemical may result in elevated concentrations
in the environment or in an organism that can reasonably be anticipated to result in significant adverse effects.
This reflects the increased likelihood that there will be exposure to a chemical that persists due to its longer residence
time in the environment. Repeated minimal releases of a persistent chemical may result in elevated concentrations
in the environment. For a chemical that bioaccumulates, even low levels of the chemical in the environment may result
in increased concentrations in an organism. Therefore, evaluation of a chemical's persistence or bioaccumulation
potential may be considered the functional equivalent of an exposure analysis. 
In addition, for chemicals which induce well-established adverse effects, e.g. chlorofluorocarbons, which cause
stratospheric ozone depletion, EPA believes that an exposure assessment is unnecessary. EPA believes that these
chemicals typically do not affect solely one or two species but rather affect changes across a whole ecosystem. EPA
believes that these effects are of sufficient seriousness that additional exposure considerations are not warranted
because of the scope of their impact and the well-documented evidence supporting the adverse effects. EPA requests
comment on its approach for considering exposure as a part of its evaluation for listing of these chemicals under section
313(d)(2)(C).
In Unit IV.B. of this preamble, EPA identifies each of the chemicals proposed for addition to EPCRA section 313 and
the specific statutory criteria upon which the proposed addition is based. 


IV. EPA's Technical Review 


A. Introduction 


Data on the chemicals and chemical categories were reviewed for evidence indicating adverse acute and chronic toxicity,
carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, developmental and reproductive effects, neurotoxicity, and environmental effects.
Information on the environmental fate was also reviewed. 
For each chemical proposed for addition to EPCRA section 313 in this rulemaking, EPA conducted an extensive hazard
assessment, and, where appropriate, an analysis of exposure, to determine whether the chemical met one or more of
the EPCRA section 313(d)(2) listing criteria. This hazard assessment is discussed in detail in Unit II.B.3 of this
preamble. Only after this careful review was a final determination made as to whether one of the EPCRA section 313(d)(2)
listing criteria was met for each individual chemical or chemical category proposed for listing below. EPA need only
show that one of the listing criteria is met in order to list a chemical or chemical category under EPCRA section 313.
The information summarized below for each chemical or chemical category represents the key data elements that lead
EPA to believe that there is sufficient evidence to establish that one of the section 313(d)(2) listing criteria is
met. A more extensive review of the existing data base for each chemical or chemical category proposed for listing,
which reflects the entire weight-of-the-evidence considered by EPA, is contained in following support documents:

B. Chemicals Proposed for Addition to EPCRA Section 313 


1. 

Abamectin (avermectin B1)

 (CAS No. 071751-41-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). This compound induces developmental toxicity in several species with
the mouse being the most sensitive species. Increased retinal folds in weanlings, decreased viability and lactation
indices, and decreased body weight were noted in a two-generation rat reproduction study. The lowest-observed-effect
level (LOEL) was 0.4 milligram per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) and the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was 0.12
mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived a reference dose (RfD) of 0.0004 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing abamectin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
developmental toxicity data. 

Aquatic acute toxicity values for abamectin include a bluegill 96hour LC

50

 of 9.6 parts per billion (ppb), a rainbow trout 96hour LC

50

 of 3.6 ppb, and a daphnid 48hour LC

50

 of 0.34 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing abamectin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data. 
2. 

Acephate (acetylphosphoramidothioic acid O,S-dimethyl ester)

 (CAS No. 030560-19-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 28month feeding study in rats, inhibition of brain, plasma,
and red blood cell cholinesterase activities was observed at 50 parts per million (ppm) (2.5 mg/kg/day). The NOEL
for this study was 5 ppm (0.25 mg/kg/day). Similar findings were noted in a 2year feeding study in dogs. The LOEL
for this study was 100 ppm (2.5 mg/kg/day) and the NOEL was 30 ppm (0.75 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing acephate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
neurotoxicity data for this chemical. 
3. 

Acifluorfen sodium salt (5-(2-chloro-4-(triflouromethyl)phenoxy)-2-nitro-benzoic acid, sodium salt)

 (CAS No. 062476-59-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Acifluorfen is classified as a Group B2 compound, i.e., the chemical is
a probable human carcinogen. Acifluorfen produced an increased incidence of combined malignant and benign liver
tumors in two different strains of mice. The compound also displayed positive mutagenic activity in several non-mammalian
test systems, and is structurally similar to four other diphenyl ether herbicide compounds which caused increased
incidences of liver tumors in two different strains of mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
acifluorfen sodium salt on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity
data. 
4. 

Alachlor

 (CAS No. 015972-60-8) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Alachlor is an aniline-type herbicide. Dose-related hemolytic anemia
with reductions in red blood cell counts, hematocrit and hemoglobin, as well as hemosiderosis in the liver, spleen
and kidney occurred in male dogs orally exposed to alachlor for 1year. The LOEL based on these effects was 3.0
mg/kg/day, and the NOEL was 1.0 mg/kg/day. Effects in female dogs in the same study were not demonstrated as clearly
as in males but were considered suggestive of anemia. EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day from this study. 
In a three-generation reproduction study in rats, chronic nephritis and increased relative and absolute kidney
weights were reported in F

2

 adult males and F

3

 pups. The LOEL was 10 mg/kg/day, and the NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day. Rabbits (Dutch Belted strain) that received alachlor
via oral gavage during gestation days 6 to 27 had an increased rate of preimplantation loss (49 percent) and offspring
with increased incidences of developmental malformations including major vessel variations, presacral vertebrae,
and rudimentary and full 13th ribs. The increased incidence of rudimentary and full 13th ribs was dose-related, and
a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) of 10 mg/kg/day was determined based on this effect. The no-observed-adverse
effect level (NOAEL) was not determined. 
EPA has classified alachlor as a category Group B2 compound, i.e., the chemical is a probable human carcinogen. In
a 2year rat feeding study with Long-Evans rats, there were increased incidences of nasal turbinate tumors,
malignant stomach tumors and thyroid follicular adenomas and carcinomas in both sexes at doses greater than or equal
to 42 mg/kg/day. In an 18month study in female CD-1 mice, bronchiolar tumors occurred at an increased incidence
at 200 mg/kg/day. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing alachlor on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity data for this chemical. 
5. 

Aldicarb

 (CAS No. 000116-06-3) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Aquatic acute toxicity test data for
aldicarb include a measured 96hour LC

50

 of 50 ppb for bluegill and a measured 48hour LC

50

 of 70 ppb for daphnid. In addition, the measured 48hour EC

50

 for daphnid is 51 ppb. Measured terrestrial acute toxicity data for wildlife include an oral LD

50

 for female mallard ducks of 3.4 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) and an oral LD

50

 for California quail of 2.58 mg/kg in males and 4.67 mg/kg in females. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing aldicarb on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity
data for this chemical. 
6. 

d-trans-Allethrin [d-trans-Chrysanthemic acid of dallethrone]

 (CAS No. 028057-48-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Centrilobular hydropic degeneration of the liver (LOEL was 1,000 ppm or
25 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 200 ppm or 5 mg/kg/day) was seen in dogs fed allethrin for 3 months. Increases in serum liver
enzymes in female rats and increased liver weights in male and female rats (the LOEL was 250 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was
1,500 ppm or 75 mg/kg/day) were observed in rats fed allethrin for 3 months. Histopathology data were not presented
in this study. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate hepatotoxic potential for d-trans-allethrin.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing d-trans-allethrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data. 
7. 

Allylamine

 (CAS No. 000107-11-9) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Repeated inhalation exposure to 5 ppm (0.011 mg/L) allylamine for 50 exposures
of 7 hours caused liver and renal damage and myocarditis in rats. Congestion of the liver and kidney was observed in
rats, rabbits, and dogs exposed to 5 or 20 ppm (0.011 or 0.044 milligram per liter (mg/L)) allylamine for 8 hours/day,
5 days/week, for 1year. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing allylamine on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity data for this chemical.

8. 

Aluminum phosphide

 (CAS No. 020859-73-8) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). The median lethal dose of aluminum phosphide
in humans is 20 mg/kg. The acute inhalation toxicity of aluminum phosphide is attributed to phosphine gas resulting
from decomposition of aluminum phosphide on contact with moisture in the air. Symptoms of phosphine poisoning include
restlessness, headache, dizziness, fatigue, chest tightness, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, stupor, coma, convulsions,
lowered blood pressure, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure; disorders of the kidney, liver, heart and brain
can also occur. In female CFT-Wistar rats exposed to phosphine gas generated from aluminum phosphide pellets in distilled
water, 100 percent mortality was observed after a 6hour exposure to 40 ppm (0.1 mg/L), and exposure to 20 to 40
ppm (0.05 to 0.1 mg/L) for 6 hours resulted in 33 percent mortality. Symptoms of toxicity reported in these animals
included dyspnea, loss of muscular coordination, polyuria, and paralysis.

based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
10. 

Amitraz

 (CAS No. 033089-61-1) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Amitraz is an aniline-type insecticide. In a 2year beagle dog feeding
study, effects noted at the LOAEL dose (1.0 mg/kg/day) at various times during the study included significantly increased
mean blood glucose concentration, slight hypothermia, and slight central nervous system depression (the latter
effect occurred immediately after dosing on days 1 and 2). The NOAEL in this study was 0.25 mg/kg/day and the oral RfD
derived from the NOAEL was 0.0025 mg/kg/day. These findings were supported by similar results obtained in a 90day
feeding study in dogs. In studies with rats or mice exposed to amitraz from 90 days to 2 years, LOAELs less than or equal
to 12 mg/kg/day were derived based on effects that included decreased body weight gain and changes in organ (brain
or heart) weight (the NOELs were less than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day). 
A three-generation reproduction study in rats demonstrated decreased litter size and increased mortality during
suckling. The fetotoxic LOAEL in this study was 5 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 1.6 mg/kg/day. In a teratology study in
rabbits, a fetotoxicity LOAEL of 5 mg/kg/day and NOAEL of 1 mg/kg/day were based on the incidences of cleft palate and
meningocoele associated with small ears and displaced toes. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing amitraz on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic toxicity and developmental toxicity data for this chemical.

Anilazine (4,6-dichloro-N-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine)

 (CAS No. 000101-05-3) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). When anilazine was administered to rats, maternal reproductive parameters
were not affected. The systemic maternal NOEL was 150 mg/kg and the LOEL was 500 mg/kg, based on decreased body weight
gain. The developmental NOEL was 1,500 mg/kg, which was the highest dose tested. In rabbits, the maternal toxicity
NOEL was 15 mg/kg and the LOEL was 40 mg/kg, based on increased mortalities and decreased body weight gain (also decreased
percentage of pregnant does at 75 mg/kg). The developmental NOEL was 40 mg/kg and the LOEL was 75 mg/kg, based on increased
fetal mortality, decreased fetal weight, and increased postimplantation loss and inhibited ossification (phalanges).
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing anilazine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data.

Benomyl

 (CAS No. 017804-35-2) (CAL; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). In a three-generation study in rats, a dietary level of 25 mg/kg/day
of benomyl resulted in decreased weanling weights. The no-effect level was 5 mg/kg/day. Microphthalmia (the LOEL
was 62.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day) was reported in a rat developmental toxicity study. Decreased fetal
weight (the LOEL was 62.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day) was observed in another rat developmental toxicity
study. The developmental effects were observed at doses that were not toxic to the maternal animal. Anomalies consisting
of supra occipital scars, subnormal vertebral centrum, supernumary ribs, and cleft palate were reported in an oral
developmental toxicity study in mice (the LOEL was 100 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 50 mg/kg/day). An increase in the incidence
of anomalies including encephalocele, hydrocephalus, microphthalmia, and anophthalmia was noted following administration
of benomyl to rats by intubation during the first 20 days of pregnancy at doses of 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg. The developmental
effects were always associated with death and were considered to be the cause of death. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing benomyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental
toxicity data for this chemical.

18. 

Bis(tributyltin) oxide

 (CAS No. 000056-35-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Adverse effects on the immune system were reported in rats exposed to various
doses of bis(tributyltin) oxide for a duration as short as 4 weeks. SPF-derived Wistar rats were fed the compound for
17 months. In this study, a LOEL of 0.25 mg/kg/day and a NOEL of 0.025 mg/kg/day were based on immunotoxicity manifested
as decreased resistance to 

Trichinella spiralis

, reduced natural killer (NK) cell activity in the spleen and reduced macrophage function. The RfD derived from this
NOEL was 0.00003 mg/kg/day. Similar immunological effects were reported in 4- and 6-week rat feeding studies with
20 and 80 ppm (1 and 4 mg/kg/day; the LOEL was 1 mg/kg/day). 
In rats that received dietary levels (of a range of doses that included 50 mg/kg/day) for 106 weeks, kidney function
was decreased and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase
were increased. At the end of the 2year study, nephrosis and vacuolization and pigmentation of the proximal
tubular epithelium were reported in animals administered 50 mg/kg/day. On the basis of marginal effects at 5 mg/kg/day
(LOEL), a NOEL of 0.5 mg/kg/day was established.

19. 

Boron trichloride

 (CAS No. 010294-34-5) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Boron trichloride is corrosive to the skin and mucosal tissue due to its
rapid hydrolysis to hydrochloric acid and boric acid, the former acid being the corrosive species. Single, relatively
large doses of boron administered through any route affects the central nervous system causing depressed circulation,
diarrhea, vomiting, shock, and coma. The kidneys are the most severely affected organ. Symptoms of acute irritation
of the upper airways were observed in humans at exposure levels of greater than or equal to 0.004 mg/L. Inhalation of
0.48 mg/L of boron trichloride proved fatal to certain laboratory animals. Inhalation of 0.096 mg/L of boron trichloride
for 7 hours produced adverse effects on the respiratory tract, and weight loss. 
EPA's exposure analysis indicates that boron trichloride concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site
boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated
to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
boron trichloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity
and exposure data for this chemical. 
20. 

Boron trifluoride

 (CAS No. 007637-07-2) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Boron trifluoride is a colorless gas that is corrosive to tissues due to
its rapid hydrolysis to hydrofluoric acid and boric acid. The principal acute effect in animals is irritation of the
mucous membranes of the respiratory tract and eyes; post mortem examination also revealed pneumonia and degenerative
changes in renal tubules. The kidneys are most severely affected because boric acid concentrates in this organ. Exposure
of six animal species to 0.28 mg/L of boron trifluoride for 4 to 7 hours a day, 5 days a week killed all animals within 30
days. Rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs were exposed to boron trifluoride via inhalation. Guinea pigs died of respiratory
failure after being exposed to 0.036 mg/L for 19 days; rats experienced fluorosis of the teeth at this concentration.
All three species were minimally affected at 0.004 mg/L. In a 2-week rat inhalation study, all animals died after 6
daily exposures to 0.18 mg/L. Rats exposed to 0.024 mg/L showed signs of respiratory irritation, increased lung weights,
and depressed liver weights. Rats exposed to 0.17 mg/L of boron trifluoride 6 hours/day, 5 days a week for 13 weeks developed
necrosis of the proximal tubular epithelium of the kidneys. Guinea pigs exposed to 0.035 mg/L, 7 hours/day, 5 days
a week for 3 months developed severe pneumonitis and pulmonary changes indicating chemical irritation. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing boron trifluoride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for this chemical.

(250 mg/kg/day) bromacil for 90 days. In a 2year dietary study, thyroid hyperplasia was seen in female rats
fed 1,250 ppm (62.5 mg/kg/day). Thyroid follicular adenoma was observed in one female. EPA believes that there is
sufficient evidence for listing bromacil on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the
available thyroid toxicity data for this chemical. 
22. 

Bromacil lithium salt (2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione, 5-bromo-6-methyl-3-(1-methylpropyl), lithium salt)

 (CAS No. 05340419-6) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Bromacil lithium salt will dissociate into bromacil, which is soluble in
aqueous systems and lithium ion. Defects of the palate, eye, and external ear were reported in the offspring of rats
administered 50 mg lithium chloride intraperitoneally on gestation days 1, 4, 7, and 9 followed by 20 mg/day until
day 17. Cleft palates were also observed in mouse fetuses when mothers were gavaged with 300 to 465 mg/kg/day lithium
carbonate on gestation day 6 to 15. An increase in Ebstein's anomaly was reported among offspring of women taking lithium;
cardiovascular defects were found in 212 offspring exposed in utero to lithium therapy. Increased thyroid activity
was seen in male and female rats fed 5,000 ppm (250 mg/kg/day) bromacil for 90 days. In a 2year dietary study,
thyroid hyperplasia was seen in female rats fed 1,250 ppm (62.5 mg/kg/day). Thyroid follicular adenoma was observed
in one female. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bromacil lithium salt on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental and thyroid toxicity data. 
23. 

Bromine

 (CAS No. 007726-95-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Rats fed bromine at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg/day for 6 months experienced changes
in their reflexes and blood indexes. Rats, mice, and rabbits inhaling 0.001 mg/kg/day for 4 months developed functional
abnormalities of the respiratory, nervous, and endocrine systems. Data on the acute and chronic effects of bromine
in humans are limited. Bromine is very corrosive to the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes in either the liquid or vapor
form. A concentration of 10 ppm of bromine in air is intolerable in humans, and can cause severe irritation of the upper
respiratory tract. Other clinical symptoms include neurologic, dermatologic, and gastrointestinal effects.
The maximum concentration allowable in humans for a 0.5 to 1-hour exposure to bromine is 4 ppm. Bromine can cause lacrimation
at concentrations less than 1 ppm. Chronic exposure to bromine (estimated concentration at 0.6 ppm) can result in
eye irritation, upper respiratory irritation, coughing, and headache. Neurological symptoms have also been reported
following chronic exposure to bromine. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing bromine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for this chemical. 
24. 

1-Bromo-1-(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanedicarbonitrile

and 3,000 ppm (4, 25, and 150 mg/kg/day) 1-bromo-1-(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanedicarbonitrile, a NOEL of 83.5 ppm
(4 mg/kg/day) and a LOEL of 500 ppm (25 mg/kg/day) were established (based on neonatal splenic hematopoiesis, decreased
parental body weight and food consumption, increased male urinary epithelial cells, amorphous casts, and crystals).
At 3,000 ppm (150 mg/kg/day) there was decreased lactase dehydrogenase, increased total cholesterol, total protein,
and albumin, elevated female organ-to-body weight ratio for thyroid, liver, spleen, ovaries, and pituitary. In
a 13-week dietary study in beagle dogs (administered 167, 1,000, and 4,000 ppm; 4, 25, and 100 mg/kg/day) the LOEL was
greater than 167 ppm (4 mg/kg/day) (increased male thyroid and female ovary organ to body weight ratio). At 1,000 ppm
(25 mg/kg/day), the same signs were seen as at 167 ppm (4 mg/kg/day), plus diarrhea and increased organ to body weight
ratio of thyroid, heart, liver, and adrenals. At 4,000 ppm (100 mg/kg/day), emesis and ataxia in males, decreased
body weight gain/food consumption, decreased hematocrit, hemoglobin, immature red blood cells, and alkaline phosphatase,
extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen, thyroid enlargement with follicular cell hyperplasia, increased
organ to body weight ratios for thyroid, adrenals, liver and spleen were seen. In a 13week dietary study where
beagle dogs were administered 167 ppm (4 mg/kg/day), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)-stimulated T3 and T4 increased
in both sexes. Thyroids were enlarged (both sexes) with absolute weights and organ to body weight ratios increased
in females.

in the oral cavity. The exposure concentrations in this study ranged from 70 to 300 ppm (9.8 to 42 mg/kg/day) for males
and from 150 to 600 ppm (21 to 84 mg/kg/day) for females. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
C.I. Acid Red 114 on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for
this chemical. 
32. 

C.I. Direct Blue 218

 (CAS No. 028407-37-6) (NTP) (Ref. 8). In an NTP bioassay, there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity of C.I. Direct
Blue 218 in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on significantly increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and
carcinomas. In a 2year NTP feeding study in rats, there was some evidence of carcinogenicity in male F344 rats
based on a significant increase in the incidence of squamous cell papillomas of the pharynx in the high dose group (500
mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing C.I. Direct Blue 218 on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for this chemical. 
33. 

Calcium hypochlorite

 (CAS No. 007778-54-3) (CERCLA) (Ref. 8). Aquatic acute toxicity data for calcium hypochlorite include a 96hour
measured LC

50

 for rainbow trout of 60 ppb and a 96hour measured LC

50

 for the Atlantic silverside of 37 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing calcium hypochlorite
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available ecotoxicity data for this chemical.

34. 

Caprolactam

 (CAS No. 000105-60-2) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Rats were administered caprolactam by oral gavage at doses of 0, 100, 500,
and 1,000 mg/kg/day on gestation days 6 through 20. This resulted in a LOAEL of 1,000 mg/kg/day and a NOAEL of 500 mg/kg/day
for fetal resorption. Rabbits were administered caprolactam by oral gavage at doses of 0, 50, 150, and 250 mg/kg/day
on gestation days 6 through 28. This resulted in a LOAEL of 150 mg/kg/day for maternal and fetal body weight depression.
In addition, a slight increase in the severity of spontaneous nephropathy (10,000 ppm) was observed in male rats of
the first parental generation fed 10,000 ppm of caprolactam in a three-generation reproductive study, resulting
in a NOAEL of 1,000 ppm (50 mg/kg/day). Mean body weights and food consumption were reduced in both parental generations
at 5,000 and 10,000 ppm. Body weights of offspring were also reduced at these dietary concentrations (the LOAEL was
250 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing caprolactam on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
35. 

Carbofuran

 (CAS No. 001563-66-2) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Aquatic acute toxicity test data for carbofuran include
a measured 96hour LC

50

 for bluegill of 80 ppb. In addition, the measured 48hour EC

50

 for daphnids is 35 ppb. Measured terrestrial acute toxicity data for wildlife include an oral LD

50

 for mallard ducks of 0.397 mg/kg for females and 0.480 mg/kg for males and an oral LD

50

 for female ring-necked pheasants of 4.15 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing carbofuran
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.

36. 

Carbon monoxide

 (CAS No. 000630-08-0) (CAL) (Ref. 8). Cardiovascular (e.g., electrocardiograph changes, atrial fibrillation,
ventricular arrhythmias) and neurological (e.g., headache, dizziness, convulsions, and coma) effects were reported
in humans exposed to carbon monoxide. In humans, histological effects in the brain include extensive demyelination
of white matter, and necrosis. Neuropsychiatric disorders have also been reported. Persistant electrocardiograph
changes, and degeneration of myocardial muscle fibers, hemorrhage and necrosis were observed following inhalation
exposure of dogs to 100 ppm (0.11 mg/L) carbon monoxide, 5.5 hours/day, 6 days/week, for 11 weeks. Some of the dogs showed
disturbances in gait and in postural and position reflexes. The toxicity of carbon monoxide results from its combination
with hemoglobin in the blood to form carboxyhemoglobin which is a poor oxygen carrier. Thus, oxygen delivery by the
blood is severely compromised, which leads to tissue hypoxia and possibly tissue poisoning, resulting in the toxic
effects (including death) known for this substance. Infants born to women who survive acute exposure to high concentrations
of carbon monoxide during pregnancy often display neurological sequelae and gross brain damage. Exposure of pregnant
rats to 150 ppm (0.17 mg/L) carbon monoxide caused reduced pup growth rate, and altered behavior (poor performance
on negative geotaxis and homing tests) in pups. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing carbon monoxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic neurological, myocardial, and developmental toxicity data
for this chemical. 

Carbon monoxide is regulated under Title I of the CAA (Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance of National Ambient
Air Quality Standards). In addition to this proposal to add carbon monoxide to EPCRA section 313, in Units IV.B.179.
and 235, EPA is proposing to add two other chemicals, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, that are regulated under
Title I of the CAA. Sulfur dioxide is also regulated under Title IV of the CAA (Acid Deposition Control). Extensive
data, which are highly technical, are collected on these chemicals as required by the CAA. EPA requests comment on
the following: (1) Is the information collected under the CAA sufficient for public right-to-know purposes; and
(2) suggestions on how the data collected on these chemicals pursuant to CAA Titles I and IV could be used to meet the
purposes of EPCRA section 313.

37. 

Carboxin (5,6-dihydro-2-methyl-N-phenyl-1,4-oxathiin-3-carboxamide)

 (CAS No. 005234-68-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Decreased body weight gain and food consumption, increased mortality,
and reduced kidney, heart and spleen weights were observed in rats fed 600 ppm (30 mg/kg/day) carboxin for 2 years.
The NOEL is 200 ppm (10 mg/kg/day). A similar NOEL was established in a three-generation rat reproduction study. Based
on the NOEL, EPA established an oral RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day. In a 90day feeding study in rats, degeneration of
the kidneys was seen at 600 ppm (30 mg/kg/day). The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing carboxin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available renal toxicity
data for this chemical. 
38. 

Chinomethionat (6-methyl-1,3-dithiolo[4,5-b]quinoxalin-2-one)

 (CAS No. 002439-01-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Increases in liver weight, liver protein, and both total liver and microsomal
RNA levels, as well as inhibition of mixed-function oxidase enzymes (e.g., N-demethylase, cytochrome P-450) were
noted in rats administered 75 mg/kg/day by oral gavage for 4 days or in female rats administered 75 mg/kg/day in their
diet for 21 days. Liver enlargement was reported in rats fed 10 mg/kg/day in their diet for 35 days. The increase in liver
size was attributed to increased cellular protein and an increase in water content. Rats exposed orally to 2,700 mg/kg
for 90 days (30 mg/kg/day) had changes in liver weight and effects on the hepatic microsomal oxidases as well as weight
loss or decreased body weight gain. In a 1-year dog study, the NOEL was established at 0.6 mg/kg/day for the test material
in the diet. The LOEL was 1.9 mg/kg/day as indicated by extra medullary hematopoietic nodules in the liver. 
In a developmental toxicity study in rats, increased resorption and decreased fetal weight were reported at 37.5
mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested). The NOEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day. In another developmental study in rats given 30
mg/kg/day in carboxy methyl cellulose by gavage from gestation day 6 to 20, cleft palate, anasarca and micrognathia
was observed. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing chinomethionat on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and developmental toxicity data. 
39. 

Chlorendic acid

 (CAS No. 000115-28-6) (NTP) (Ref. 8). Based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in animals IARC classified
chlorendic acid as a Group 2B compound; i.e., it is possibly carcinogenic in humans. In an NTP bioassay, there was clear
evidence of liver carcinogenicity in both rats and mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
chlorendic acid on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for
this chemical. 
40. 

Chlorimuron ethyl (ethyl-2-[[[(4-chloro-6-methoxyprimidin-2-yl)-carbonyl]-amino]sulfonyl]benzoate)

 (CAS No. 090982-32-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 1year dog study, dietary administration of 37.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL)
produced an increase in white blood cells in both sexes, a decrease in red blood cells, hematocrit, and hemoglobin
in females, and an increase in alkaline phosphatase in males. The NOEL was 6.25 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL, an oral
RfD of 0.02 mg/kg/day was derived. This study was given a high confidence rating. In a 2year rat feeding study,
changes in hematology parameters were observed at the LOEL of 125 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day. In an 18month
mouse feeding study, centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed at 90 days at 187.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL).
The NOEL was 18.75 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing chlorimuron ethyl on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological toxicity data. 
41. 

Chlorinated paraffins category

 (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Chlorinated paraffins are defined as mixtures of linear saturated chlorinated hydrocarbons
obtained through the partial chlorination of paraffin, olefin, or acetylene feedstocks which have an average chain
length of 10 to 30 carbon atoms and contain average chlorine levels ranging from 40 to 70 percent by weight. Chlorinated
paraffins can be described by the general formula: C

x

H

2x-y+2

Cl

y

 where x ranges from 10 to 30 and y ranges from 3 to 26. Both 58 percent-chlorinated, short-chain (10 to 12 carbons) and
43 percent-chlorinated, long-chain (22 to 26 carbons) chlorinated paraffins were tested in rats and mice by gavage
in a 2year bioassay. The 58 percent-chlorinated, short-chain (10 to 12 carbons) chlorinated paraffins were
carcinogenic in rats and mice: dosed male and female mice showed increased incidences of liver tumors, dosed male
rats had increased incidences of kidney tubular cell hyperplasia and adenomas or adenocarcinomas (combined), and
dosed female rats and mice showed increased thyroid gland follicular cell neoplasms, indicating an EPA Group B2 classification,
i.e., a probable human carcinogen. The 43 percent-chlorinated, long-chain (22 to 26 carbons) chlorinated paraffins
were carcinogenic in male mice showing an increased incidence of malignant lymphomas, and marginal increase in hepatocellular
neoplasms in female mice and adrenal gland pheochromocytomas in female rats, indicating an EPA Group B2 category
classification, i.e., the chemical is a probable human carcinogen. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing chlorinated paraffins on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
carcinogenicity data for these chemicals. 
The following ecotoxicity data (LC

50

s followed by experiment duration in parenthesis) have been reported for short chain (10 to 13 carbons) and intermediate
chlorination (59 percent chlorine) chlorinated paraffins: daphnid, 46 ppb (48hour); mysid shrimp, 14 ppb
(96hour); marine algae, 42 ppb (96hour); daphnid, 2 ppb and 9 ppb (21day chronic study); and midge,
78 ppb (49day chronic study). Ranges of chronic toxicity values are as follow: Freshwater invertebrates,
2 to 162 ppb; freshwater fish, 3 to 17.2 ppb; marine invertebrates, 2.4 to 24 ppb; and marine fish, 2.4 ppb to 620.5 ppm.
Chlorinated paraffins are persistent with a half-life of greater than 30 days in the environment. EPA believes that
there is sufficient evidence for listing the category chlorinated paraffins on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available ecotoxicity data for these chemicals and their persistence in the environment.

EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report if filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. 
42.

 (CAS No. 004080-31-3) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Decrease in heart weight, obliterative vasculitis, and perivasculitis
of the hepatic blood vessels were observed in dogs orally administered 1-(3-chloroallyl)-3,5,7-triaza-1-azoniaadamantane
for 90 days. The NOEL was 7.5 mg/kg/day; the LOEL was 15 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for
listing 1-(3-chloroallyl)-3,5,7-triaza-1-azoniaadamantane chloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for 1-(3-chloroallyl)-3,5,7-triaza-1-azoniaadamantane.

43. 

p-Chloroaniline

 (CAS No. 000106-47-8) (CERCLA; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). In a 78week study in which rats were fed p-chloroaniline,
non-neoplastic proliferative lesions of the splenic capsule (focal fibrosis with subcapsular mesenchymal proliferation)
were observed. The LOAEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day (the lowest dose tested) and the RfD derived from this data is 0.004 mg/kg/day.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing p-chloroaniline on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to section
313(d) (2)(B) based on the chronic toxicity data for this chemical. 
44. 

5-Chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol

 (CAS No. 003380-34-5) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 3month dog feeding study, decreased red blood cell and hemoglobin
values, increased serum alkaline phosphatase, jaundice, and increased liver weight were observed at 25 mg/kg/day
(LOEL). No NOEL could be established. In another 3month dog feeding study, the LOEL of 25 mg/kg/day produced
morphologic changes in the liver (focal acidophilic granular degeneration of cytoplasm). The NOEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day.
In a 3month rat feeding study, 125 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced increased liver weights in males. The NOEL was
50 mg/kg/day. At 150 mg/kg/day (LOEL), decrease in triglycerides, increase in creatinine, decrease in red blood
cells, increase in spleen and heart weight, and cytomegaly were observed in another 3month rat feeding study
(NOEL was 50 mg/kg/day). In a 2year study, dietary administration of 15 mg/kg/day produced decreases in red
blood cells, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit as well as hepatic necrosis in males. At 50 mg/kg/day, there
were decreases in red blood cells in females. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological toxicity data for
this chemical. 
45. 

3-Chloro-2-methyl-1-propene

 (CAS No. 000563-47-3) (NTP) (Ref. 8). In an NTP gavage bioassay there was clear evidence of carcinogenicity from 3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene
in rats and mice. The substance induced adrenal cortex, testicular and gastrointestinal tumors in rats and adrenal
cortex and gastrointestinal tumors in mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for this chemical.

46. 

p-Chlorophenyl isocyanate

 (CAS No. 000104-12-1) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). p-Chlorophenyl isocyanate is very lethal following inhalation. The 4hour
mouse inhalation LC

50

 value is 0.053 mg/L. In addition, isocyanates as a class are generally severe skin, eye, and respiratory irritants
following acute exposure. 
EPA's exposure analysis indicates that p-chlorophenyl isocyanate concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility
site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated
to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
p-chlorophenyl isocyanate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute
toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
47. 

Chloropicrin

 (CAS No. 000076-06-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for chloropicrin include a rainbow
trout 96hour LC

50

 of 16.5 ppb, a bluegill 96hour LC

50

 of 105 ppb, and a 48hour EC

50

 of 80 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing chloropicrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
48. 

3-Chloropropionitrile

 (CAS No. 000542-76-7) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). 3-Chloropropionitrile is metabolized by hepatic
cytochrome P450 enzymes to release cyanide. The substance is readily absorbed both dermally and orally. The mouse
oral LD

50

 is 51.3 mg/kg. 
EPA's exposure analysis indicates that 3-chloropropionitrile concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility
site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated
to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
3-chloropropionitrile on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute
toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
49. 

p-Chloro-o-toluidine

 (CAS No. 000095-69-2) (IARC; NTP) (Ref. 8). p-Chloro-o-toluidine is classified as a Group B2 carcinogen by EPA; i.e.,
the compound is a probable human carcinogen. It is classified as a Group 2B carcinogen by IARC; i.e., a possible human
carcinogen. Epidemiology studies are inadequate in evaluating the carcinogenic potential of 4-chloro-o-toluidine
hydrochloride in humans. In a long-term feeding study by NCI, p-chloro-o-toluidine hydrochloride induced hemangiomas,
hemangiosarcomas, and vascular tumors in mice. An increase in the incidence of pituitary chromophobe adenomas was
observed in female rats following dietary administration. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
p-chloro-o-toluidine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity
data for this chemical. 
50. 

Chlorotrifluoromethane (CFC-13)

 (CAS No. 000075-72-9) (CAA OD) (Ref. 8). Chlorofluorocarbons, including chlorotrifluoromethane (CFC-13) are
known to release chlorine radicals into the stratosphere. Chlorine radicals act as catalysts to reduce the net amount
of stratospheric ozone. Stratospheric ozone shields the earth from ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (i.e., 290 to
320 nanometers). Decreases in total column ozone will increase the percentage of UV-B radiation, especially at its
most harmful wavelengths, reaching the earth's surface.
Exposure to UV-B radiation has been implicated by laboratory and epidemiologic studies as a cause of two types of nonmelanoma
skin cancers: squamous cell cancer and basal cell cancer. Studies predict that for every 1 percent increase in UV-B
radiation, nonmelanoma skin cancer cases would increase by about 1 to 3 percent. 
Recent epidemiological studies, including large case control studies, suggest that UV-B radiation plays an important
role in causing malignant melanoma skin cancer. Recent studies predict that for each 1 percent change in UV-B intensity,
the incidence of melanoma could increase from 0.5 to 1 percent. 
Studies have demonstrated that UV-B radiation can suppress the immune response system in animals, and, possibly,
in humans. Increases in exposure to UV-B radiation are likely to increase the incidence of cataracts and could adversely
affect the retina.
Aquatic organisms, particularly phytoplankton, zooplankton, and the larvae of many fishes, appear to be susceptible
to harm from increased exposure to UV-B radiation because they spend at least part of their time at or near the surface
of waters they inhabit. 
Increased UV-B penetration has been shown to result in adverse impacts on plants. Field studies on soybeans suggest
that yield reductions could occur in some cultivars of soybeans, while evidence from laboratory studies suggest
that two out of three cultivars are sensitive to UV-B. 
Because this increased UV-B radiation can be reasonably anticipated to lead to cancer and other chronic human health
effects and significant adverse environmental effects, there is sufficient evidence for listing chlorotrifluoromethane
(CFC-13) on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA sections 313(d)(2)(B) and (C). 
51. 

Chlorpyrifos methyl (O,O-dimethyl-O-(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl)phosphorothioate)

 (CAS No. 005598-13-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Humans experienced a 10 percent reduction in plasma cholinesterase activity
after 10 dermal exposures to 10 mg/kg/day and a 47 percent reduction after 4 dermal exposures to 25 mg/kg/day (exposures
were for 12 hours per day). Rabbits experienced a 97 to 100 percent reduction in plasma cholinesterase activity after
5 dermal exposures to 10 mg/kg/day for 12 hours a day or 2 dermal exposures to 25 mg/kg/day for 12 hours a day. In a 2year
rat feeding study, red blood cell and plasma cholinesterase inhibition were observed at 1 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL
was 0.1 mg/kg/day. In a 2year dog feeding study, plasma cholinesterase inhibition was observed at 1 mg/kg/day
(LOEL). The NOEL was 0.1 mg/kg/day. The oral rat LD

50

 is between 1,159 mg/kg and 3,833 mg/kg. Lethargy, ataxia, diarrhea, salivation, and tremors were observed in these
studies. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing chlorpyrifos methyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data. 
Aquatic acute toxicity values for chlorpyrifos methyl include a daphnid 48hour LC

50

 of 1.11 ppb and a rainbow trout 96hour LC

50

 of 12.6 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing chlorpyrifos methyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.

 (CAS No. 064902-72-3) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a rabbit developmental study, an increased incidence of fetal resorptions
was observed at the LOEL of 75 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. 
In a 3-generation rat reproduction study, a decrease in fertility index was observed at 125 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The
NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing chlorsulfuron on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental and reproductive toxicity data
for this chemical. 
53. 

Clomazone (2-[(2-chlorophenyl)methyl]-4,4-dimethyl-3-isoxazolidinone)

 (CAS No. 081777-89-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 90day dog feeding study, increased cholesterol and increased
absolute and relative liver weights were observed at 62.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day. Dietary
administration of 62.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) to dogs for 1year also produced increased cholesterol and increased
liver weights. The NOEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day. In a 90day mouse feeding study, megalocytosis of the liver cells
was seen at 2.6 mg/kg/day (LOEL). No NOEL was established. In a 2year rat feeding study, elevated cholesterol
levels and liver-to-body weight ratios were observed at 21.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 4.3 mg/kg/day. Dietary
administration of 62.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) to dogs for 1year increased cholesterol and liver weights. The NOEL
was 12.5 mg/kg/day. 
In a two-generation reproduction study, decreased pup viability, reduced survival, decreased body weight, and
nonfunctional limbs were observed in the offspring of rats that were orally administered 50 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The
NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing clomazone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and developmental toxicity data. 
54. 

Crotonaldehyde

 (CAS No. 004170-30-3) (RCRA APP8) (Ref. 8). Crotonaldehyde has been tested for carcinogenicity in one animal study.
When crotonaldehyde was administered to male F344 rats at 0, 42, or 421 mg/L for 113 weeks, there was a statistically
significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms (benign and malignant combined) in the low dose
group. The lack of tumorigenic effects at the high-dose group is believed to be due to the hepatotoxicity observed
in this group. At high dose, crotonaldehyde is cytotoxic; cells died before neoplasms are manifested. Crotonaldehyde
and other alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyls are chemically reactive compounds which can readily react with cellular
macromolecules such as DNA and proteins. Mutagenicity studies in a slightly modified preincubation Ames test have
clearly shown that crotonaldehyde is mutagenic. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing crotonaldehyde
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity and mutagenicity
data for this chemical. 
55. 

Cyanazine

 (CAS No. 021725-46-2) (CAL; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Cyanazine is a triazine-type herbicide. In a three-generation reproduction
study in Long-Evans rats, F

3

b female weanlings had increased relative brain weights and decreased relative kidney weights. The LOAEL was 4.05
mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 1.35 mg/kg/day. In rabbits that received cyanazine in gelatin capsules during gestation
days 6 to 18, there was increased postimplantation loss, decreased litter size, and alterations in ossification.
In addition, there were increased malformations in the offspring, including anophthalmia/microphthalmia, dilated
brain ventricles, dome cranium and thoracoschisis (the LOAEL was 2 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/day). Similar
developmental effects were reported in Fischer 344 rats administered cyanazine during gestation days 6 to 15 (the
LOAEL was 25 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL 5 was mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing cyanazine
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for this chemical.

Cycloate

 (CAS No. 001134-23-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Cycloate, a carbamate pesticide, is a cholinesterase inhibitor. Symptoms
of poisoning include salivation, lacrimation, convulsions, and death. Depressed plasma cholinesterase was observed
in a 9week rat inhalation study at 0.0025 mg/L. The NOEL was less than 0.0025 mg/L. Decreased serum cholinesterase
(in males and females) and Wallerian degeneration of nerve fibers in spinal cord and sciatic nerve (females) were
observed at 0.12 mg/L in a 10-week rat inhalation study (cholinesterase NOEL is 0.012 mg/L). In both inhalation studies,
animals were exposed for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week. Plasma, red blood cell, and brain cholinesterase inhibition was
reported in rats fed 8 mg/kg/day for 2 years. The NOEL was less than 8 mg/kg/day. Dose-related neuropathy and muscle
myopathy were observed. In a 2year rat feeding study, distended myelin sheath demyelination and nerve fiber
loss occurred at 3 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day. 
Decreased weight and survival were observed in the offspring of rats orally administered 24 mg/kg/day (LOEL) and
72 mg/kg/day of cycloate, respectively (duration and frequency of dosing not reported). The reproductive NOEL was
8 mg/kg/day. Decreased pup weight was observed at 20 mg/kg/day and decreased pup survival was observed at 50 mg/kg/day
in a 2-generation rat reproduction study. The NOEL values for these endpoints were 2.5 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day,
respectively. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing cycloate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological and developmental toxicity data.

Cyclohexanol

 (CAS No. 000108-93-0) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). Four rabbits exposed to 997 ppm (4 mg/L) for 11 days (6 hours/day, 5 days/week)
and a rabbit receiving dermal applications of approximately 2,500 mg/kg/day for 10 days (1 hour/day) developed tremors,
central nervous system depression, lethargy or hypothermia. 
Microscopic or degenerative changes were observed in the livers and kidneys of rabbits inhaling 145 ppm (0.59 mg/L)
of cyclohexanol for 50 days (6 hours/day, 5 days/week), or repeated doses at 272 ppm (1.1 mg/L). In addition, degenerative
myocardial effects were observed at this exposure level. Repeated inhalation exposure to higher doses (997 to 1,229
ppm; 4 to 5 mg/L) in rabbits resulted in degenerative changes in the brain and heart as well as liver and kidneys. 
Reproductive effects including testicular atrophy, loss of Type A spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatozoa,
``shrinkage'' of seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells, reductions in RNA protein, sialic acid, and glycogen in
testes, epididymis and seminal vesicles and increased testicular cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase were observed
in male rats or gerbils exposed to 15 mg/kg of cyclohexanol for 21 to 37 days. These changes were accompanied with decreased
fertility, and occurred at exposure levels which had no effect on the liver or kidney. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing cyclohexanol on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurological, hepatic, renal, myocardial, and reproductive toxicity data for

2,4-DB

 (CAS No. 000094-82-6) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). 2,4-DB (4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butanoic acid) is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type
herbicide. In a study involving beagle dogs fed a diet containing 2,4-DB for 90 days, a LOAEL of 25 mg/kg/day was determined,
based on internal hemorrhaging and mortality observed during the first 3 to 9 weeks of treatment. The NOAEL in this
study was 8 mg/kg/day. At this dose level, slight increases in liver weights were observed, but unaccompanied by any
gross or histopathologic lesions. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.008 mg/kg/day from the LOAEL. In a subchronic rat
feeding study, the LOAEL and NOAEL values determined were higher (the LOAEL was approximately 80 to 100 mg/kg/day;
the NOAEL was approximately 25 to 30 mg/kg/day), and were based on severe liver and kidney damage. 
In the above-mentioned subchronic (90day) dog feeding study, it was observed that the animals exposed to doses
of 2,4-DB at 25 mg/kg/day (the LOAEL) and higher exhibited aspermatogenesis within the first 3 to 9 weeks of treatment.
The offspring of rats orally exposed to 17 mg/kg of 2,4-DB during days 1 to 7 of gestation developed abnormalities.
There was also an increase in stillbirths at this dose level. In a separate study, offspring of rats orally exposed
to 416 mg/kg on days 5 or 9 of gestation exhibited increased preimplantation loss and/or developmental toxicity.

EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-DB on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)

 (CAS No. 001928-43-4) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI; IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-D 2-ethylhexyl ester is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type
herbicide. The 2-ethylhexyl moiety contains eight carbons and, therefore, is an isooctyl group. Developmental
toxicity following maternal exposure to 2,4-D isooctyl esters has been demonstrated in the rat and mouse. Fetotoxicity
occurred in offspring of rats exposed to 528 mg/kg during gestation days 8 through 11. Rats orally exposed to doses
as low as 302 mg/kg during gestation days 9 through 12 had musculoskeletal abnormalities. Exposure to a lower dose
(188 mg/kg) for a longer period during gestation (days 6 through 15) caused developmental effects on homeostasis
and effects on newborn growth statistics. In mice, 438 mg/kg administered orally during gestation days 8 to 12 also
caused effects on newborn growth statistics. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D 2-ethylhexyl ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for 2,4-D isooctyl esters, and on the toxic
effects of its metabolite 2,4-D.

Diazinon

 (CAS No. 000333-41-5) (CERCLA; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, causes plasma cholinesterase
inhibition and central nervous system depression. Significant inhibition of plasma cholinesterase was observed
in two men administered five doses of 0.025 mg/kg/day. Diazinon administered to men at doses of 0.05 mg/kg/day for
28 days caused a 35 to 40 percent reduction in plasma cholinesterase. A NOEL for cholinesterase inhibition of 0.02
mg/kg/day was identified from several controlled studies in humans. Clinical symptoms of diazinon poisoning include
headache, nausea, sweating, vomiting, and diarrhea all of which are indicative of neurotoxicity. Plasma cholinesterase
inhibition (93 percent) and red blood cell inhibition (90 percent) occurred in monkeys orally exposed to diazinon
in doses of 5 mg/kg/day for 52 weeks. The NOEL for inhibition of cholinesterase in this study was 0.05 mg/kg/day and
the LOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day. 
Urogenital defects in the offspring of female rats orally administered diazinon at doses of 26.4 mg/kg on days 12 to
15 of gestation has been reported. Diazinon also induced musculoskeletal abnormalities in offspring when administered
orally to mothers at doses of 45 mg/kg on days 8 to 12 of gestation. Post-implantation mortality was increased in female
rats administered 63.5 mg/kg on day 10 of gestation. Similar reproductive and developmental effects were observed
in mice. Oral administration of 3.96 mg/kg of diazinon (days 1 to 22 of gestation) caused decreased litter size and
delayed behavioral effects in the newborn. Doses of 0.210 mg/kg and 3.78 mg/kg administered orally on days 1 to 21 of
gestation caused abnormalities in the immune and reticuloendothelial system and biochemical and metabolic abnormalities
of the offspring, respectively. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diazinon on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental and chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical. 
Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for diazinon include a 96hour LC

50

 for rainbow trout of 90 ppb and a daphnid 96hour LC

50

 of 0.90 ppb. In addition, measured terrestrial wildlife acute toxicity data for diazinon include an oral LD

50

 for male mallard ducks of 3.54 mg/kg and an oral LD

50

 for male pheasants of 4.33 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diazinon on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
71.

 (CAS No. 010222-01-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Oral administration of 50 mg/kg/day (LOEL) to rats for 4 weeks produced
dyspnea and weight loss. The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day to rats for 13 weeks produced
dyspnea. The NOEL was 13 mg/kg/day. These data may be indicative of direct effects of the compound on the respiratory
system. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic respiratory data. 
72. 

Dicamba (3,6-Dichloro-2-methyoxybenzoic acid)

 (CAS No. 001918-00-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Decreased fetal body weights and increased post-implantation loss was
observed in the offspring of rabbits receiving 10 mg/kg/day of dicamba on days 6 through 18 of gestation. The LOEL was
10 mg/kg/day and NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD value of 0.03 mg/kg/day. In a separate
study, disorders of oxidative phosphorylation and focal necrosis in the heart were observed in newborn rats following
transplacental exposure to dicamba. In a developmental toxicity study, an increase in skeletal malformations was
seen in the offspring of rats orally administered 64 mg/kg/day on days 6 through 19 of gestation. EPA believes that
there is sufficient evidence for listing dicamba on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based

 (CAS No. 000099-30-9) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Dichloran, an aniline, is a potential inducer of methemoglobinemia. Either
single or repeated oral doses of dichloran produced enlarged livers and induction of microsomal enzymes in the rat.
Dogs fed 21 mg/kg/day had increases in serum transaminases. In Rhesus monkeys, where dichloran does not induce hepatic
enzymes, 160 mg/kg/day for 3 months caused hepatic centrilobular fatty infiltration and death. Inhalation exposure
to 0.17 mg/L produced elevated cholesterol levels and increased liver weight in a 3month rabbit study and increased
liver weight in a 21day rat study. In a 2year mouse study, dietary administration of 102.7 mg/kg/day
(LOEL) produced centrilobular hepatocyte enlargement, focal necrosis, acute inflammatory cell infiltration,
vacuolization of centrilobular hepatocytes, increased weight of the liver and increased incidence of erythropoiesis
in males. The NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dichloran on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data. 
74. 

3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine dihydrochloride

based on its potential to cause cancer in humans. 
76. 

trans-1,4-Dichloro-2-butene

 (CAS No. 000110-57-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Mortality in two of six rats was observed following inhalational exposure
to 62 ppm (0.34 mg/L) for 4 hours. An acute inhalation LC

50

 in rats was 86 ppm (0.44 mg/L). EPA's exposure analysis indicates that trans-1,4-dichloro-2-butene concentrations
are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases,
at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes
that there is sufficient evidence for listing trans-1,4-dichloro-2-butene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
77. 

Dichloromethylphenylsilane

 (CAS No. 000149-74-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). As a class, chlorinated silanes are very corrosive to the skin and mucous
membranes and liberate hydrochloric acid in the presence of water. The 2hour mouse inhalation LC

50

 value for dichloromethylphenylsilane is 0.17 mg/L. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that dichloromethylphenylsilane
concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring

 (CAS No. 000097-23-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Increased incidence of microphthalmia was observed in the offspring of
rats administered 25 mg/kg/day (teratogenic LOEL). The NOEL was 5.0 mg/kg/day. A dose of 75 mg/kg/day (fetotoxic
LOEL) produced delayed ossification of vertebral centra and sternaebrae, reduced body weight and length, and increased
resorptions in rat fetuses. The fetotoxic NOEL was 5.0 mg/kg/day. No other developmental studies were available.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dichlorophene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data. 
Aquatic acute toxicity values for dichlorophene include a measured 48hour LC

50

 of 50 ppb for Spicodioptomus (calanoid copipod). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dichlorophene
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data.

79. 

trans-1,3-Dichloropropene

 (CAS No. 010061-02-6) (CERCLA; CWA PPL) (Ref. 8). Clinical reports have documented the occurrence of histiocytic
lymphoma in two firemen and acute myelomonocytic leukemia in a farmer exposed accidently to 1,3-dichloropropene.
Information on the isomer or isomer mixture (i.e., trans/cis isomers) was not specified. The lymphoma and leukemia
were refractory to treatment, and all three men died. There is evidence that 1,3-dichloropropene may cause cancer
in rats and mice after oral exposure. In a 2year gavage study, rats treated with 25 or 50 mg/kg/day 1,3-dichloropropene
(53 percent cis isomer, 45 percent trans isomer, 1 percent epichlorhydrin) developed squamous cell papillomas and
carcinomas of the forestomach. Male rats also developed neoplastic nodules of the liver. Female mice that received
50 or 100 mg/kg/day developed squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas of the forestomach, transitional cell carcinomas
of the urinary bladder, and an increased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas. A statistically significant
increase in bronchioalveolar adenomas was noted in male mice exposed to 60 ppm (272 mg/L) 1,3-dichloropropene vapors
(50 percent cis isomer, 43 percent trans isomer). This benign lung tumor was not seen in female mice or in male or female
rats. IARC assigned 1,3-dichloropropene to Group 2B, i.e., possibly carcinogenic in humans. EPA believes that there
is sufficient evidence for listing trans-1,3-dichloropropene on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)

Diethatyl ethyl

 (CAS No. 038727-55-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 2year study, groups of six beagles/sex were given doses orally
from 0 to 31.25 mg/kg/day. The lowest dose (0.25 mg/kg/day) produced a positive Coombs test. EPA believes that there
is sufficient evidence for listing diethatyl ethyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based
on the available hematological toxicity data for this chemical. 
83. 

Diflubenzuron

 (CAS No. 035367-38-5) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). In a 2year study in which beagle dogs received diflubenzuron daily
in gelatin capsules, the LOAEL for increases in sulfhemoglobin and methemoglobin was 10 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was
2 mg/kg/day. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.02 mg/kg/day for this chemical from this study. Similar effects were noted
in two separate 2year rat feeding studies (the LOAEL was 7.8 to 8 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 2 mg/kg/day), and in
a lifetime oral study in mice (the LOAEL was 12 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 2.4 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing diflubenzuron on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
hematological toxicity data. Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for diflubenzuron include a 48hour LC

50

 of 4.55 ppb for daphnids. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diflubenzuron on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
84.

 (CAS No. 055290-64-7) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 1year dog feeding study, decreased erythrocyte, hemoglobin,
and hematocrit levels as well as increased platelet levels were observed at 75 mg/kg/day. The LOEL for systemic toxicity
based on decreased body weight was 7.5 mg/kg/day. No NOEL could be established. In a 2year rat feeding study,
increased absolute and relative liver weights were observed at 10 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day. Based
on the NOEL in the study, EPA established an oral RfD of 0.02 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing dimethipin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological
and hepatic toxicity data. 
86. 

Dimethoate

 (CAS No. 000060-51-5) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Dimethoate is an organophosphate
insecticide. In humans, dimethoate causes typical symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition (sweating, diarrhea,
salivation, headache, difficulty in breathing, etc.). In a controlled human study, subjects were administered
dimethoate for 57 days. Whole blood and erythrocyte cholinesterase inhibition was observed from day 20 on. The NOEL
was 0.202 mg/kg/day, and the LOEL was 0.434 mg/kg/day. In another study in which humans were administered dimethoate
for 57 days, the NOEL for cholinesterase inhibition was 15 mg/day (0.2 mg/kg based on a 70 kg person). The LOEL was not
specified. Cholinergic symptoms reflective of cholinesterase inhibition following dimethoate administration
have also been observed in laboratory animals. A 2year feeding study in rats determined the NOEL and LOEL for
plasma and brain cholinesterase inhibition to be 0.05 and 0.5 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
Dimethoate was tested for developmental effects in Wistar rats. Cygon 4E (47.3 percent dimethoate, 52.7 percent
unspecified constituents) was administered to pregnant females on days 6 to 15 of gestation. The NOEL for developmental
effects was 6 mg/kg/day. At a LOEL of 12 mg/kg/day, an increase in the incidence of wavy ribs was observed in the fetuses.
An increase in offspring mortality occurred in a five-generation chronic feeding study (actual doses were 9.5 to
10.5 mg/kg/day) in male and female CD-1 mice. At 12 mg/kg/day (120 mg/kg, gestation days 6 to 15), musculoskeletal
abnormalities were observed in the rat offspring. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dimethoate
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental and neurotoxicity
data for this chemical. 
87.

 (CAS No. 020325-40-0) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). IARC has classified 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine (o-dianisidine) as a Group
2B compound, i.e., this chemical is possibly carcinogenic. In an NTP carcinogenicity bioassay, increases in neoplasms
of the skin, oral cavity, large intestine, liver, uterus, and cervix were noted in rats administered this chemical
in drinking water at dose levels of 6, 12, or 21 mg/kg/day in males and 7, 14, or 23 mg/kg/day in females. The dihydrochloride
salt of o-dianisidine is expected to be equally as toxic as the free base (o-dianisidine). EPA believes that there
is sufficient evidence for listing 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine dihydrochloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on its potential to cause cancer in humans. 
88. 

3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine hydrochloride (o-Dianisidine hydrochloride)

 (CAS No. 111984-09-9) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). IARC has classified 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine (o-dianisidine) as a Group
2B compound, i.e., this chemical is possibly carcinogenic. In an NTP carcinogenicity bioassay, increases in neoplasms
of the skin, oral cavity, large intestine, liver, uterus and cervix were noted in rats administered this chemical
in drinking water at dose levels of 6, 12, or 21 mg/kg/day in males and 7, 14, or 23 mg/kg/day in females. The hydrochloride
salt of o-dianisidine is expected to be equally as toxic as the free base (o-dianisidine). EPA believes that there

Dimethylamine

 (CAS No. 000124-40-3) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). Dimethylamine is corrosive to the mucous membranes, respiratory tract and
eyes of treated animals. B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats exposed to 10 to 175 ppm (0.018 to 0.32 mg/L) dimethylamine via inhalation
for 6 to 12 months developed dose-related lesions in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium. Significant decreases
in body weight occurred in high-dose (175 ppm; 0.32 mg/L) animals of both species, and some of the high-dose mice died
following exposure. Centrilobular fatty degeneration and necrosis of parenchymal cells were reported in mice,
rats, rabbits or guinea pigs administered 97 or 183 ppm (0.18 or 0.34 mg/L) dimethylamine via inhalation for 18 to 20
weeks. Increased liver weight without any histopathological changes were reported following 8month oral
exposure of rats to 0.35 mg/kg/day and guinea pigs exposed to 3.5 mg/kg/day. 
Rats administered oral doses of dimethylamine as low as 0.035 mg/kg for 8 months exhibited changes in conditional
reflexes including marked attenuation of the excitation process and speedier extinction of the positive reflex.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dimethylamine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic respiratory, hepatic, and neurological toxicity of this chemical. 
90. 

Dimethylamine dicamba

 (CAS No. 002300-66-5) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a pilot rabbit developmental toxicity study, an increase in early and
late fetal resorptions was observed in animals receiving the LOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day (oral
doses, days 6 to 18 of gestation). In another study, increased post-implantation loss was observed in rabbits receiving
the LOEL of 10 mg/kg/day (oral doses, days 6 to 18 of gestation). Developmental toxicity was also observed at doses
of 10 mg/kg/day in studies with dicamba. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dimethylamine
dicamba on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity
data for this chemical. 
91. 

3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride

 (o-Tolidine dihydrochloride) (CAS No. 000612-82-8) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). In a bioassay conducted by NTP, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine
dihydrochloride was found to be carcinogenic in both mice and rats. Male and female mice exposed to concentrations
of 5 to 140 ppm (0.95 to 26.6 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for 112 weeks developed lung alveolar cell adenoma and adenocarcinoma.
Male and female F344 rats exposed to concentrations of 30 to 150 ppm (4.2 to 21 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for 60 to
61 weeks developed tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung and oral cavity. Tumors in the skin, Zymbal's
gland, preputial gland in males, clitoral gland and mammary gland in females, and leukemia in females were also noted
in this study. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on its potential to cause cancer in humans. 
92. 

3,3'-Dimethylbenzidine dihydrofluoride (o-Tolidine dihydrofluoride)

 (CAS No. 041766-75-0) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). Neither IARC or EPA has classified 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrofluoride
with respect to carcinogenicity. In a bioassay conducted by NTP, however, 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride
was found to be carcinogenic in both mice and rats. Male and female mice exposed to concentrations of 5 to 140 ppm (0.952
to 6.6 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for 112 weeks developed lung alveolar cell adenoma and adenocarcinoma. Male and
female F344 rats exposed to concentrations of 30 to 150 ppm (4.2 to 21 mg/kg/day) in drinking water for 60 to 61 weeks
developed tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, lung, and oral cavity. Tumors in the skin, Zymbal's gland,
preputial gland in males, clitoral gland and mammary gland in females, and leukemia in females were also noted in this
study. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrofluoride on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on its potential to cause cancer in humans and on the carcinogenicity
data for 3,3'-dimethylbenzidine dihydrochloride. 93. 

Dimethyl chlorothiophosphate

 (CAS. No. 002524-03-0) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). In a dominant lethal study, male rats were administered dimethyl chlorothiophosphate
by gavage for 5 consecutive days and mated to untreated females. The LOEL of 7.5 mg/kg/day was determined based on an
increase in preimplantation losses and dead implants. No NOEL for dimethyl chlorothiophosphate was determined
from this study. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dimethyl chlorothiophosphate on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
94. 

Dimethyldichlorosilane

 (CAS No. 000075-78-5) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). As a class, however, chlorinated silanes are very corrosive to
the skin and mucous membranes and liberate hydrochloric acid in the presence of water. Dimethyldichlorosilane causes
severe burns and the vapor is harmful to humans. The 2hour mouse inhalation LC

50

 value is 0.30 mg/L. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that dimethyldichlorosilane concentrations are likely to
exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that
can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is
sufficient evidence for listing dimethyldichlorosilane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A)
based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
95. 

N,N-Dimethylformamide

 (CAS No. 000068-12-2) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). In humans, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) produced an increase in subjective
symptoms suggestive of mild liver dysfunction in workers and changes in objective measurements of liver damage (serum
enzymes and liver enlargement) via inhalation exposure, resulting in a LOAEL of 22 mg/m3 (adjusted LOAEL of 7.9 mg/m3)).
Although there are several additional studies which are generally inadequate when considered individually, taken
together, these studies demonstrate that DMF exposure is associated with hepatic toxicity in humans. Several animal
inhalation studies further support the hepatotoxic effects of DMF. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing N,N-dimethylformamide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based upon the available
hepatotoxicity data for this chemical. 
96. 

2,6-Dimethylphenol

 (000576-26-1) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). Oral administration of 2,6-dimethylphenol to rats for 8 months produced histologic
lesions (the LOEL was 6.0 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.6 mg/kg/day) in the liver, kidneys, and spleen. Another supporting
oral study in rats that also reported histological lesions in the liver and kidneys (the LOEL was 6.0 mg/kg/day; the
NOEL was 0.06 mg/kg/day) of rats following subchronic oral administration of 2,6-dimethylphenol. EPA believes
that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,6-dimethylphenol on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity data for this chemical. 
97. 

Dinocap

 (CAS No. 039300-45-3) (CAL; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Dinocap is a dinitrophenyl-type fungicide. In mice, oral administration
of 25 mg/kg/day of dinocap on days 7 to 16 of gestation has been shown to increase post-implantation mortality and reduce
newborn viability. Oral administration of 5.0 mg/kg/day to pregnant mice produced developmental toxicity in the
offspring (administration of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in abnormalities of the musculoskeletal and hepatobiliary
system in the offspring). In the same study, oral administration of 20 mg/kg/day on days 7 to 16 of gestation produced
craniofacial abnormalities in offspring. In the same study, behavioral abnormalities and delayed growth were observed
in offspring of mice receiving 12 mg/kg/day on days 7 to 16 of gestation. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing dinocap on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity
data for this chemical. 
Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for dinocap indicate that the LC

50

 for rainbow trout is 15 ppb and the LC

50

 for bluegill is 20 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dinocap on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
98.

 (CAS No. 000088-85-7) (CAL; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR; RCRA APP8; RCRA P; SDWA) (Ref. 8). Dinoseb is a dinitrophenyl-type
herbicide and insecticide. In a three generation reproduction study dinoseb produced decreased pup weights (the
LOEL was 1 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was not determined) in the F

1b

, F

2a

, and F

3a

 pups. The F

1b

 pup weights diminished (combined sexes) by day 21 at dose levels greater than 1 mg/kg/day. Other studies have shown
biologically and statistically significant increases in developmental malformations and/or anomalies (the LOEL
was 10 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day), and an increased incidence of an absence of ossification for a number of
skeletal sites and supernumerary ribs (the LOEL was not specified; the NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day). Dinoseb administered
by gavage to rabbits from days 6 to 18 of gestation produced neural tube defects (the LOEL was 10 mg/kg/day; the NOEL
was 3 mg/kg/day). 
The fertility index in male rats was reduced in a reproductive study in animals fed dinoseb at dose levels of 15.6 mg/kg/day
or 22.2 mg/kg/day over an 11week period. Decreased seminal vesicle weight, decreased sperm count and increased
incidence of abnormal sperm were noted at dose levels of 9.1 mg/kg/day and higher. The NOEL was 3.8 mg/kg/day. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dinoseb on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental and reproductive toxicity data for this chemical. 
Aquatic acute toxicity data for dinoseb include a measured fat-head minnow 96hour LC

50

 of 88 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dinoseb on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
99. 

Diphenamid

 (CAS No. 000957-51-7) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Diphenamid is a diphenylacetamide-type herbicide. In a 2year study
in dogs fed diphenamid, an increase in liver weight and an increase in portal macrophages and fibroblasts were seen
at the LOEL of 10 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL, an RfD of 0.03 mg/kg/day was derived. In a 2year
study in rats fed diphenamid, an increase in liver weight was seen at the LOEL of 30 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day.
Although, no histopathological changes were reported in these studies, biochemical changes accompanied by histo-pathological
changes were observed in a 2generation study in rat pups. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for
listing diphenamid on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatotoxicity
data for this chemical. 
100. 

Diphenylamine

 (CAS No. 000122-39-4) (RCRA APP8) (Ref. 8). Increased liver and kidney weights were noted in dogs that received 25
mg/kg/day (the LOAEL) of diphenylamine in their feed for 2 years. The NOAEL in this study was 2.5 mg/kg/day and the oral
RfD was 0.025 mg/kg/day. Pronounced anemia and decreased body weight gain were also noted in these animals. The hepatotoxicity
induced by diphenylamine is manifested by peripherolobular fat changes and increased lipids. Vacuolar degeneration
and hepatocyte necrosis were reported in rats or guinea pigs that received 2 or 4 percent (i.e., 1,000 or 2,000 mg/kg/day
for rats and 800 to 1,600 mg/kg/day for guinea pigs) of diphenylamine in the diet for 6 months. In another 2year
rat study, changes reported in the kidney in diphenylamine-fed animals included epithelial necrosis in the proximal
tubule, cystic dilatation of tubules, and interstitial inflammation. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diphenylamine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic hepatic and renal toxicity data for this chemical.

i.e., a probable human carcinogen. This classification is based on the findings of multiple malignant and benign
tumors in the rat (liver adenomas and carcinomas in both sexes, kidney carcinomas in both sexes, benign testes tumors
in males and uterine tumors in females), and multiple malignant tumors in the mouse (liver adenomas and carcinomas
in both sexes and lung/bronchiolar adenomas and carcinomas in males). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing dipropyl isocinchomeronate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the
available carcinogenicity toxicity data. 
103. 

Disodium cyanodithioimidocarbonate

 (CAS No. 000138-93-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Rats administered disodium cyanodithioimidocarbonate by gavage on gestation
days 6 to 15 demonstrated increased skeletal variations in offspring. The NOEL is 6 mg/kg, and the LOEL is 18 mg/kg.
In a rabbit teratology study, increased resorptions were observed in rabbits administered the compound by gavage
on gestation days 6 to 18. The NOEL is 3 mg/kg, and the LOEL is 10 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing disodium cyanodithioimidocarbonate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based
on the available developmental toxicity data. 
104. 

2,4-D isopropyl ester

 (CAS No. 000094-11-1) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI: IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-D isopropyl ester is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type herbicide.
In mammals, the isopropyl ester of 2,4-D is hydrolyzed to yield the free acid, 2,4-D. Therefore, the toxicity of 2,4-D
isopropyl ester is expected to be similar to that of 2,4-D, in which the kidney, liver, and nervous system are the primary
targets of injury. 2,4-D is presently included in the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals. EPA believes that
there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D isopropyl ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on the known toxic effects of its metabolite 2,4-D. 
105. 

2,4-Dithiobiuret

 (CAS No. 000541-53-7) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). In experimental animals, 2,4-dithiobiuret
is a highly toxic substance that causes death through respiratory depression and respiratory failure. Rats receiving
1 mg/kg/day for 6 days suffered from delayed onset of neuromuscular depression. Rats given 2,4-dithiobiuret for
52 days showed signs of muscle weakness after a latency period of 3 to 4 days. The NOEL was determined to be 0.125 mg/kg/day.
The LOEL was 0.25 mg/kg/day. The cause of the muscle weakness was depressed neuromuscular transmission. EPA believes
that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-dithiobiuret on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on the chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical. 
106. 

Dithiopyr (2-(difluoromethyl)-4-(2-methylpropyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-3,5-pyridinedicarbothioic acid
S,S-dimethyl ester)

 (CAS No. 097886-45-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 2-generation rat reproduction study, decreased body weight, diffuse
hepatocellular swelling, and ``white spots'' on the livers were observed in the offspring of rats administered greater
than or equal to 16.4 mg/kg/day. The NOEL values were 1.7 mg/kg/day. In a 13week rat feeding study, the LOEL of
6.62 mg/kg/day produced diffuse hepatocellular swelling. The NOEL was 0.662 mg/kg/day. In a 13-week dog feeding
study, increased alkaline phosphatase, discolored livers, and cholestasis was observed at 10 mg/kg/day (LOEL).
The NOEL was 1 mg/kg/day. In addition, at 30 mg/kg/day, increased serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase and serum
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, increased liver and kidney weights, and decreased cholesterol and albumin
were observed. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing dithiopyr on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and renal toxicity data. 
107. 

Diuron

 (CAS No. 000330-54-1) (CERCLA) (Ref. 8). In a 2year study in dogs administered diuron, sulfhemoglobin (an
abnormal blood pigment) was detected following doses as low as 3.125 mg/kg/day (LOAEL). The NOAEL was 0.625 mg/kg/day.
Higher doses (6.25 and 31.25 mg/kg/day) caused decreased red blood cell, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values. The
highest dose tested (31.25 mg/kg/day) also caused an increase in erythrogenic activity in the bone marrow, hemosiderosis
in the spleen, increased liver weight, and body weight loss. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day for this
chemical from this study. Similar effects (anemia, increased erythrogenic activity in the bone marrow, and abnormal
pigments in the blood) were also observed in rats exposed orally to doses as low as 6.25 mg/kg/day for 2 years, or to 250
mg/kg/day for 90 days. In a 7week study, rats receiving diuron doses of greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day
had decreased red blood cells and significantly increased methemoglobinemia. 
Offspring of Wistar rats fed diuron during days 6 to 15 of gestation showed developmental toxicity, that included
malformed ribs, extra ribs, and delayed ossification. The developmental LOAEL in this study was 100 mg/kg/day. No
NOAEL was determined. Maternal and fetal body weights decreased at 400 mg/kg/day. In a three-generation reproduction
study in rats fed diuron at 6.25 mg/kg/day, decreased body weights were reported in the F

2b

 and F

3a

 litters. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diuron on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological and developmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
The measured aquatic toxicity data for diuron includes a 1.5hour EC

50

 of 0.010 ppm (10 ppb) for marine green algae. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diuron on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.

2,4-D 2-octyl ester

 (CAS No. 001917-97-1) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI; IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-D 2-octyl ester is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type herbicide.
The 2-octyl moiety contains eight carbons and, therefore, is an isooctyl group. Developmental toxicity following
maternal exposure to 2,4-D isooctyl esters has been demonstrated in the rat and mouse. Fetotoxicity occurred in offspring
of rats exposed to 528 mg/kg during gestation days 8 to 11. Rats orally exposed to doses as low as 302 mg/kg during gestation
days 9 through 12 had musculoskeletal abnormalities. Exposure to a lower dose (188 mg/kg) for a longer period during
gestation (days 6 through 15) caused developmental effects on homeostasis and effects on newborn growth statistics.
In mice, 438 mg/kg administered orally during gestation days 8 through 12 also caused effects on newborn growth statistics.

EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D 2-octyl ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for 2,4-D isooctyl esters, and the toxic effects of
its metabolite 2,4-D. 
The aquatic acute toxicity data for 2,4-D isooctyl esters include a measured 48hour LC

50

 of 8.8 ppm for bluegill. In addition, 2,4-D isooctyl esters are expected to bioaccumulate based on the estimated log
K

ow

 of 6.6. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-D isooctyl esters on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to section EPCRA 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data and the potential for bioaccumulation.

herbicide. Developmental toxicity has been reported in rats and mice administered oral doses of 2,4-DP as low as 20
mg/kg during gestation days 4 through 18. Behavioral changes and physical effects were observed in newborn rats,
while increased post-implantation loss was observed in the mothers. Exposure of mice to much higher doses (3,000
and 4,000 mg/kg) for shorter durations (i.e., gestation days 6 through 15) caused musculoskeletal abnormalities
and fetotoxicity. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 2,4-DP on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
111. 

2,4-D propylene glycol butyl ether ester

 (CAS No. 001320-18-9) (CERCLA; FIFRA AI; IARC) (Ref. 8). 2,4-D propylene glycol butyl ether ester is a 2,4-dichlorophenoxy-type
herbicide. In mammals, the propylene glycol butyl ether ester is expected to hydrolyze to yield the free acid, 2,4-D.
Therefore, the toxicity of 2,4-D propylene glycol butyl ether ester is expected to be similar to that of 2,4-D, in which
the kidney, liver, and nervous system are the primary targets of injury. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing 2,4-D propylene glycol butyl ether ester on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)

Ethoprop (phosphorodithioic acid O-ethyl S,S-dipropyl ester)

 (CAS No. 013194-48-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Ethoprop is acutely toxic to animals. The acute oral LD

50

 in rats is 5.62 mg/kg/day. Clinical signs of toxicity observed in animals at this dose level included depression,
salivation, inactivity, convulsions and prostration. Similar signs were reported at the 4hour inhalation
LC

50

 of 0.12 mg/L in rats. In a 2year rat chronic feeding study, plasma, red blood cell, and brain cholinesterase
inhibition were observed in both sexes at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.05 mg/kg/day. Similar results were reported
in a chronic dietary study in mice at 0.1 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.01 mg/kg/day. The two chronic studies together with
the results of acute studies indicate the potential neurotoxicity of ethoprop. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing ethoprop on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
neurological toxicity data. 
Aquatic acute toxicity values for ethoprop include a mysid 96hour LC

50

 of 7.5 ppb, a shrimp 96hour LC

50

 of 13 ppb, and a daphnid 48hour EC

50

 of 93 ppb. Avian acute and dietary toxicity data include a ring-necked pheasant 14day LD

50

 of 4.2 mg/kg and a mallard duck 14day LD

50

 of 12.6 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing ethoprop on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to

of headache, malaise, nausea, and impaired working ability. Poisoned animals exhibited salivation, lacrimation,
blepharospasm, and depression. Neuropathy was observed in rats orally administered 25 mg/kg/day for 2 years. The
LOEL was 25 mg/kg/day and the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. Decreased brain cholinesterase activity was observed in female
rats orally administered 15 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day. The 4-hour inhalation rat and cat lowest-lethal-concentration
values are 0.2 mg/L and 0.4 mg/L, respectively. Somnolence and salivation were observed in exposed animals. The dermal
rabbit LD

50

 is 10,000 mg/kg. Depressed righting reflexes, prostration, and clonic convulsions were observed. 
In a 2year dietary rat study, degenerative cardiomyopathy was observed in males receiving 9 mg/kg/day of EPTC.
No NOEL was established. This effect was observed in females at 36 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 18 mg/kg/day. In a 2-generation
rat reproduction study, parental toxicity included cardiomyopathy observed in rats orally administered 10 mg/kg/day.
Based on the NOEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.025 mg/kg/day. In a 2year dietary rat study, chronic
myocarditis was observed at the LOEL of 125 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. 
An increased incidence of fetal resorptions, increased incidence of fetal retardations, and decreased fetal body
weights were observed in rats receiving 300 mg/kg/day of EPTC on days 6 to 15 of gestation. The LOEL was 300 mg/kg/day
and the NOEL was 100 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day. In a 2-generation rat reproduction study, decreased pup
weight was observed in both generations at 40 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day.

inhibitor. In a 90day feeding study, rats given diets supplemented with famphur showed decreased plasma and
brain cholinesterase activity at 1.25 mg/kg/day, and decreased whole blood cholinesterase activity at 0.15 mg/kg/day.
A bull was treated with famphur for 43 days before signs of neurotoxicity appeared. The symptoms, including paresis
of all four limbs, were attributed to focal cervical or diffuse spinal cord lesions. Calves receiving 60.75 mg/kg
showed marked inhibition of whole blood cholinesterase. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
famphur on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity known for
this chemical. 
Measured terrestrial wildlife acute toxicity data for famphur indicate that the oral LD

50

 values for the redwinged blackbird and the starling are 1.78 mg/kg and 4.22 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, the
measured oral LD

50

 for mallard ducks is 3.45 mg/kg (based on 35 percent active ingredient). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing famphur on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity
data for this chemical.

Fenoxaprop ethyl (2-(4-((6-chloro-2-benzoxazolylen)oxy)phenoxy)propanoic acid,ethyl ester)

 (CAS No. 066441-23-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 30day mouse feeding study, liver weight increases were observed
(LOEL 20 ppm or 2.6 mg/kg/day and NOEL 10 ppm or 1.3 mg/kg/day). In a 32day rat feeding study, changes in the liver
and kidney as well as altered lipid metabolism and decreased cholesterol were observed. The LOEL in the rat study was
80 ppm (4 mg/kg/day). The NOEL was 20 ppm (1 mg/kg/day). Inflammatory changes in the kidney (chronic interstitial
nephritis) were reported in dogs that received a 3month feeding of 80 ppm (2 mg/kg/day, the LOEL). The NOEL was
16 ppm or 0.4 mg/kg/day. Decreased serum lipids and cholesterol were reported in rats exposed for 2 years to dietary
levels greater than or equal to 180 ppm (9 mg/kg/day, the LOEL). The NOEL in this study was 30 ppm (1.5 mg/kg/day). 
In a developmental toxicity study, fetotoxic effects (slightly impaired growth and delayed ossification) were
reported at 100 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 32 mg/kg/day. These effects were observed at doses that were also toxic to maternal
animals. In a 2generation reproductive toxicity feeding study in rats, decreased survival, decreased body
weight at study termination, and significant changes in kidney and liver weights were reported in the F

2a

 and F

2b

 litters. The fetotoxic LOEL in this study was 5 ppm (0.25 mg/kg/day, the lowest dose tested). The LOEL and NOEL for maternal
toxicity (increased kidney and liver weights) were 80 ppm (4 mg/kg/day) and 30 ppm (1.5 mg/kg/day), respectively.
Thus, the fetotoxic effects were observed at doses lower than those that produced maternal toxicity.

Fluazifop butyl (2-[4-[[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy]-phenoxy]propanoic acid, butyl ester)

 (CAS No. 069806-50-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). A 3month rat feeding study demonstrated hepatocyte hypertrophy
in males (the LOEL was 5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day). In a 1year feeding study, dogs had changes in
serum alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase and/or alanine sulfatransferase (the LOEL was 25 mg/kg/day;
the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day). Similar changes were also reported in dogs following 3 months exposure in their diet (the
LOEL was 125 mg/kg/day). In a carcinogenicity study, male mice fed 20 ppm (2.6 mg/kg/day, the LOEL) had an increased
incidence of hepatocyte hypertrophy. The NOEL was 5 ppm or 0.65 mg/kg/day. Male and female mice exposed to a higher
dose of 80 ppm (10.4 mg/kg/day) had increased liver weight (relative and absolute) and hypertrophy of periacinal
hepatocytes. Males in this dose group also had increased pigmentation in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. 
In a teratogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats exposed via oral gavage, delayed ossification and an increased
incidence of hydroureter were observed in fetuses (the fetotoxic LOEL was 5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL 1 mg/kg/day) and a
teratogenic LOEL of 200 mg/kg/day (the NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day) was determined based on the incidence of diaphragmatic
hernia. Maternal toxicity was observed in this study at doses higher than those causing fetotoxicity and included
reduced body weight gain and decreased gravid uterus (the maternal LOEL was 200 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day).
In a 2-generation reproductive toxicity dietary study in Wistar rats, the reproductive LOEL of 250 ppm (12.5 mg/kg/day;
the NOEL was 80 ppm or 4 mg/kg/day) was based on reduced litter sizes, reduced viability, reduced testis and epididymis
weights and tubular atrophy in offspring. Fetotoxicity (delayed ossification and eye opacities) was also demonstrated
in New Zealand White rabbits (the LOEL was 30 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing fluazifop butyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
hepatic and developmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
125. 

Flumetralin (2-chloro-N-(2,6-dinitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)- phenyl)-N-ethyl-6-fluorobenzenemethanamine)

 (CAS No. 062924-70-3) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Aquatic acute toxicity values for flumetralin include a daphnid 48hour
EC

50

 of greater than 2.8 ppb, a bluegill sunfish 96hour LC

50

 of greater than 3.2 ppb, and a rainbow trout 96hour LC

50

 of greater than 3.2 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing flumetralin on EPCRA section 313
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
126. 

Fluorine

 (CAS No. 007782-41-4) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Inhalation of fluorine causes initial coughing,
choking and chills, which is followed 1 or 2 days later with pulmonary edema. Fluorine has a strong caustic action on
mucous membranes, eyes and skin. In human volunteers exposed to 100 ppm (0.16 mg/L) for 30 seconds, much irritation
to the nose and eyes was reported. In acute inhalation studies in animals, lethality occurs at a fairly uniform level
and is the result of pulmonary edema. Following 1 hour exposures in mice, rats or guinea pigs, the inhalation LC

50

 values ranged from 150 to 185 ppm (0.23 to 0.29 mg/L). The LC

50

 for rabbits following a 30-minute exposure was 270 ppm (0.42 mg/L). EPA's exposure analysis indicates that fluorine
concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring
releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fluorine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
127. 

Fluorouracil (5-Fluorouracil)

 (CAS No. 000051-21-8) (CAL; EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). A major use of fluorouracil is in the palliative treatment of carcinoma
of the colon, rectum, breast, stomach, and pancreas that is not amenable to surgery or irradiation. The major toxic
effects of fluorouracil are on the normal, rapidly proliferating tissues particularly of the bone marrow and lining
of the gastrointestinal tract. Leukopenia, predominantly of the granulocytopenic type, thrombocytopenia, and
anemia occur commonly with intravenous fluorouracil therapy at doses ranging from 6 to 12 mg/kg. Pancytopenia and
agranulocytosis also have occurred.
Developmental abnormalities or other effects on newborns were reported in offspring of women receiving 150 or 240
mg/kg fluorouracil intravenously during weeks 11 to 14 or 20 to 31 of pregnancy. In addition, maternal toxicity to
the reproductive organs, toxicity to the fetus, and developmental abnormalities have been reported in mice, rats,
and hamsters receiving oral, intraperitoneal, or intramuscular doses of fluorouracil ranging from 10 to 700 mg/kg.

Chronic neurotoxic effects were noted in dogs fed fluorouracil at a dietary dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 6 months. In this
study, animals were examined at the end of 3 months and 6 months. At the end of the experiment, or at death, the brain was
removed and examined (only one dog survived the entire 6month period). Histological sections of the brain
showed the presence large multiple monolocular vacuoles in the wall of the fornix of the third ventricle. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fluorouracil on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the toxicity of this substance to bone marrow, and on the developmental and chronic neurotoxicity
data for this chemical. 
128. 

Fluvalinate (N-[2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]DL-valine(+)- cyano (3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl ester)

 (CAS No. 069409-94-5) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Delayed ossification and decreased weight and length of fetuses were observed
in offspring of rats orally administered 50 mg/kg/day (LOEL) on days 6 to 15 of gestation. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day.
These effects were observed at doses that produced maternal toxicity. Curved tibia and fibula were observed in the
offspring of rabbits orally administered 125 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. In a 2generation
reproduction study, a decrease in pup weight and growth were observed in offspring of rats orally administered 5 mg/kg/day
(LOEL). The NOEL was 1 mg/kg/day. Significantly decreased weight and survival were observed in offspring of rats
orally administered 25 mg/kg/day. 
In a range finding study, dietary administration of 50 mg/kg/day for 30 days produced skin lesions in rats. The NOEL
was not determined. A 2year rat feeding study was terminated at 64 weeks due to dermal lesions produced in animals
at 15 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day. Dietary administration of 10 mg/kg/day (LOEL for effect) to mice for 2 years
produced scabbing and dermal abrasion. No NOEL for these effects was established. An increase in plantar ulcers was
observed in rats fed 2.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) for 2 years. The NOEL was 1 mg/kg/day. Decreases in body weight gain were also
observed in this study. Based on the NOEL of the study, an oral RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day was derived. In a 2generation
rat reproduction study, dietary administration of 5 mg/kg/day produced decreased body weight gain and skin lesions
in parents and offspring. 
Dietary administration of 2.5 mg/kg/day to rats for 13 weeks produced anemia in blood parameters (decreased hematocrit,
hemaglobin, and red blood cells). The NOEL was 1.0 mg/kg/day. Dietary administration of 30 mg/kg/day (LOEL) to rats
for 3 months produced decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count in rats. The NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day.

EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fluvinate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental, dermal, and hematological toxicity data for this chemical.

Aquatic acute toxicity values for fluvalinate include a daphnid 48hour EC

50

 of 0.40 ppb, a bluegill sunfish 96hour LC

50

 of 0.9 ppb, a rainbow trout 96hour LC

50

 of 2.9 ppb, and a sheepshead minnow 96hour LC

50

 of 10.8 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fluvinate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
129. 

Folpet

 (CAS No. 000133-07-3) (CAL) (Ref. 8). Folpet is classified as a Group B2 compound by EPA; i.e., the substance is a probable
human carcinogen. Folpet has been shown to induce carcinoma and adenoma of the duodenum in both sexes of CD-1 and B6C3F1
mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing folpet on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for this chemical. 
Aquatic acute toxicity test data for folpet include a measured 96hour LC

50

 of 39 ppb for rainbow trout, and a measured 96hour LC

50

 of 72 ppb (0.072 ppm) for bluegill. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing folpet on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
130. 

Fomesafen (5-(2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)-N methylsulfonyl)-2-nitrobenzamide)

 (CAS No. 072178-02-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Decreased plasma cholesterol and triglycerides and increased liver weights
(reversible at 7 days post-treatment) were observed at 50 mg/kg/day (only dose tested) when administered in the diet
of rats for 4 weeks. In a 90day rat study, dietary administration of 5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced alterations
in lipid metabolism and increases in liver weight. The NOEL was 0.25 mg/kg/day. In a 26-week dog study, dietary administration
of 25 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced alterations in lipid metabolism and liver changes (changes not defined). The NOEL
was 1 mg/kg/day. Liver toxicity (increased liver masses, discolored hepatocytes, and pigmented Kupffer cells)
was observed in a 2year rat feeding study at 50 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. Metabolism studies
have shown that fomesafen accumulates in the liver. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing fomesafen
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic toxicity data for this
chemical. 
131. 

alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane

 (CAS No. 000319-84-6) (CERCLA; CWA PPL; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane is classified by EPA as
a Group B2 compound; i.e., the substance is a probable human carcinogen. Although human data are limited, there is
a case report of acute leukemia in a Japanese sanitation employee following occupational exposure to alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane
and DDT. alpha-Hexachlorocyclohexane has been shown in dietary studies to cause an increase in the incidence of liver
tumors in five mouse strains and in Wistar rats. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data for this chemical.

Measured aquatic acute toxicity test data for alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane include a 48hour EC

50

 of 800 ppb for daphnids. This chemical is expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic systems because the measured bioconcentration
factor (BCF) for rainbow trout is 1950. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical
and its potential for bioaccumulation. 
132. 

Hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyanate or Diisocyanates category

 (CAS No. 000822-60-0) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyanate (HDI) is extremely toxic via the inhalation
route. The rat LC

50

 for HDI ranges from 56 (385 mg/m

3

) to 45 ppm (310 mg/m

3

). The mouse LC

50

 for HDI is 4 ppm (30 mg/m

3

). HDI also induces irritation of the upper respiratory tract in mice after acute exposure. The mouse LOAEL was 0.062
ppm (0.43 mg/m

3

) for a 3hour exposure. A NOAEL was not established. Acute exposures to HDI vapors may induce pulmonary irritation
in the rat at 60 mg/m

3

, but data were insufficient to generate a LOAEL or NOAEL for this effect. 
Although the data are insufficient to evaluate the potential for HDI to produce pulmonary hypersensitivity, indirect
evidence suggests that inhalation of monomeric HDI may cause pulmonary sensitivity. In addition, data are insufficient
to evaluate the potential for HDI to elicit an allergic reaction in previously sensitized animals or people; however,
indirect evidence suggests that inhalation of monomeric HDI may elicit allergic responses (i.e., asthma, alveolitis)
in isocyanate-sensitized individuals. 
EPA's exposure analysis indicates that HDI concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries,
as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause
significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyanate
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data
for this chemical. 

EPA is proposing to list HDI as an individual chemical on EPCRA section 313. In addition, in Units IV.B.144. and 158.
of this preamble, EPA is proposing to individually list isophorone diisocyanate and 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane)
on EPCRA section 313. As an alternative proposal to the individual listing of HDI, isophorone diisocyanate, and 1,1-methylene
bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), EPA is proposing to create a diisocyanates category that includes HDI, isophorone
diisocyanate, 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), and 16 other diisocyanates. 

EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories, the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report is filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. 

The chemicals selected for this proposed category are members of the diisocyanates category under review by EPA's
Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. This category has been defined as monomeric diisocyanates of molecular
weight less than or equal to 300, plus polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (which is only 40 to 60 percent polymerized).
Chemicals were included in this category based on similar chronic and acute adverse respiratory effects. The following
chemicals are the proposed members of the EPCRA section 313 diisocyanates category: 




1,3-Bis(methylisocyanate)cyclohexane (CAS No. 038661-72-2) 
1,4-Bis(methylisocyanate)cyclohexane (CAS No. 010347-54-3) 
1,4-Cyclohexane diisocyanate (CAS No. 002556-36-7) Diethyldiisocyanatobenzene (CAS No. 134190-37-7) 
4,4'-Diisocyanatodiphenyl ether (CAS No. 004128-73-8) 
2,4'-Diisocyanatodiphenyl sulfide (CAS No. 075790-87-3) 
3,3'-Dimethoxybenzidine-4,4'-diisocyanate (CAS No. 000091-93-0) 
3,3'-Dimethyl-4,4'-diphenylene diisocyanate (CAS No. 000091-97-4) 
3,3'-Dimethyldiphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate (CAS No. 000139-25-3) Hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyanate (CAS
No. 000822-06-0) 
Isophorone diisocyanate (CAS No. 004098-71-0) 
4-Methyldiphenylmethane-3,4-diisocyanate (CAS No. 075790-84-0) 
1,1-Methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane) (CAS No. 005124-30-1) 
1,5-Naphthalene diisocyanate (CAS No. 003173-72-6) 
1,3-Phenylene diisocyanate (CAS No. 000123-61-5) 
1,4-Phenylene diisocyanate (CAS No. 000104-49-4) 
Polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (CAS No. 009016-87-9) 
2,2,4-Trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate (CAS No. 016938-22-0) 
2,4,4-Trimethylhexamethylene diisocyanate (CAS No. 015646-96-5) 
These diisocyanates represent a category of chemicals that may effect many organ systems. However, the primary toxicity
target for diisocyanates is the upper and lower respiratory tract resulting in chronic pulmonary irritation. Diisocyanates
are also known respiratory and dermal sensitizing agents. Both acute and chronic effects may result from acute or
chronic exposures. These effects may be immune- or non-immune mediated. EPA believes that diisocyanates should
be listed as a category because it is the isocyanate functionality that is responsible for the observed chronic pulmonary
irritation associated with exposures to members of this category. The other part of the molecule does not mitigate
to any large degree the observed toxic effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing diisocyanates
as a category on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available toxicity data for
members of the category. 
Currently there are four other diisocyanates listed on EPCRA section 313, these are: 
Toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (CAS No. 000584-84-9) 
Toluene-2,6-diisocyanate (CAS No. 000091-08-7) 
Toluenediisocyanate (mixed isomers) (CAS No. 026471-62-5) Methylenebis(phenylisocyanate) (CAS No. 000101-68-8)

EPA intends to maintain the individual listings for the three toluene diisocyanate compounds. In addition to the
effects discussed above, these compounds have been classified as probable carcinogens. EPA intends to continue
to individually list diisocyanates that are possible of probable carcinogens. Methylenebis(phenylisocyanate)
has not been shown to be a carcinogen and EPA is proposing to remove it as an individually listed chemical, and add it
to the diisocyanates category if the alternative proposal for creation of the category is finalized. 
EPA requests comment on the alternative proposal to create a diisocyanates category and what other diisocyanates
should be included in such a category. 133. 

n-Hexane

 (CAS No. 000110-54-3) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). In an epidemiology study, no neurological abnormalities were noted in workers.
However, neurophysiological tests showed that the mean motor nerve conduction velocities of the exposed group was
significantly decreased over the values for the control group. Also, the residual latency of motor nerve conduction
of the posterior tibial nerve in the exposed group was significantly slowed when compared with the nonexposed group.
A LOAEL of 204 mg/m

3

 (58 ppm, LOAEL(ADJ) of 73 mg/m

3

) was established for these electrophysiological alterations in humans. The alterations observed are consistent
with n-hexane-induced peripheral neuropathy observed in other studies in humans and in animals. EPA believes that
there is sufficient evidence for listing n-hexane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based
upon the available neurotoxicity data for this chemical. 
134. 

Hexazinone

 (CAS No. 051235-04-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 2year mouse feeding study, liver hypertrophy, hyperplastic
nodules and focal necrosis were observed at 375 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day. In a 90day feeding
study in dogs, decreased body weight, increased alkaline phosphatase activity, decreased albumin/globulin ratio
and increased absolute and relative liver weights were noted in both sexes at 5,000 ppm (125 mg/kg/day; LOEL). The
NOEL was 1,000 ppm (25 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing hexazinone on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available toxicity data for this chemical. 
Measured aquatic acute toxicity test data for hexazinone include an EC

50

 of 7 ppb for 

S. capricornutum

. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing hexazinone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
135. 

Hydramethylnon (tetrahydro-5,5-dimethyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone[3-[4- (trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1-[2-[4(trifluoromethyl)
phenyl]ethenyl]-2-propenylidene]hydrazone)

 (CAS No. 067485-29-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 90day dog feeding study, testicular atrophy was observed at
6 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day. In a 90day rat study, dietary administration of 5 mg/kg/day (LOEL)
produced testicular atrophy. The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day. Dietary administration of 6.5 mg/kg/day for 18 months produced
testicular lesions in mice. The NOEL was 2.75 mg/kg/day. In a 2year rat study, dietary administration of 5 mg/kg/day
produced decreased testicular weight and testicular atrophy. The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day. In a 3-generation rat reproduction
study, oral administration of 5 mg/kg/day produced male infertility. The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day. 
Decreased fetal weight was observed in the offspring of rats administered 30 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day.
Increased post implantation loss and decreased fetal viability were observed in the offspring of rabbits administered
15 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. Vertebral anomalies were seen in the offspring of rabbits administered
10 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. 
Dietary administration of 1 mg/kg/day (LOEL) for 6 months to dogs produced increased absolute and relative liver
weights. The NOEL was 0.33 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL of the study, an oral RfD of 0.0003 mg/kg/day was derived. EPA
believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing hydramethylnon on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available reproductive, developmental, and hepatic toxicity data for this chemical.

The 96hour LC

50

 in the Chanel Catfish was 90 ppb. Bioaccumulation factors in bluegill sunfish are 1300 for the whole fish, 780 for the
fillet, and 1900 for viscera. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing hydramethylon on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data and the potential
for bioaccumulation. 
136. 

Hydrochlorofluorocarbons

 (CAA OD) (Ref. 8). Hydrochlorofluorocarbons are known to release chlorine radicals into the stratosphere. Chlorine
radicals act as catalysts to reduce the net amount of stratospheric ozone. 
Stratospheric ozone shields the earth from ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation (i.e., 290 to 320 nanometers). Decreases
in total column ozone will increase the percentage of UV-B radiation, especially at its most harmful wavelengths,
reaching the earth's surface.
Exposure to UV-B radiation has been implicated by laboratory and epidemiologic studies as a cause of two types of nonmelanoma
skin cancers: squamous cell cancer and basal cell cancer. Studies predict that for every 1 percent increase in UV-B
radiation, nonmelanoma skin cancer cases would increase by about 1 to 3 percent. 
Recent epidemiological studies, including large case control studies, suggest that UV-B radiation plays an important
role in causing malignant melanoma skin cancer. Recent studies predict that for each 1 percent change in UV-B intensity,
the incidence of melanoma could increase from 0.5 to 1 percent. 
Studies have demonstrated that UV-B radiation can suppress the immune response system in animals, and, possibly,
in humans. Increases in exposure to UV-B radiation are likely to increase the incidence of cataracts and could adversely
affect the retina.
Aquatic organisms, particularly phytoplankton, zooplankton, and the larvae of many fishes, appear to be susceptible
to harm from increased exposure to UV-B radiation because they spend at least part of their time at or near the surface
of waters they inhabit. 
Increased UV-B penetration has been shown to result in adverse impacts on plants. Field studies on soybeans suggest
that yield reductions could occur in some cultivars of soybeans, while evidence from laboratory studies suggest
that two out of three cultivars are sensitive to UV-B. 
Because this increased UV-B radiation can be reasonably anticipated to lead to cancer and other chronic human health
effects and significant adverse environmental effects, EPA believes there is sufficient evidence for listing the
following HCFCs that are commercially viable on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA sections 313(d)(2)(B) and (C).
EPA is proposing that the following HCFCs be added individually to EPCRA section 313: 
Dichloropentafluoropropane (CAS No. 127564-92-5) 
1,3-Dichloro-1,1,2,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HCFC-225ea) (CAS No. 136013-79-1) 
2,2-Dichloro-1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HCFC-225aa) (CAS No. 128903-21-9) 
1,1-Dichloro-1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HCFC-225eb) (CAS No. 111512-56-2) 
1,1-Dichloro-1,2,2,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HCFC-225cc) (CAS No. 13474-88-9) 
1,3-Dichloro-1,1,2,2,3-pentafluoropropane (HCFC-225cb) (CAS No. 000507-55-1) 
1,2-Dichloro-1,1,3,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HCFC-225da) (CAS No. 000431-86-7) 
3,3-Dichloro-1,1,1,2,2-pentafluoropropane (HCFC-225ca) (CAS No. 000422-56-0) 
2,3-Dichloro-1,1,1,2,3-pentafluoropropane (HCFC-225ba) (CAS No. 000422-48-0) 
1,2-Dichloro-1,1,2,3,3-pentafluoropropane (HCFC-225bb) (CAS No. 000422-44-6) 
Dichlorofluoromethane (HCFC-21) (CAS No. 000075-43-4) 
1,1,1,2-Tetrachloro-2-fluoroethane (HCFC-121a) (CAS No. 000354-11-0) 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloro-1-fluoroethane
(HCFC-121) (CAS No. 000354-14-3) 
1,2-Dichloro-1,1-difluoroethane (HCFC-132b) (CAS No. 001649-08-7) 
2-Chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (HCFC-133a) (CAS No. 000075-88-7) 
3-Chloro-1,1,1-trifluoropropane (HCFC-253fb) (CAS No. 000460-35-5). 
137. 

Imazalil (1-[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(2-propenyloxy)ethyl]-1H-imidazole)

 (CAS No. 035554-44-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a rat teratology study, increased maternal mortality, decreased litter
size, and increased number of dead fetuses were observed in animals administered 40 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was
10 mg/kg/day. Stillbirths and altered live birth index were observed in rats orally administered 80 mg/kg/day days
16 through 22 of gestation and 21 days post gestation. Altered lactation index was observed in rats orally administered
20 mg/kg/day on days 16 through 22 of gestation and 21 days post gestation. Post-implantation loss was observed in
rabbits orally administered 0.63 mg/kg/day on days 6 through 18 of gestation. Altered viability index was observed
in rabbits orally administered 2.5 mg/kg/day on days 6 through 18 of gestation. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing imazalil on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
developmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
138. 

3-Iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate

 (CAS No. 055406-53-6) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 90day rat study, oral administration of 50 mg/kg/day (LOEL)
produced increased liver-to-body-weight ratios. The NOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. In a 2year rat study, dietary
administration of 40 and 80 mg/kg/day produced significant non-neoplastic pathological changes in the stomach.
No NOEL was established; the LOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. Based on this study, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.07 mg/kg/day. EPA
believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 3-iodo-2-propynyl butylcarbamate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for this chemical.

Iprodione (3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-N-(1-methylethyl)-2,4-dioxo-1-imidazolidinecarboxamide)

 (CAS No. 036734-19-7) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Increased red blood cell Heinz bodies and decreased prostate weight (the
LOEL was 15 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 4.2 mg/kg/day) were observed in dogs fed iprodione for 1year. Increased
Heinz bodies were also seen in females at 15 mg/kg/day. At 90 mg/kg/day, increased liver weight was noted in male and
female dogs. Based on the NOEL, an oral RfD of 0.04 mg/kg/day was derived. In another 1year feeding study in dogs,
decreased red blood cell counts and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels (the LOEL was 600 ppm or 15 mg/kg/day; the NOEL
was 100 ppm or 2.5 mg/kg/day) were observed. At 3,600 ppm (90 mg/kg/day), increased absolute and relative liver weights
and increase liver alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase,
and lactate dehydrogenase activities were noted. Decreased red blood cell count and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit
levels (the LOEL was 24.6 mg/kg/day in males, 26.4 mg/kg/day in females; the NOEL was 17.5 mg/kg/day in males, 18.4
mg/kg/day in females). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing iprodione on EPCRA section 313
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological and hepatic toxicity data for this chemical.

Acute aquatic toxicity data include a green algae 120hour EC

50

 of 21 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing iprodione on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
140. 

Iron pentacarbonyl

 (CAS No. 013463-40-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Humans exposed to high concentrations of iron pentacarbonyl immediately
experience headache and dizziness. These effects are followed 12 to 36 hours after exposure by symptoms such as fever,
cyanosis, cough, and shortness of breath. In humans, iron pentacarbonyl has also been known to cause adverse effects
on the respiratory and central nervous system, liver, and kidney. The rat oral LD

50

 is 25 mg/kg and the rat inhalation LC

50

 value is 0.044 mg/L. The 4hour inhalation LC

100

 in mice is 0.007 mg/L. The rabbit oral LD

50

 is 12 mg/kg. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that iron pentacarbonyl concentrations are likely to exist beyond
facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably
be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing iron pentacarbonyl on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available
acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
141. 

Isodrin

 (CAS No. 000465-73-6) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for isodrin
include a 24hour LC

50

 of 12 ppb for bluegills and a 24hour LC

50

 of 6 ppb for minnows. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing isodrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
142. 

Isofenphos (2-[[ethoxyl[(1-methylethyl) amino] phosphinothioyl] oxy] benzoic acid 1-methylethyl ester)

 (CAS No. 025311-71-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 108week feeding study in mice, inhibition of brain cholinesterase
(the LOEL was 100 ppm or 13 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 10 ppm or 1.3 mg/kg/day) and plasma cholinesterase (the LOEL was 10
ppm or 1.3 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.13 mg/kg/day) was observed. Inhibition of red blood cell cholinesterase (the
LOEL was 10 ppm or 0.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 1 ppm or 0.05 mg/kg/day) was seen in a 2year feeding study in rats.
Other studies (14 and 90day feeding studies in dogs, 30 and 90day studies in rats, and a
3week inhalation study in rats) also demonstrate cholinesterase (plasma, red blood cell or brain) inhibition
in rats and dogs. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing isophenphos on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical. 
Aquatic acute toxicity values for isofenphos include a daphnid 48hour EC

50

 of 1.6 ppb and a mysid 96hour EC

50

 of 1.7 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing isofenphos on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data. 143. 

Isophorone

 (CAS No. 000078-59-1) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Isophorone has been shown to cause neurotoxic effects in humans exposed
to atmospheric concentrations of 5 to 8 ppm. After being exposed for 1 month, workers complained of fatigue and malaise.
Neurotoxicity was also observed in humans following acute exposure. At 40 to 85 ppm, effects included nausea, headache,
dizziness, faintness, inebriation, and a feeling of suffocation. Increasing exposure concentrations resulted
in increasing severity of symptoms. Irritation and central nervous system (CNS) depression were observed at concentrations
of 200 to 400 ppm. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing isophorone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurotoxicity data for this chemical. 
144. 

Isophorone diisocyanate

 (CAS No. 004098-71-9) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). The 4hour inhalation LC

50

 value of isophorone diisocyanate in rats is 0.123 mg/L. The rat and mouse 3hour inhalation RD

50

 (50 percent reduction in respiratory rate) values are 0.0046 mg/L and 0.0019 mg/L, respectively. A 50year
old man developed severe asthma after exposure to an unspecified amount of paint containing isophorone diisocyanate.
A 1hour exposure to an unspecified amount of the compound caused eczema in three out of four workers. In addition,
isocyanates as a class are generally severe skin, eye and respiratory irritants. EPA's exposure analysis indicates
that isophorone diisocyanate concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of
continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant
adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing isophorone diisocyanate
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data
for this chemical. 
As detailed in Unit IV.B.132. of this preamble, as an alternative proposal to the individual listing of HDI, isophorone
diisocyanate, and 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), EPA is proposing to create a diisocyanates category
that includes HDI, isophorone diisocyanate, 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), and 16 other diisocyanates.

145. 

Lactofen (5-(2-chloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy)-2-nitro-2-ethoxy-1-methyl-2-oxoethyl ester)

 (CAS No. 077501-63-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Lactofen meets the criteria of an EPA Group B2 compound, i.e., a probable
human carcinogen. This conclusion was based on an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in males and
combined incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in both sexes of CD-1 mice following dietary administration
of lactofen. In CD rats, there was increased incidence of liver neoplastic nodules in both sexes. Four structurally
similar chemicals, acifluorfen, nitrofen, oxyfluorfen, and fomesafen, all produced hepatocellular tumors in
rodents. 
Results of several subchronic and chronic studies indicated the liver and kidney as target organs for lactofen. Increased
absolute and relative liver weight and hepatocytomegaly (the LOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was not determined)
were observed in male mice fed lactofen for 78 weeks. At 37.5 mg/kg/day, there was also an increased incidence of cataracts
and renal pigmentation. Based on the LOEL, an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day was derived. Renal dysfunction and decreased
hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and red blood cell counts (the LOEL was 25/75 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day)
were observed in a 1year feeding study in dogs. Increased renal and hepatic pigmentation (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day;
the NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day) were noted in a 2year feeding study in rats. In a 90day mouse study, increased
alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), and serum gleutanic pyruvic transaminase
(SGPT) activities, increased liver weight, hepatic necrosis, biliary hyperplasia, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin
levels and red blood cell counts, extramedullary hematopoiesis, and kidney nephrosis and fibrosis (the LOEL was
26 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was not determined) were seen. Decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, decreased red
blood cell counts, and brown pigment in the kidney and liver (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day) were noted in a 90day
feeding study in rats. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing lactofen on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data and hepatic, renal, and hematological toxicity data for
this chemical. 
146. 

Linuron

 (CAS No. 000330-55-2) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). The appearance of sulfhemoglobin in the blood of dogs, rats, or mice exposed
to linuron has been reported. In fact, available animal data from feeding studies of various durations (30 days to
2 years) with linuron as well as from studies with structurally similar urea-based herbicides indicate that the presence
of sulfhemoglobin (abnormal blood pigment) and morphological changes in red blood cells provide the most sensitive
indicator of exposure to linuron. In a 2year feeding study with beagle dogs, the LOAEL, based on the presence
of the sulfhemoglobin, was 0.625 mg/kg/day. This was the lowest dose tested. Red blood cell counts were decreased
in dogs exposed to higher doses of linuron. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day for linuron from this study.
Similar findings were reported in two separate 2year rat feeding studies. In one of these studies, the LOAEL
was 31.25 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 6.25 mg/kg/day. These values were based on spleen and bone marrow changes indicative
of hemolysis, and an increase in mortality and growth retardation. In the other 2year rat study, a LOAEL of 2.5
mg/kg/day (the lowest dose tested) was based on decreased red blood cell counts and reticulocytosis. Elevated sulfhemoglobin
levels were reported in rats exposed for as little as 30 days to 150 mg/kg/day. This exposure level also caused severe
growth retardation and increased mortality. The LOAEL for decreased body weight gain was 15 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL
was 3 mg/kg/day. Chronic administration of linuron at 4 mg/kg/day to rats caused hypochromic anemia, decreased cholinesterase
and peroxidase activities in the blood.
A LOAEL of 31.25 mg/kg/day was established in a 3generation reproductive toxicity study in which linuron (in
the diet) caused reduced weanling weights, reduced liver and kidney weights, liver atrophy, and reduced pup survival.
In a separate developmental toxicity study in rats administered linuron orally, a LOAEL of 31.25 mg/kg/day was based
on an increased incidence of fetal resorptions. The LOAEL for maternal toxicity in this study was 6.25 mg/kg/day (NOAEL
2.50 mg/kg/day), and was based on decreased food consumption and decreased body weight gain. An oral teratology study
in rabbits indicated a LOAEL of 5 mg/kg/day (lowest dose tested) based on decreased fetal body weight, decreased litter
size and an increase in skull malformations. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing linuron on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the hematological and developmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
147. 

Lithium carbonate

 (CAS No. 000554-13-2) (CAL) (Ref. 8). A major use of lithium carbonate is in the treatment of manic episodes of manic-depressive
illness. Decreases in the number of implantations, number of live fetuses and fetal body weight, and increases in
resorptions and various limb/skeletal anomalies were reported in the offspring of Wistar rats that received 100
mg/kg (the fetotoxic LOEL; the fetotoxic NOEL was 50 mg/kg) during gestation days 6 through 15. Offspring of mice that
received 465 mg/kg/day during gestation days 6 through 15 had increased craniofacial abnormalities. Fetal death
and reductions in litter size were also noted. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing lithium
carbonate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity
data for this chemical. 
148. 

Malathion

 (CAS No. 000121-75-5) (CERCLA) (Ref. 8). Malathion is a phosphorothioate insecticide. Its insecticidal properties
are due to cholinesterase inhibition. A 42year old woman ingested a minimum of 120 ml of a 50 percent solution
(approximately 850 mg/kg). She quickly became comatose, cyanotic, flaccid, devoid of tendon reflexes, and miotic.
Her serum cholinesterase activity was 22 percent of normal for 9 days and her red blood cell cholinesterase activity
was 10 to 25 percent of normal for 45 days. Thirty-five cases of poisoning by ingestion were reported in India. The symptoms
observed were cyanosis, excess salivation, pinpoint pupils, pulmonary edema, and electrocardiographic abnormalities;
all of which are indicative of cholinesterase inhibition. Autopsy of the fatalities indicated damage to the myocardium.
In a 56day study in which men were orally administered malathion, the NOEL for neurotoxic effects was 0.23 mg/kg/day
and the LOEL was 0.34 mg/kg/day. Plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase inhibition was observed at 0.34 mg/kg/day;
however, no clinical signs of overt toxicity were noted at this dose. Based on the NOEL, EPA has derived an oral RfD of
0.02 mg/kg/day for this chemical. Cholinesterase inhibition symptoms have also been observed in experimental animals
exposed to malathion. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing malathion on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical. 
Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for malathion include a 96hour LC

50

 of 68 ppb for rainbow trout, a 96hour LC

50

 of 51 ppb for sheepshead minnow, and a 96hour LC

50

 of 76 ppb for lake trout. In addition, the measured 48hour EC

50

 for daphnids is 0.9 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing malathion on EPCRA section 313
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
149. 

Man-made mineral fibers category

 (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Man-made mineral fibers are synthetic, amorphous (noncrystalline) fibers which consist of three
major groups: Glass fibers; mineral wool fibers (which includes mainly rock wool and slag wool); and refractory ceramic
fibers. Health concerns for these fibers are based on the morphological and toxicologic similarities with asbestos,
a known human carcinogen, causing lung cancer and mesotheliomas in humans and non-malignant respiratory diseases
(e.g. lung fibrosis). Injection studies, in which glass wool and glass microfibers were directly placed into the
respiratory airways, the pleural or abdominal cavities of laboratory animals, have shown consistent evidence of
carcinogenesis. Experimental studies have shown evidence of carcinogenesis by injection of rock wool and slag wool.
IARC has classified glass wool, rock wool, and slag wool fibers as Group 2B compounds, i.e., possible human carcinogens.
EPA has classified refractory ceramic fibers as Group B2 compounds, i.e., probable human carcinogen. EPA believes
that there is sufficient evidence for listing man-made mineral fibers as a category on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity data for these fibers. 
EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories, the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report is filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. 
EPA considered a number of options for listing man-made mineral fibers on EPCRA section 313. In 1977, the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended that exposures to fibers be limited to 3 fibers
per cubic centimeters (f/cc) for fibers that are less than 3.5 micrometers in diameter and longer than 10 micrometers
in length. NIOSH has since commented that in order to protect workers from lung cancer it will be necessary to lower
the exposure to 0.2 f/cc for fibrous glass. In 1992, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed
a 1 f/cc 8hour time-weighted average (TWA) limit for respirable fibers of fibrous glass, including refractory
ceramic fibers. Respirable fibers are generally defined as fibers with a diameter of less than 3.5 micrometers whose
length is at least 3 times the diameter (i.e., an aspect ratio (fiber length divided by fiber diameter) of 3 or greater).
In order to ease the burden of reporting, EPA considered listing fibers based on an aspect ratio that simply discriminates
between particles and fibers. This, however, seemed to be overly inclusive in that it would cover nonrespirable as
well as respirable fibers. EPA also considered using a diameter criteria without an aspect ratio but this option also
appears to be too inclusive since it may include particles as well as fibers. EPA is proposing to list man-made mineral
fibers as a category that includes glass microfibers, glass wool fibers, rock wool fibers, slag wool fibers, and refractory
ceramic fibers that have a diameter less than 3.5 micrometers and an aspect ratio greater than 3. This definition is
consistent with both the NIOSH and OSHA recommendations and is limited to fibers that are respirable. EPA requests
comment on this definition of man-made mineral fibers and any other options for defining a fibers category. 
150. 

Mecoprop

 (CAS No. 000093-65-2) (IARC) (Ref. 8). Mecoprop is a mono-chloro, mono-methylphenoxy isopropanoic acid type herbicide.
IARC has assigned mecoprop to Group 2B, i.e., it is possibly carcinogenic to humans. 
In several animal studies, changes in liver or kidney weights were the most sensitive indicators of mecoprop toxicity.
In a 90day rat feeding study, the LOAEL was 9 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day. At 26 mg/kg/day, the changes
in organ weights were accompanied by decreased glucose levels in males and increased creatinine levels in females.
EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.001 mg/kg/day from this study. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing mecoprop on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatic and renal toxicity data for this chemical. 
151. 

2-Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT)

 (CAS No. 000149-30-4) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). The 21day maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for daphnids
range from 240 to 470 ppb. The 60-day MATC for rainbow trout range from 41 to 78 ppb. EPA's exposure analysis indicates
that releases of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole will result in concentration levels that can reasonably be anticipated
to cause significant adverse environmental effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
2-mercaptobenzothiazole on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental
toxicity data and exposure data for this chemical. 152. 

Merphos

 (CAS No. 000150-50-5) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Merphos is a thiophosphate-type cholinesterase inhibitor. Delayed neurotoxic
effects have been reported in a 28-year old man following accidental exposure to the chemical over a period of 3 days.
Fourteen days later, he developed complete facial diplegia and decreased conduction velocity in his nerve fibers.
He recovered completely. Both immediate and delayed neurotoxic effects following exposure to merphos have been
reported in experimental animals. In a 3month hen feeding study the NOEL for neurotoxic effects was 0.1 mg/kg/day
and the LOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day. At 0.5 mg/kg, hens showed delayed neurotoxicity, ataxia, and equivocal changes in
the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.00003 mg/kg/day for this chemical.
In a 112-day rat feeding study, females showed red blood cell cholinesterase inhibition at the LOEL of 0.25 mg/kg/day.
The NOEL was 0.1 mg/kg/day. In a 90day rat feeding study, animals showed reduced brain cholinesterase activity
at the LOEL of 3.8 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 1.8 mg/kg/day. In a 90day dog feeding study, plasma cholinesterase
inhibition was observed at the LOEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.75 mg/kg/day. Fourteen cattle and 20 sheep administered
single doses of merphos (25 to 200 mg/kg) or 10 daily doses of merphos (2.5 mg/kg/day) showed emaciation, diarrhea,
and depression of blood cholinesterase. Ingested merphos is rapidly metabolized to n-butyl mercaptan within the
gastrointestinal tract. n-Butyl mercaptan has been shown to be responsible for the acute neurotoxic effects of merphos.
Thus, oral exposure to merphos is expected to cause acute neurotoxic symptoms while dermal exposure to merphos is
expected to cause delayed neurotoxic symptoms. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing merphos
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical.

153. 

Metham sodium (sodium methyldithiocarbamate)

 (CAS No. 000137-42-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Postimplanatation loss was observed in rabbits administered metham sodium
at 30 mg/kg/day (LOEL) on days 6 to 18 of gestation. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day (4.2 mg/kg/day based on active ingredient).
In rats fed metham sodium, increased variations, retardations, and anomalies were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day
(LOEL) administered on days 6 to 15. The NOEL was less than or equal to 10 mg/kg/day (less than or equal to 4.2 mg/kg/day
based on active ingredient). Although neither study was considered to be fully adequate due to study design and reporting
deficiencies, the weight of evidence indicates that metham sodium induces developmental toxicity. In addition,
metham sodium is metabolized to carbon disulfide, a potent developmental toxicant. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing metham sodium on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
developmental toxicity data for this chemical and its metabolite, carbon disulfide. 
154. 

Methazole (2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazolidine-3,5-dione)

 (CAS No. 020354-26-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Rabbits receiving 30 or 60 mg/kg/day by gavage on days 6 to 18 of gestation
exhibited increased embryolethality. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing methazole on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental
toxicity data for this chemical. 
155. 

Methiocarb

 (CAS No. 002032-65-7) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Measured terrestrial acute toxicity data for wildlife include
an oral LD

50

 of 4.6 mg/kg for red-winged blackbirds. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing methiocarb on
EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.

156. 

Methoxone ((4-Chloro-2-methylphenoxy) acetic acid) (MCPA)

 (CAS No. 000094-74-6) (FIFRA SR; IARC) (Ref. 8). Methoxone is a chlorophenoxy-type herbicide. Animal studies indicate
that the kidney and liver are the primary target organs of methoxone toxicity. Beagle dogs fed diets containing methoxone
for 1year developed liver toxicity, which was demonstrated by increased liver weights associated with alterations
in serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, bilirubin, triglyceride
and cholesterol levels. These effects occurred at doses of 0.75 mg/kg/day (LOAEL) and higher. The NOAEL was 0.15 mg/kg/day.
Kidney changes in the treated animals included deposition of kidney pigment in the proximal tubular epithelium (the
LOAEL was 0.75 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 0.15 mg/kg/day), and was accompanied by alterations in creatinine, urea,
and potassium levels. EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.0005 mg/kg/day from this study. Similar changes suggesting liver
and kidney toxicity were reported in another 90day dog feeding study (the LOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was
1 mg/kg/day) and in rats in a 90day feeding study (the LOAEL was 7.5 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day).

EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing methoxone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and renal toxicity data for this chemical. 
157. 

Methoxone sodium salt ((4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy) acetate sodium salt)

 (CAS No. 003653-48-3) (FIFRA SR; IARC) (Ref. 8). Methoxone sodium salt is a chlorophenoxy-type herbicide. Animal
studies indicate that the kidney and liver are the primary target organs of methoxone toxicity. Beagle dogs fed diets
containing methoxone for 1year developed liver toxicity, which was demonstrated by increased liver weights
associated with alterations in serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase, serum glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase,
bilirubin, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. These effects occurred at doses of 0.75 mg/kg/day (LOAEL) and higher.
The NOAEL was 0.15 mg/kg/day. Kidney changes in the treated animals included deposition of kidney pigment in the proximal
tubular epithelium (the LOAEL was 0.75 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 0.15 mg/kg/day), and was accompanied by alterations
in creatinine, urea, and potassium levels. EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.0005 mg/kg/day from this study. Similar changes
suggesting liver and kidney toxicity were reported in another 90day dog feeding study (the LOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day;
the NOAEL was 1 mg/kg/day) and in rats in a 90day feeding study (the LOAEL was 7.5 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 2.5
mg/kg/day). 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing methoxone sodium salt on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on its potential to cause cancer and on the available hepatic and renal toxicity
data for this chemical. 
158. 

1,1-Methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane)

 (CAS No. 005124-30-1) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). The 5hour rat inhalation LC

50

 value for 1,1-methylenebis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane) is 0.21 mg/L. The 3hour mouse inhalation RD

50

 (50 percent reduction in respiratory rate) value is 0.027 mg/L. In addition, isocyanates as a class are generally
severe skin, eye, and respiratory irritants. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that 1,1-methylenebis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane)
concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring
releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 1,1-methylenebis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane) on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this
chemical. 

As detailed in Unit IV.B.132. of this preamble, as an alternative proposal to the individual listing of HDI, isophorone
diisocyanate, and 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), EPA is proposing to create a diisocyanates category
that includes HDI, isophorone diisocyanate, 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane), and 16 other diisocyanates.


159. 

Methylene bis(thiocyanate)

 (CAS No. 006317-18-6) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). The minimal human lethal dose for methylene bis(thiocyanate) is 15 to 30
g (214 to 429 mg/kg), although fatalities have been reported at 300 mg (4.3 mg/kg). Clinical effects may include decreased
blood pressure, apnea, cerebral excitation, convulsions, coma, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, albuminuria,
skin rashes, exfoliative dermatitis, muscle weakness, goiter, and toxic psychosis. The intravenous mouse LD

50

 is 3.6 mg/kg. The subcutaneous rabbit DLo is 20 mg/kg; convulsions and lowered blood pressure were observed in this
study. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing methylene bis(thiocyanate) on EPCRA section 313
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical. 
160. 

Methyl isothiocyanate

 (CAS No. 00556-61-6) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Aquatic acute toxicity values for methyl isothiocyanate include a fish
96hour LC

50

 of 94 ppb, a 96hour LC

50

 of 130 ppb for bluegills, and a daphnid 48hour LC

50

 of 55 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing methyl isothiocyanate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data. 
161. 

2-Methyllactonitrile

 (CAS No. 000075-86-5) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). 2-Methyllactonitrile belongs to a class of
substances known as the cyanohydrins. Cyanohydrins are generally quite toxic because they can release hydrogen
cyanide. An oral dose of 5 mg/rat (approximately 14 mg/kg) of 2-methyllactonitrile administered twice weekly for
3 to 8 months produced liver and kidney lesions. Inhalation of 10.2 mg/L 
twice weekly for 3 to 8 months (duration of each individual exposure not reported) produced kidney lesions, desquamation
of the bronchial epithelium, and bronchial ulcerations. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
2-methyllactonitrile on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic toxic effects
to the liver, kidney, and bronchi caused by this chemical. 
162. 

N-Methylolacrylamide

 (CAS No. 000924-42-5) (CAL) (Ref. 8). There was clear evidence of carcinogenicity from N-methylolacrylamide in
a 2year study using B6C3F1 mice administered the substance by oral gavage. In both sexes, there were increased
incidences of Harderian gland adenomas or carcinomas, hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas, and alveolar or bronchiolar
adenomas and carcinomas. There was also an increase in ovarian granulosa cell tumors. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing N-methylolacrylamide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on
the carcinogenicity data for this chemical. 
163. 

Methyl parathion

 (CAS No. 000298-00-0) (CERCLA; FIFRA SR; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Methyl parathion is a thiophosphate-type cholinesterase
inhibitor. Methyl parathion is highly toxic when administered to experimental animals at low doses. The rat and mouse
oral LD

50

 values are reported to be 6.01 mg/kg and 18 mg/kg, respectively. The rat and mouse 4-hour inhalation LC

50

 values are reported to be 0.034 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, at which symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition
were observed. 
Human volunteers showed a 37 percent decrease in red blood cell cholinesterase activity following oral administration
of 0.43 mg/kg/day of methyl parathion for 10 days. The LOEL was 0.43 mg/kg/day and the NOEL was 0.31 mg/kg/day. In a 90day
dog feeding study, brain, red blood cell, and plasma cholinesterase inhibition was observed at the LOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day.
The NOEL was 0.3 mg/kg/day. In a chronic rat feeding study, plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase were inhibited
throughout the study and brain cholinesterase was depressed at the termination of the study at 2.5 mg/kg/day. The
NOEL for systemic toxicity was 0.025 mg/kg/day. An adequate NOEL for neurologic changes was not defined. Overt signs
of cholinergic toxicity (tremors, abnormal gait, alopecia) were observed in the animals at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day.
Histologic examination revealed evidence of peripheral neuropathy in animals administered this dose. EPA has derived
an oral RfD of 0.00025 mg/kg/day based on the systemic NOEL for this chemical. Hepatocellular swelling, degeneration,
and fatty change have been observed in humans acutely intoxicated with methyl parathion. Hepatocellular changes
were observed in patients that survived for 28 hours to 9 days after intoxication. Methyl parathion was orally administered
to rats in increasing doses for 36 days (starting with 0.37 mg/kg/day and increasing by a factor of 1.5 on every 4th day).
Weight loss, hyperglycemia, and macrocytic anemia, all secondary to hepatotoxicity, were observed. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing methyl parathion on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity and hepatic toxicity data for this chemical. Measured aquatic
acute toxicity data for methyl parathion include a 48hour EC

50

 of 0.14 ppb for daphnids and a 96hour LC

50

 of 15 ppb for crayfish. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing methyl parathion on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.

164. 

N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone

 (CAS No. 000872-50-4) (TSCA) (Ref. 8). In a 2generation reproductive study, there was evidence of reproductive
toxicity in the F

1

 generation after exposure to 50 mg/kg/day (LOAEL; no NOAEL was established). Exposure to 50 mg/kg/day or more resulted
in significant reductions in the male fertility index and in the female fecundity index. In addition, exposure to
500 mg/kg/day resulted in an increased incidence of dams with decreased corpora lutea. There was also evidence of
developmental toxicity in both generations after exposure to 500 mg/kg/day as demonstrated by reduced litter size,
reduced postnatal survival, and reduced pup weight. 
Maternal toxicity (significant reduction in mean body weight gain) was observed in rabbits receiving 175 mg/kg by
gavage on days 6 through 18 of gestation (The NOAEL was 55 mg/kg/day). Exposure to 540 mg/kg/day (LOAEL) resulted in
developmental toxicity as demonstrated by a significant increase in resorptions, and malformations (misshapen
skull bone and cardiovascular malformations). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 175 mg/kg/day. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing N-methylpyrrolidone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental and reproductive toxicity data for this chemical.

165. 

Methyltrichlorosilane

 (CAS No. 000075-79-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). As a class, chlorinated silanes are very corrosive to the skin and mucous
membranes and liberate hydrochloric acid in the presence of water. Methyltrichlorosilane causes severe burns and
the vapor is harmful to humans. The 2hour mouse inhalation LC

50

 value is 0.180 mg/L. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that methyltrichlorosilane concentrations are likely to
exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that
can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is
sufficient evidence for listing methyltrichlorosilane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A)
based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
166. 

Metiram

 (CAS No. 009006-42-2) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Metiram is an ethylene bisdithiocarbamate (EBDC) fungicide. Evidence
suggests that ethylene bisthiocarbamate fungicides and ethylenethiourea (a common contaminant, metabolite,
and degradation product of these fungicides) cause cancer and adverse developmental effects in experimental animals.
In a 2year diet study, ethylenethiourea caused liver adenomas and carcinomas in mice, and thyroid follicular
cell adenomas and carcinomas in mice and rats. A NOAEL of less than or equal to 5 mg/kg has been reported for ethylenethiourea,
based on a rat developmental toxicity study. Ethylenethiourea caused delayed ossification or hardening of the parietal
bone in pups. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing metiram on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity and developmental toxicity data for ethylenethiourea, a metabolite
and degradation product of metiram. 
In Unit IV.B.172. of this preamble, EPA is proposing to add another ethylene bisdithiocarbamate (EBDC), nabam. An
additional two EBDCs, zineb and maneb, are currently individually listed on the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals.
The category of EBDCs has recently been added to EPCRA section 313 (December 1, 1993, 58 FR 63500). EPA requests comment
on the following: (1) Should the individual EBDCs, metiram and nabam, be added individually to EPCRA section 313 even
though they are members of the EBDC category, which is listed on EPCRA section 313; and (2) should the individual listings
for two EBDCs, zineb and maneb, be deleted and added as members of the newly created EBDC category. 
167. 

Metribuzin

 (CAS No. 021087-64-5) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a rabbit teratology study, the NOEL for maternal and fetotoxicity was
15 mg/kg/day, and the LOEL was 45 mg/kg/day. Developmental effects including irregular spinus process and decreased
pup body weight were observed in rats treated with metribuzin (Sencor) during gestation day 7 to 19 at 85 mg/kg/day
(LOEL). The NOEL for developmental toxicity was 30 mg/kg/day. The LOEL and NOEL for maternal toxicity were 30 and 10
mg/kg/day, respectively. 
In a 2year dog feeding study, adverse effects observed at 1,500 ppm (37.5 mg/kg/day; LOEL) included weight
reduction, increased mortality, hematologic changes, and liver/kidney damage. The systemic NOEL was 100 ppm (2.5
mg/kg/day). In a 2year rat feeding study, decreased weight gain, mortality, and pathological changes in the
liver and kidney were observed at 300 ppm (15 mg/kg/day). The NOEL was 100 ppm (5 mg/kg/day). 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing metribuzin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic, renal, and developmental toxicity data for this chemical. 168. 

Mevinphos

 (CAS No. 007786-34-7) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Measured aquatic acute toxicity values for mevinphos include
a 96hour LC

50

 of 70 ppb for bluegills, and a 96hour LC

50

 of 0.16 ppb for daphnids. Measured acute avian toxicity data include a pheasant oral LD

50

 of 1.37 mg/kg, a mallard duck oral LD

50

 of 4.63 mg/kg, and a sharp-tailed grouse oral LD

50

 of 1.34 mg/kg. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing mevinphos on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
169. 

Molinate (1H-azepine-1-carbothioic acid, hexahydro-S-ethyl ester)

 (CAS No. 002212-67-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref 3). In a rat developmental toxicity study, adverse effects observed following
administration of molinate at 35 mg/kg/day (LOEL) included increased post-implantation loss, lower fetal body
weight, increased incidence of runts, and external/soft tissue/skeletal variants; the NOEL was 2.2 mg/kg. In a rabbit
developmental study, adverse effects such as an increase in the number of abortions, and a decrease in the number of
females with live fetuses were noted at 200 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. The developmental effects were observed
at levels which were toxic to maternal animals. 
In a rat fertility test, reductions in fertility, dose-related altered sperm morphology, and a reduction in the number
of viable fetuses were observed following administration of molinate. The NOEL was 0.2 mg/kg/day and the LOEL was
4 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL of the study, an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day was derived. In a 90day study in male
rats, the lowest toxic oral dose of 324 mg/kg produced adverse effects on spermatogenesis, male fertility, and viability
index. The 20day inhalation male rat lowest-toxic contentration (TCLo) is 0.0006 mg/L. At this exposure level
adverse effects on spermatogenesis and male fertility index were reported. In a 2-generation rat reproduction study,
the reproductive NOEL was 0.3 mg/kg/day, and the LOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day based on reduced fecundity and increased incidence
of ovarian vacuolation/hypertrophy. In a 3month rat inhalation study, testicular degeneration and abnormal
spermatozoa were observed at 0.002 mg/L (LOEL). No NOEL was determined. 
In a 2year study in rats fed molinate, adverse effects seen at 0.35 mg/kg/day included degeneration and demyelination
of the sciatic nerve and skeletal muscle atrophy/reserve cell hyperplasia; no NOEL was determined. In a 1year
study in dogs administered molinate orally, adverse effects observed at 50 mg/kg/day included anemia, loss of ability
to bark, ataxia, splayed hind limbs, vacuolation of the medulla, demyelination of the pons and spinal cord, tremors,
and eosinophilic bodies in the nervous system. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing molinate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental, reproductive, and neurological toxicity data for this chemical.

170. 

Monuron

 (CAS No. 000150-68-5) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). The measured aquatic toxicity data for monuron include a 1.5-hour EC

50

 of 90 ppb and a 10-day EC

50

 of 100 ppb for marine algae. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing monuron on EPCRA section 313
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
171. 

Myclobutanil (alpha-butyl-alpha-(4-chlorophenyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-propanenitrile)

 (CAS No. 088671-89-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Hepatocellular hypertrophy (the LOEL was 5.9 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.3
mg/kg/day) was seen in a 90day feeding study in dogs. In another 90day feeding study, hepatocellular
necrosis and hypertrophy (the LOEL was 147.2 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 49.1 mg/kg/day) were observed in rats. Hepatocellular
hypertrophy (the LOEL was 14.3 mg/kg/day in males and 15.7 mg/kg/day in females; the NOEL was 3.1 mg/kg/day in males
and 3.83 mg/kg/day in females) was noted in a 1year feeding study in dogs. Hepatic effects (centrilobular hepatocytic
hypertrophy, kupffer cell pigmentation, periportal vacuolation and altered foci) were observed in mice fed 75 mg/kg/day
myclobutanil for 2 years. At 15 mg/kg/day, increased liver mixed function oxidase (the NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day) was also
seen. 
Testicular atrophy (the LOEL was 9.84 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 2.49 mg/kg/day) was observed in a 2year chronic
feeding study in rats. The seminiferous tubules were frequently devoid of spermatid formation and germinal epithelial
cells. Based on the NOEL, an oral RfD of 0.025 mg/kg/day was derived. Testicular atrophy (the LOEL was 46.4 mg/kg/day;
the NOEL was 9.28 mg/kg/day) was also noted in a 2-generation reproduction study.
In a developmental toxicity study in rats, increased resorption and decreased viability were observed at 93.8 mg/kg/day
(LOEL). The NOEL was 31.3 mg/kg/day. In a developmental toxicity study in rabbits, an increased number of resorptions
per litter, reduced viability index, and reduced litter size were observed at 200 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 60
mg/kg/day.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing myclobutanil on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic, reproductive, and developmental toxicity data for this chemical.

172. 

Nabam

 (CAS No. 000142-59-6) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Nabam is an ethylene bisthiocarbamate fungicide. Evidence suggests that
ethylene bisthiocarbamate fungicides and ethylenethiourea (a common contaminant, metabolite, and degradation
product of these fungicides) cause cancer and adverse developmental effects in experimental animals. In a 2year
diet study ethylenethiourea caused liver adenomas and carcinomas in mice, and thyroid follicular cell adenomas
and carcinomas in mice and rats. A NOAEL of less than or equal to 5 mg/kg has been reported for ethylenethiourea, based
on a rat developmental toxicity study. Ethylenethiourea caused delayed ossification or hardening of the parietal
bone in pups. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nabam on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity and developmental toxicity data for ethylenethiourea, a metabolite
and degradation product of nabam.
173. 

Naled

 (CAS No. 000300-76-5) (CERCLA; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Naled is an organophosphate-type cholinesterase inhibitor.
In a human acute poisoning case, toxic symptoms included abdominal cramps, hypersecretion, emesis, perspiration,
anxiety, vertigo and horizontal nystagmus, and persisted for 4 months. In a 2year rat feeding study the NOEL
for neurotoxic effects was 0.2 mg/kg/day and the LOEL was 2.0 mg/kg/day. It was observed in this study that, at 2.0 mg/kg/day,
brain cholinesterase activity was inhibited by approximately 24 percent. At 10.0 mg/kg/day, brain cholinesterase
activity was inhibited by approximately 60 percent, and both plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase were also inhibited.
Based on the NOEL, EPA has an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day for this chemical. In a 1-year feeding study using dogs as the
test species, plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase activity were inhibited at 2.0 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.2
mg/kg/day and the LOEL was 2.0 mg/kg/day.
In a 2-generation reproduction study of naled in rats, the NOEL was 6 mg/kg/day. At 18 mg/kg/day, decreased litter
size, survival, and pup body weight were observed.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing naled on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on the chronic neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity data for this chemical.
Measured aquatic acute toxicity values for naled include a 48hour EC

50

 of 0.35 ppb for daphnids and a 96hour LC

50

 of 87 ppb for lake trout. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing naled on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
174. 

Nicotine and salts

 (CAL; CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA AI; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Nicotine salts will dissociate in aqueous solutions
to yield soluble nicotine. Nicotine is highly toxic in humans. The estimated lethal oral dose in adults is approximately
40 to 60 mg. The onset of toxicity is rapid. Symptoms include nausea, salivation, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea,
headache, weakness, sweating, and confusion. Nicotine markedly stimulates the central nervous system, causing
tremors and convulsions. The stimulation is followed by depression, and death resulting from paralysis of respiratory
muscles. Nicotine can also activate parasympathetic ganglia and cholinergic nerve endings resulting in gastrointestinal
hyperactivity.
Skeletal defects and occasional cleft palates were observed in mice injected with 25 mg/kg nicotine on gestation
days 9 to 11. Reduced size in the newborn of rats and limb deformities in the offspring of swine were reported in swine
and rats following oral exposure to 1,058 ppm nicotine (approximately 53 mg/kg/day). Deformities were found in some
rabbit fetuses when dams were administered nicotine at a dose of 20 mg/kg 5 times during pregnancy. Pregnant swine
fed aqueous leaf extracts of tobacco at the rate of 16 and 32 mg/kg nicotine produced arthrogrypotic newborn pigs.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nicotine and its salts as a category on EPCRA section 313
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for these substances. EPCRA section
313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals in the category
manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members of a chemical
category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing threshold for
that category. When filing reports for chemical categories, the releases are determined in the same manner as the
thresholds. One report if filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. 
175. 

Nitrapyrin (2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine)

 (CAS No. 001929-82-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 1year study in dogs fed nitrapyrin adverse effects noted included
increased cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase, increased absolute and relative liver weight and panlobular/centrilobular
hepatocellular hypertrophy. The NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day and the LOEL was 15 mg/kg/day. In a 10week reproductive
rat study, adverse effects observed included increased incidence of fetal liver hypertrophy and vacuolization
at 75 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. In a 90day rat feeding study, hepatocellular fatty change
and necrosis, renal tubule epithelial cell swelling and increasingly severe interstitial nephritis were observed
at 50 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 15 mg/kg/day. In a 2year rat feeding study, an increase in glomerulonephropathy
was observed in males dosed with 60 mg/kg/day and an increase in hepatic hypertrophy and vacuolization was observed
in males and females dosed with 60 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. 
Increased incidence of crooked hyoid bone and craniofacial abnormalities were observed in the offspring of rabbits
orally administered nitrapyrin at 30 mg/kg/day (LOEL) on days 6 through 18 of gestation. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day.
Decreased weight and hypertrophy and vacuolization of the liver were observed in offspring of rats dosed with 75 mg/kg/day
(LOEL) for 10 weeks prior to mating. The NOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
nitrapyrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available renal, hepatic, and
developmental toxicity data for this chemical.
176. 

Nitrate ion

 (CAS No. 014797-55-8) (SDWA) (Ref. 8). Nitrate refers to the nitrate ion (NO

3



-

). Infantile methemoglobinemia occurs in human infants exposed to aqueous solutions of nitrate ion and can progress
to cyanosis and death. Based on numerous epidemiological and clinical studies, EPA has determined a LOAEL of 1.8 to
3.2 mg/kg/day and a NOAEL and RfD of 1.6 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 10 mg/L nitrate-nitrogen or 44 mg/L nitrate ion
in drinking water. Infants weighing an average of 4 kg (0 to 3 months of age) are the most sensitive population to nitrate-induced
methemoglobinemia. This is primarily due to their higher stomach pH which favors the growth of nitrate-reducing
bacteria, the immaturity of their metabolic enzyme systems, and reduced capacity of their erythrocytes to reduce
methemoglobin to hemoglobin. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nitrate ion on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological toxicity data for this chemical.

In nitrogen-limited waters, nitrates have the potential to cause increased algal growth leading to eutrophication
in the aquatic environment. (Nitrate-nitrogen is the form of nitrogen most available to plants.) Studies of estuarine
water at several locations along the eastern coast of the United States have indicated that low concentrations of
dissolved nitrogen (e.g., nitrate) limit primary production of plants. 
Additions of nitrate to such estuarine systems stimulate primary production of plants and can produce changes in
the dominant species of plants, leading to cultural eutrophication and ultimately to deterioration of water quality,
including algal blooms.
It has been determined that lakes with a spring maximum concentration of more than 300 ug/L of inorganic nitrogen (e.g.,
nitrates) could be expected to have algal nuisances in the summer. 
Toxic effects result from oxygen depletion as the algae die and decay. Toxic effects have also been related to the release
of decay products or direct excretion of toxic substances from sources such as blue-green algae. EPA believes that
there is sufficient evidence for listing nitrate ion on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C)
based on the available environmental toxicity data. 
177. 

Nitric oxide

 (CAS No. 010102-43-9) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). The acute toxicity of nitric oxide has been rated
high. Nitric oxide causes death or permanent injury after very short exposure to small quantities. Exposure to nitric
oxide can result in acute and chronic changes of the pulmonary system including pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, bronchitis,
bronchiolitis, emphysema, and methemoglobinemia. Neurologic effects (fatigue, restlessness, anxiety, mental
confusion, lethargy, loss of consciousness) have also been reported. The effects of nitric oxide may be related to
the formation of methemoglobin. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nitric oxide on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological and hematological toxicity
data for this chemical. 
178. 

p-Nitroaniline

 (CAS No. 000100-01-6) (CERCLA; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). In a 14day study in mice fed p-nitroaniline in doses
as low as 10 mg/kg, 5 days per week, methemoglobin concentrations were found to be significantly higher than those
in control animals. In the same study, hematocrit values in mice that received 300 mg/kg, and total erythrocyte counts
in mice that received 100 or 300 mg/kg, were significantly lower than those of control animals. Similar effects were
observed in 13week and 2year mouse studies. In the 2year study, lesions related to the administration
of p-nitroaniline occurred in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow (primarily in mice receiving 30 or 100 mg/kg) and
were observed at 9 and 15 months. In addition, increases in the incidence or severity of splenic congestion, hematopoiesis,
pigment (hemosiderin) accumulation, Kupffer cell pigmentation in the liver, and bone marrow hypercellularity
(hyperplasia). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing p-nitroaniline on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic toxicity data for this chemical.
179. 

Nitrogen dioxide

 (CAS No. 010102-44-0) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Acid precipitation occurs in large regions
of the Eastern United States and Canada, Europe, and Japan. This widespread occurrence of acid precipitation and
dry deposition results in large part from man-made emissions of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen (e.g., nitrogen dioxide).
These substances are transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric acid and nitric acid, transported over great distances
and deposited on vegetation, soils, surface waters, and materials. These substances are transferred from the atmosphere
into ecosystems by the absorption of gases, the impaction and gravitational settling of fine aerosols and coarse
particles, and precipitation. 
Acids contained in polluted snow are released as contaminated meltwater. The resulting release of pollutants can
cause major or rapid changes in the acidity of streams and lake waters. Interference with normal reproduction in fish
populations is induced by acidity of lake and stream waters. Reproduction of frogs and salamanders is also inhibited
by atmospheric acidification of surface waters. 
Atmospheric deposition of sulfuric acid and nitric acid can cause serious damage to crops and forests. Biological
effects include induction of necrotic lesions, loss of nutrients due to leaching from foliar organs, accelerated
erosion of waxes and leaf surfaces, and interference with normal reproductive processes. Acidification also decreases
the rate of many soil processes such as nitrogen fixation and the breakdown of organic matter. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing nitrogen dioxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 

Nitrogen dioxide is regulated under Title I of the CAA (Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance of National Ambient
Air Quality Standards). In addition to this proposal to add nitrogen dioxide to EPCRA section 313, in Units IV.B.36.
and 235, EPA is proposing to add two other chemicals, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide, that are regulated by Title
I of the CAA. Sulfur dioxide is also regulated by Title IV of the CAA (Acid Deposition Control). Extensive data, which
are highly technical, are collected on these chemicals as required by the CAA. EPA requests comment on the following:
(1) Is the information collected under the CAA sufficient for public right-to-know purposes; and (2) suggestions
on how the data collected on these chemicals pursuant to CAA Titles I and IV could be used to meet the purposes of EPCRA
section 313.

Norflurazon (4-Chloro-5-(methylamino)-2-[3(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3(2H)-pyridazinone)

 (CAS No. 027314-13-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Congestion of the liver, hepatocyte swelling and increased liver weights,
and increase in colloid vacuole in the thyroid were observed in dogs fed 450 ppm (10.25 mg/kg/day) norflurazon for
6 months. The NOEL was 150 ppm (3.75 mg/kg/day). An oral RfD of 0.04 mg/kg/day has been determined. Increased relative
liver weight and hypertrophy of the thyroid with depletion of colloid were seen in rats fed 2,500 ppm (125 mg/kg/day)
norflurazon for 90 days. The NOEL was 500 ppm (25 mg/kg/day). Hepatic hyperplasia and hypertrophy and increased relative
liver weight were noted in a 28day feeding study in rats. The LOEL was 1,000 ppm (50 mg/kg/day) and the NOEL was
500 ppm (25 mg/kg/day). Increased relative liver weight and diffuse and smooth granular livers were seen in a 28day
feeding study in mice. The LOEL was 2,520 ppm (328 mg/kg/day) and the NOEL was 420 ppm (55 mg/kg/day). EPA believes that
there is sufficient evidence for listing norflurazon on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on the available hepatic and thyroid toxicity data.

increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and alkaline phosphatase and SGPT, anemia, hepatic changes, splenic hematopoiesis
and hyperplastic bone marrow were observed in dogs fed 56.25 mg/kg/day (the NOEL was 18.75 mg/kg/day) for 3 months.
Increases in serum cholesterol levels, alkaline phosphatase activity, and relative liver and kidney weights and
decreases in alanine transaminase (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day) were observed in dogs fed oryzalin
for 1year. Decreased red blood cell count and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels (LOEL was 45 mg/kg/day; NOEL
was 15 mg/kg/day) were noted in a 1-year feeding study in rats. In a 2year feeding study in rats, decreased red
blood cell count and hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, and increased BUN and liver and kidney weights (the LOEL was
45 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 15 mg/kg/day) were observed. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
oryzalin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and hematological

Oxydemeton methyl (S-(2-(Ethylsulfinyl)ethyl) O,O-dimethyl ester phosphorothioic acid)

 (CAS No. 000301-12-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Two multigeneration reproduction studies indicate a variety of reproductive
effects at 2.1 to 2.5 mg/kg/day. These effects include decreased litter size and viability, decreased weight of the
testes and ovaries, and increased epididymal vacuolation. The NOELs were 0.38 and 0.5 mg/kg/day. A NOEL of 0.9 mg/kg/day
was determined in a 5day study in the rat. The LOEL for decreased fertility and epididymal sperm motility was
5 mg/kg/day.
Oxydemeton methyl can cause inhibition of brain, plasma, and red blood cell cholinesterase. In a 2-generation reproduction
study, statistically significant inhibition of red blood cell and brain cholinesterase activity (the NOEL was less
than 0.043 mg/kg/day) was observed in adult males and females of the F

0

 and F

1

 generations. In a 5day feeding (dominant lethal plus) study, inhibition of plasma cholinesterase activity
(the LOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.45 mg/kg/day) was observed. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence

the available developmental, hepatic, and renal toxicity data for this chemical.
184. 

Oxyfluorfen

 (CAS No. 042874-03-3) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Oxyfluorfen is a phenoxyphenyl-type herbicide. Several chronic oral
toxicity studies suggest that oxyfluorfen may be hepatotoxic. Hepatic effects (e.g. increased absolute liver weight,
necrosis, regeneration, and hyperplastic nodules) were observed in mice fed diets containing greater than 3 mg/kg/day
oxyfluorfen for 20 months (the NOEL was 0.3 mg/kg/day). Based on these findings, an oral RfD value of 0.003 mg/kg/day
was derived. This study was supported by other chronic feeding studies that demonstrated increases in liver weight,
alkaline phosphatase activity, and bile pigmented hepatocytes (the LOEL was 15 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day)
in dogs, and minimal hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes (the LOEL was 40 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day)
in rats. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing oxyfluorfen on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatotoxic effects of this chemical.
The estimated chronic MATC values for fish and daphnids are 9 ppb and 20 ppb oxyfluorfen, respectively. The estimated
log K

ow

 is 6.1. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing oxyfluorfen on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA

185. 

Ozone

 (CAS No. 010028-15-6) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Information from a large number of studies of both humans and animals indicate
that ozone can affect structure, function, metabolism, pulmonary defense against bacterial infection, and extrapulmonary
effects. Among these extrapulmonary effects are: (1) Cardiovascular effects; (2) reproductive and teratological
effects; (3) central nervous system effects; (4) alterations in red blood cell morphology; (5) enzymatic activity;
and (6) cytogenetic effects on circulating lymphocytes. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
ozone on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available toxicity data for this chemical.

Effects of ozone on green plants include injury to foliage, reductions in growth, losses in yield, alterations in
reproductive capacity, and alterations in susceptibility to pests and pathogens. Based on the known interrelationships
of different components of ecosystems, such effects, if of sufficient magnitude, may potentially lead to irreversible
changes of sweeping nature to ecosystems. 
Measured aquatic acute toxicity values for ozone include a 96hour LC

50

 of 80 ppb for striped bass, a 96hour LC

50

 of 30 ppb for channel catfish, and a 96hour LC

50

 of 9.3 ppb for rainbow trout. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing ozone on EPCRA section 313

186. 

Paraquat dichloride

 (CAS No. 001910-42-5) (EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Paraquat can cause death in humans as a consequence of severe
injury to the lungs, or as a result of kidney, liver, or heart failure. Following exposure, death may occur in 24 hours
or less. The acute oral LD

50

 values for paraquat are reported as 57, 120, 25, 50 and 35 mg/kg in the rat, mouse, dog, monkey, and cat, respectively.
Chronic pneumonitis (the LOEL was 0.93 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.45 mg/kg/day) was reported in dogs fed diets containing
paraquat dichloride for 52 weeks. These results are supported by the results of a 2year feeding study in rats
(the LOEL was 3.75 mg/kg/day based on nonneoplastic lung lesions; the NOEL was 1.25 mg/kg/day) and a 90day feeding
study in dogs (the LOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day based on increased lung weight, alveolitis, and alveolar collapse; the NOEL
was 0.5 mg/kg/day).
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing paraquat dichloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA

lesions (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 12.5 mg/kg/day) were observed in dogs fed pendimethalin for 2 years.
EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.04 mg/kg/day. Hypertrophy of the liver and increased liver weights were observed in rats
fed 5,000 ppm (250 mg/kg/day) for 3 months. The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing pendimethalin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic
toxicity data.
189. 

Pentobarbital sodium

 (CAS No. 000057-33-0) (CAL) (Ref. 8). Pentobarbital sodium is commonly used as a sedative hypnotic. The average adult
sedative dose is 20 to 40 mg orally. The average adult hypnotic dose is 100 to 200 mg orally. Pentobarbital is also used
parenterally or rectally to provide basal hypnosis for general, spinal, or regional anesthesia. Like other barbiturates,
a common adverse effect to using pentobabital sodium is central nervous system depression. Chronic exposure to pentobarbital
sodium may lead to psychological and physical dependence.
Intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg on day 1 of pregnancy produced adverse effects on fertility in rats. Intraperitoneal
injections of 80 mg/kg to rats on day 1 of pregnancy caused preimplantation loss. Intraperitoneal injection of 94.5
mg/kg on day 2 of pregnancy decreased fertility and caused fetal death in rats. Intraperitoneal injection of 22 mg/kg
on day 10 of pregnancy caused adverse effects in rat fetuses (details of study not reported). Subcutaneous injection
of 520 mg/kg of pentobarbital sodium on days 9 to 21, or administration of 30 mg/kg on day 19 of pregnancy produced abnormal
behavioral effects in rat offspring. Exposure to pentobarbital sodium during pregnancy can cause fetal addiction
to the substance.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing pentobarbital sodium on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental, reproductive, and chronic neurological toxicity data for
this chemical.

Perchloromethyl mercaptan

 (CAS No. 000594-42-3) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). The rat oral LD

50

 and 4hour rat inhalation LC

50

 values for perchloromethyl mercaptan are 8.26 mg/kg and 0.26 mg/L, respectively. The 2hour mouse inhalation
LC

50

 value is reported to be 0.296 mg/L. In an eye irritation test, 50 micrograms (

m

g) (0.13 mg/kg/day) placed in a rabbit's eye for 24 hours produced a severe reaction. EPA's exposure analysis indicates
that perchloromethyl mercaptan concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result
of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant
adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing perchloromethyl
mercaptan on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure
data for this chemical.

198. 

Phenytoin

 (CAS No. 000057-41-0) (CAL; IARC; NTP) (Ref. 8). Phenytoin is a hydantoin-type anticonvulsant, and is used mainly
in the prophylactic management of tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures and partial seizures with complex symptomatology.
In doses used to treat seizure disorders (i.e., 300 mg/day in adults, 5 mg/kg/day in children) phenytoin can cause
adverse effects such as constipation, dysphagia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss. Ingestion of 4.5 g
(64 mg/kg/day) by adults and 0.6 g (60 mg/kg/day) by children has produced transient coma with motor restlessness.
Ingestion of 11 mg/kg/day produced changes in motor activity in a child (duration of study not reported). Oral administration
of 7.8 mg/kg/day for 4 days produced encephalitis, hallucinations, and irritability in a man. Ingestion of 7.6 mg/kg/day
for 2 weeks caused encephalitis, hallucinations, and ataxia in a woman.
Phenytoin is classified as a Group 2B compound by IARC; i.e., possible human carcinogen. Ingestion of 16.5 mg/kg/day
for 1year produced lymphoma including Hodgkin's disease and skin tumors in a child. Oral exposure to phenytoin
produced lymphoma in mice (doses and duration of study not reported).
Oral administration of 5.9 mg/kg/day to a woman for the first 39 weeks of pregnancy induced kidney tumors in the offspring.
In another study, oral administration of 5.9 mg/kg/day to a woman for the first 39 weeks of pregnancy induced brain
tumors in the offspring. Oral administration of 2 mg/kg/day to a woman for 1year produced lymphoma including
Hodgkin's disease. Congenital malformation was reported in 6.12 percent of births to 98 epileptic mothers receiving
phenytoin regularly during the first 4 months of pregnancy. Hypothrombinemia and hemorrhage has occurred in newborns
of mothers who received phenytoin during pregnancy. Oral doses of 4.0 to 5.9 mg/kg/day administered to women for the
first 39 weeks of pregnancy produced craniofacial abnormalities, nervous system disorders, and delayed physical
effects in their children. Doses of 2.0 mg/kg/day given to a woman for the first 39 weeks of pregnancy produced abnormalities
of skin, appendages, and musculoskeletal system in her child as well as other developmental abnormalities. Oral
doses of 5.0 mg/kg/day produced biochemical and metabolic abnormalities in the offspring. Higher doses of phenytoin
(130 mg/kg/day) orally administered to rats produced behavioral, growth, musculoskeletal, and nervous system
abnormalities in the offspring. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing phenytoin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurological and developmental toxicity data and on the carcinogenicity data
for this chemical. 
199. 

Phosphine

 (CAS No. 007803-51-2) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Available data on phosphine indicate that its inhalation LC

50

 for rats is between 4 and 40 ppm (the exposure time was 4 hours). Phosphine is a highly-toxic gas with a probable oral
lethal dose of 5 mg/kg. An air concentration of 3 ppm is safe for long-term exposure, 500 ppm is lethal in 30 minutes,
and a concentration of 1,000 ppm is lethal after a few breaths. 
EPA's exposure analysis indicates that phosphine concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries,
as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause
significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing phosphine
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data
for this chemical.
200. 

Phosphorus oxychloride

 (CAS No. 010025-87-3) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS) (Refs. 5 and 8). Phosphorus oxychloride reacts with water to yield phosphoric
acid and hydrochloric acid.
Phosphoric acid, as well as other phosphates, have the potential to cause increased algal growth leading to eutrophication
in the aquatic environment.
Eutrophication may result when nutrients, especially phosphates, enter into an aquatic ecosystem in the presence
of sunlight and nitrogen. The phosphate ion is a plant nutrient, which can be a major limiting factor for plant growth
in freshwater environments. In excess, phosphates can cause algal blooms. Toxic effects result from oxygen depletion
as the algae die and decay. Toxic effects have also been related to the release of decay products or direct excretion
of toxic substances from sources such as blue-green algae.
Laboratory studies indicate that eutrophication may occur at phosphate concentrations as low as 50 ppb in lakes.
The resulting oxygen depletion and toxic decay products (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) kill many invertebrates and fish.
Although green algae are more sensitive to growth stimulation by phosphates in fresh water, blue-green algal blooms
may cause greater damage. At least three species of blue-green algae are known to excrete toxins. Secretion by cyanobacteria
of dyalyzable metabolites have inhibited the growth of other species of algae and may result in algal monoculture.
When algal blooms of these toxic species occur in a reservoir, lake, slough, or pond, the cells and toxins can become
sufficiently concentrated to cause illness or death in invertebrates and vertebrates. Major losses have been reported
for cattle, sheep, hogs, birds (domestic or wild) and fishes, minor losses for dogs, horses, small wild animals, amphibians,
and invertebrates.
Eutrophication may occur in slow moving rivers, but is less likely in swift rivers where rapid mixing occurs. Light
is the most important limiting factor because rivers are murkier than lakes thus, the chances of eutrophication in
swift rivers are slight. However, lakes and reservoirs collect phosphates from influent streams and store a fraction
of them within consolidated sediments, thus serving as a phosphate sink. 
The available information derived from animal and controlled human studies clearly indicates that exposure to acid
aerosols can produce health effects of concern, particularly in sensitive subgroups of the population and after
chronic exposure. The bulk of these studies, however, have examined sulfuric acid exposures. Data for other acid
species and mixtures are extremely limited. However, as the effects appear to be due to the acidity of the species,
this data should pertain to acid aerosols consisting of other mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid. The effects
seen range from mild and transient changes, such as small, reversible functional effects in exercising asthmatics,
to more substantial effects that may have acute or chronic health consequences, such as persistently altered clearance
and structural changes that may be suggestive of chronic lung disease. In addition, there are some notable consistencies
in the health effects information across various studies and disciplines.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing phosphorous oxychloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA sections 313(d)(2)(B) and (C) based on the available chronic human and environmental toxicity data for its
degradation products phoshoric acid and hydrochloric acid.

As described in Unit IV.B.200. of this preamble, phosphates, including phosphoric acid, have the potential to cause
increased algal growth leading to eutrophication and fish kills in the aquatic environment.
Acute exposures to large amounts of hydrogen sulfide (approximately 250 ppm or more) have produced pulmonary edema,
unconsciousness, respiratory paralysis, asphyxiation, and/or death in some individuals. Similar effects are
also noted in animals. In a subchronic study, inflammation of the nasal mucosa occurred in mice following 90day
inhalation of hydrogen sulfide, resulting in a NOAEL of 42.5 mg/m

3

 (30.5 ppm; Human Equivalent Concentration (HEC) is 0.93 mg/m

3

) and a LOAEL of 110 mg/m

3

 (80 ppm; HEC is 2.4 mg/m

3

). Other respiratory effects, such as alveolar edema, infiltrates in the bronchioles, cellular necrosis, hyperplasia,
and exfoliation in various respiratory tissues, have been reported in rats.
Aquatic toxicity test data for hydrogen sulfide show that measured fish 96hour LC

50

 values range from 7 to 776 ppb.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing phosphorus pentasulfide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA sections 313(d)(2)(B) and (C) based on the available chronic human and environmental toxicity data for its
degradation products, phosphoric acid and hydrogen sulfide.

Phosphorus pentoxide

 (CAS No. 001314-56-3) (EPCRA EHS) (Refs. 5 and 8). Phosphorus pentoxide rapidly hydrolyzes in the presence of water
to yield phosphoric acid.
As described in Unit IV.B.200. of this preamble, phosphates, including phosphoric acid, have the potential to cause
increased algal growth leading to eutrophication and fish kills in the aquatic environment. EPA believes that there
is sufficient evidence for listing phosphorous pentoxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C)
based on the available environmental toxicity data for its degradation product phosphoric acid.
204. 

Picloram

 (CAS No. 001918-02-1) (FIFRA AI; SDWA) (Ref. 8). Animal studies in dogs, rats, or mice for various durations (2 weeks
to 2 years) have indicated the liver as the primary target of picloram toxicity. In a 6month feeding study in
beagle dogs, a LOAEL of 35 mg/kg/day and a NOAEL of 7 mg/kg/day were determined for increased liver weights (relative
and absolute). At a higher dose (175 mg/kg/day), there were increases in serum alkaline phosphatase concomitant
with the increases in liver weight. Other toxic effects in the higher dosed animals included reduced food consumption
and body weight. EPA has derived an oral RfD of 0.07 mg/kg/day for this chemical based on the findings of this study.
Hepatotoxicity has also been reported in a 2year rat feeding study. The LOAEL was 60 mg/kg/day based on changes
in liver histopathology. The NOAEL was 20 mg/kg/day. Hepatotoxicity was also observed in a 90day rat feeding
study. The LOAEL was 150 mg/kg/day based on changes in liver histopathology, necrosis, and bile duct proliferation.
The NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day. Increased liver weights were also reported in mice following dietary exposure to picloram
for 13 weeks. The LOAEL was 1,000 mg/kg/day. Liver swelling was reported in rats administered picloram in feed for
13 weeks. The LOAEL was 150 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing picloram on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatotoxicity data for this chemical.
205. 

Piperonyl butoxide

 (CAS No. 000051-03-6) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for piperonyl butoxide include a
96hour LC

50

 of 3.4 ppb for rainbow trout and a 96hour LC

50

 of 4.2 ppb for bluegill. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing piperonyl butoxide on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical.
206. 

Pirimiphos methyl (O-(2-(diethylamino)-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl)-O,O-dimethyl phosphorothioate)

 (CAS No. 029232-93-7) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Pirimiphos methyl is a cholinesterase inhibitor in humans and other mammalian
species. A mild and transient decrease in plasma cholinesterase activity was observed in 2 of 4 female humans given
pirimiphos methyl daily in a capsule at dose levels of 0.25 mg/kg/day for 56 days. This effect was not seen in 3 of 3 males.
The dose level of 0.25 mg/kg/day was considered a NOEL for plasma cholinesterase inhibition. Based on the NOEL, an
oral RfD of 0.01 mg/kg/day was derived. The findings of the 56day study were corroborated by the 28day
feeding study (capsule) with 5 male human volunteers where 1 individual showed borderline cholinesterase depression.
Inhibition of brain cholinesterase (LOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day, the NOEL for cholinesterase inhibition was not determined)
was observed in a 2year feeding study in dogs. Inhibition of plasma cholinesterase activity (the LOEL was 2.5
mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day) was seen in a 2year feeding study in rats. No clinical signs were reported
for the above studies. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing pirimiphos methyl on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical.
207. 

Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs)

 (CAS No. NA) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Polycyclic aromatic compounds are a class of chemicals that include polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, azapolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, thio-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitroarenes, and
others. PACs can be formed in any combustion process that involves the burning of fuels or, more generally, materials
containing carbon and hydrogen. Some industrial sources include coke ovens, catalytic cracking of crude oil, carbon
black production, and iron and steel processes. 
Materials containing mixtures of PACs have been shown to be carcinogenic. Several epidemiology studies have shown
increased mortality due to lung cancer in humans exposed to coke-oven emissions, roofing-tar emissions, and cigarette
smoke. Each of these mixtures contains benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(a)phenanthrene,
and dibenzo(a,h)anthracene as well as other potentially carcinogenic PACs and other carcinogenic and potentially
carcinogenic chemicals, tumor promotors, initiators, and co-carcinogens such as nitrosoamines, coal tar pitch,
and creosote. Although it is impossible to evaluate the contribution of any individual PAC to the total carcinogenicity
of these mixtures to humans, reports of this nature provide qualitative evidence of the potential for mixtures containing
PACs to cause cancer in humans. In addition, several PACs caused cancer in animals when orally (e.g., benz(a)anthracene,
benzo(a)pyrene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene), dermally (e.g., benz(a)anthracene, benzo(a)phenanthrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene,
benzo(a)pyrene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, and indeno (1,2,3-cd)pyrene) or inhalationally (e.g., benzo(a)pyrene)
exposed. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing these PACs on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA

Benzo(a)phenanthrene (CAS No. 000218-01-9) 
Benzo(a)pyrene (CAS No. 000050-32-8) 
Benzo(rst)pentaphene (CAS No. 000189-55-9) 
Dibenzo(a,h)anthracene (CAS No. 000053-70-3) 
7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (CAS No. 000057-97-6)
Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (CAS No. 000193-39-5)
These PACs were proposed for listing individually in EPA's response to a petition to add certain chemicals that appear
on the RCRA list of toxic wastes under 40 CFR 261.33(f) to EPCRA section 313 (57 FR 41020, September 8, 1992). These chemicals
were proposed for addition based on the available carcinogenicity data. Due to the similarities of these seven PACs
to the chemicals listed in Unit IV.B.207.a. through IV.B.207.u. of this preamble, EPA believes that these chemicals
should be added to EPCRA section 313 as part of the delineated PAC category rather than listed individually. 
EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report is filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. In the case
of the delimited PAC category, only the 28 chemicals listed above would be included for purposes of making the threshold
determinations and in filing reports on releases. 
The Clean Air Act Amendments section 112(b) Hazardous Air Pollutants list includes a listing for polycyclic organic
matter (POM) that includes PACs. The definition given for the POM category is broad and chemically non-specific and
may be delineated by test method. For the purpose of listing under EPCRA section 313, EPA considered the following
more chemically-specific definition for a PAC category: ``includes all chemical species from the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon, aza-polycyclic, thio-polycyclic, or nitroarene families where polycyclic means three or more fused
rings. More specifically, it means any combination of three or more fused six or five membered hydrocarbon rings with
at least two or more rings being aromatic. The structure may contain fused non-aromatic five-membered rings, a ring
nitrogen, a ring sulfur, one or more attached nitro groups, or one or more attached alkyl groups.'' As an alternative
to the delimited category, EPA is proposing to add a PAC category based on this broad definition. Although this definition
may include chemicals of low or no concern, it may be less of a burden for facilities to report their total PACs rather
than trying to determine which and how much of the specific PACs covered by the delimited category they are producing
and releasing. EPA requests comment on the addition of the delimited PACs category versus the alternative PAC category
based on the broader definition. 208. 

Potassium bromate

 (CAS No. 007758-01-2) (IARC) (Ref. 8). IARC has assigned potassium bromate to Group 2B, i.e., it is possibly carcinogenic
to humans. Male and female rats orally exposed to 250 or 500 ppm (35 to 70 mg/kg/day) potassium bromate in drinking water
for 110 weeks had an increased incidence of renal cell adenomas and adenocarcinomas and, in males, there was also an
increased incidence of mesothelioma in the peritoneal cavity. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for
listing potassium bromate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity
data for this chemical. 
209. 

Potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate

 (CAS No. 000128-03-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). New Zealand White rabbits given 38 mg/kg/day by gavage on days 6 to 18 of gestation
exhibited malalignment of sternebrae, total postimplantation loss, and fetal weight decrement. Also at this dose
level, various malformations including adactyly, gastroschisis, short tail, anal atresia, spina bifida, atelectasis,
costal cartilage anomaly, vertebral anomaly with/without rib, caudal vertebrea anomaly, and severe sternebrae
malalignment were observed in 6 of 52 fetuses from 5 of 11 litters. At the 77 mg/kg/day dose level, there was severe fetal/embryo
lethality. The NOEL was 12.8 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for
this chemical. 
210.

 (CAS No. 000137-41-7) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). By analogy to the analogue, potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate, potassium
N-methyldithiocarbamate can reasonably be anticipated to cause fetotoxicity, postimplantation loss and malformations.
Data on potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate follows. New Zealand White rabbits given 38 mg/kg/day by gavage on days
6 to 18 of gestation exhibited malalignment of sternebrae, total postimplantation loss, and fetal weight decrement.
Also at this dose level various possible malformations including adactyly, gastroschisis, short tail, anal atresia,
spina bifida, atelectasis, costal cartilage anomaly, vertebral anomaly with/without rib, caudal vertebrea anomaly,
and severe sternebrae malalignment in 6 of 52 fetuses from 5 of 11 litters. At the 77 mg/kg/day dose level, there was
severe fetal/embryo lethality. The NOEL was 12.8 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing
potassium N-methyldithiocarbamate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
developmental toxicity data for potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate.

benzoate)

 (CAS No. 086209-51-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 90day dog feeding study, reduced thyroid weights accompanied
by colloid depletion and parafollicular hyperplasia and anemia were observed at the LOEL of 25 mg/kg/day. The NOEL
was 0.625 mg/kg/day. In a 1-year dog study, dietary administration of 250/125 mg/kg/day (LOEL: the dose was changed
after week 10 in the study) produced thyroid hyperplasia, anemia, increased platelet levels, vacuolar changes,
and increased absolute and relative liver weights. The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. In an 18month study in mice, dietary
administration of 1.7 mg/kg/day produced increased absolute and relative liver weights in females. No NOEL was established.
Based on this study, an oral RfD of 0.006 mg/kg/day was derived. In a 2year mouse study, increases in absolute
and relative liver weights were observed at 408 mg/kg/day in males and 1.7 mg/kg/day in females. The systemic LOEL
and NOEL in males was 408 mg/kg/day and 40.2 mg/kg/day, respectively. The systemic LOEL in females was 1.7 mg/kg/day
and a NOEL could not be established. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing primisulfuron on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available thyroid and liver toxicity data for this
chemical. 
Plant toxicity values include a duckweed 14day EC

50

 of 0.27 ppb and an algae 7day EC

50

 of 24 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing primisulfuron on EPCRA section 313 pursuant

cell cholinesterase activities were observed at 2 ppm (0.05 mg/kg/day). The NOEL was 0.2 ppm (0.005 mg/kg/day). Based
on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.00005 mg/kg/day. Other studies (21, 28, and 90day studies in rat, rabbit
and dog) also demonstrate cholinesterase (plasma, red blood cell or brain) inhibition in rats and mice. EPA believes
that there is sufficient evidence for listing profenofos on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on the available neurological toxicity data. 
213.

 (CAS No. 007287-19-6) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Degenerative changes in the liver and kidney, and bone marrow atrophy (the
LOEL was 37.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 3.75 mg/kg/day) were observed in dogs fed prometryn for 2 years. Based on the NOEL,
EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.004 mg/kg/day. Fatty liver degeneration (the LOEL was 500 mg/kg; the NOEL was 250 mg/kg)
was observed in rats fed prometryn for 28 days. 
In a teratology study in rabbits, test material was administered by gavage from gestation day 7 to 19. Increased abortions
and late resorptions occurred at 72 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 12 mg/kg/day. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing prometryn on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic, renal, bone marrow, and developmental toxicity data. 
214. 

Propachlor (2-chloro-N-(1-methylethyl)-N-phenylacetamide)

 (CAS No. 001918-16-7) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). No evidence of maternal toxicity was seen in rabbits administered propachlor
by gavage at 0, 5, 15, or 50 mg/kg/day on days 7 to 19 of gestation. Statistically significant increases in mean resorptions/postimplantation
loss with corresponding decreases in the mean number of viable fetuses were reported at 15 and 50 mg/kg/day when compared
to controls. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing propachlor on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data.

Propanil (N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)propanamide)

 (CAS No. 000709-98-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Results of several subchronic and chronic toxicity studies indicated
the liver and spleen as the target organs for propanil. Increased relative spleen weight (the LOEL was 20 mg/kg/day;
the NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day) was noted in female rats fed propanil for 2 years. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD
of 0.005 mg/kg/day. Histopathological changes (the LOEL was 30 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day) in the liver
and spleen were observed in mice orally administered propanil for 90 days. At higher dose levels (i.e., 240 and 1,920
mg/kg/day) cyanosis, methemoglobinemia, and increased liver and spleen weight were noted. In a 90day rat
study, increased spleen weight (the LOEL was 50 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 16.5 mg/kg/day) was seen in females. Decreased
hemoglobin levels was seen in males. Increased SGOT and SAP activities (the LOEL was 100 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 15
mg/kg/day) were observed in dogs orally administered propanil for 2 years. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing propanil on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
hepatic toxicity data. 
216. 

Propargite

 (CAS No. 002312-35-8) (CERCLA) (Ref. 8). In a developmental toxicity study in which rabbits were exposed via oral
gavage to doses greater than or equal to 6 mg/kg/day (fetotoxic LOAEL) of propargite during gestation days 6 to 18,
delayed ossification, increased fetal resorption, decreased fetal viability and reductions in fetal body weight
were noted. The maternal LOAEL in this study was also 6 mg/kg/day and was based on body weight reductions. The NOEL for
maternal and fetal toxicity was 2 mg/kg/day. Developmental effects (increased incidence of missing sternebrae)
were also reported in offspring of rats exposed orally during gestation days 6 to 15. The fetotoxicity LOAEL was 25
mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 6 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing propargite on
EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the developmental toxicity data for this chemical.

Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for propargite include a bluegill sunfish LC

50

 of 31 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing propargite on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
217. 

Propargyl alcohol

 (CAS No. 000107-19-7) (CERCLA; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Histopathological changes in the liver and kidney were
reported in a subchronic rat feeding study following exposure to propargyl alcohol in the diet for as little as 4 weeks.
The liver changes included increased organ weight, hepatocytic megalocytosis with proliferation of bile ducts
and cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes, as well as hematological and serum enzyme changes indicative of liver
damage. The kidney weights were increased in females only, and both sexes had karyomegaly of the renal tubular epithelial
cells. The LOAEL for these changes was 15 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day. EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.002 mg/kg/day
from this study. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing propargyl alcohol on EPCRA section 313
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity data for this chemical.

 (CAS No. 060207-90-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 2-generation rat reproduction study, dietary administration of 25
mg/kg/day produced an increased incidence of hepatic clear cell change in parental animals and administration of
125 mg/kg/day produced an increased incidence of hepatic lesions in offspring. The parental NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day
and the developmental NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. In a 2year mouse study, dietary administration of 65 mg/kg/day
(LOEL) produced increased liver lesions and liver weight in males, whereas, administration of 325 mg/kg/day produced
increased liver tumors, increased SGPT and SGOT levels, increased liver weight, hepatocyte enlargement, and vacuolation
and fat deposition in the liver of both sexes. The NOEL was 13 mg/kg/day. 
In a 3month dog dietary study, lymphoid follicles were observed in the mucous membranes of the pyloric part
of the stomach at 6.25 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 1.25 mg/kg/day. In a 1year dog study, dietary administration
of 6.25 mg/kg/day produced mild gastric mucosal irritation. The NOEL was 1.25 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL of the study,

increases in liver weights in female dogs. The NOEL was 10 mg/kg/day. In a 2year rat study, dietary administration
of 125 mg/kg/day produced increases in liver weight and pathological lesions. The NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day. 
In a one-generation reproduction rat study, administration of 25 mg/kg/day (LOEL) in the diet produced an increase
in dead pups and lower pup weight among survivors. No NOEL could be established. In a 3-generation reproduction rat
study, dietary administration of 25 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced an increase in pups cast dead and lower pup weight among
survivors. No NOEL could be established. Based on the NOEL of the study, an oral RfD of 0.03 mg/kg/day was derived.
Signs of neurotoxicity, including piloerection, ataxia, sensory changes in peripheral nerves, changes in locomotor
activity, salivation, tremors, and convulsions were observed in rats, dogs, mice, and rabbits given acute oral,
intravenous or intraperitoneal injections greater than or equal to 160 mg/kg. In a 3month rat inhalation study,
0.1 mg/L (LOEL) produced behavioral effects and 1 mg/L produced decreased locomotor activity, tremors, and other
behavioral changes. No NOEL could be established. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing resmethrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic, reproductive, and neurological toxicity data for this chemical. 
Aquatic acute toxicity values for resmethrin include a rainbow trout 96hour LC

50

 of 0.275 ppb (89 percent a.i.), a bluegill sunfish 96hour LC

50

 of 0.750 ppb (89 percent a.i.), a lake trout 96hour LC

50

 of 1.7 ppb (84.5 percent a.i.), and a fathead minnow 96hour LC

50

 of 3.0 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing resmethrin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
222. 

Sethoxydim (2-[1-(ethoxyimino)butyl]-5-[2(ethylthio)propyl]-3-hydroxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one)

 (CAS No. 074051-80-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Mild anemia (the LOEL was 17.5 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 8.9 mg/kg/day) was
observed in male dogs fed sethoxydim for 1year. Based on the NOEL, EPA derived an oral RfD of 0.09 mg/kg/day.
Swollen liver cells (the LOEL was 117 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 45 mg/kg/day) were seen in mice fed sethoxydim for 14 weeks.
Pathological effects in the liver (the LOEL was 45 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 15 mg/kg/day) were noted in rats fed sethoxydim
for 14 weeks. Nonneoplastic liver lesions (the LOEL was 54 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 18 mg/kg/day) were observed in mice
fed sethoxydim for 2 years. Decreased phenosulfophthalein (PSP) clearance (the NOEL was greater than 3 mg/kg/day;
the LOEL not determined) was noted in dogs given sethoxydim in the diet for 26 weeks. Decreased PSP clearance (the LOEL
was 20 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 2 mg/kg/day) was also noted in a 6month feeding study in dogs. EPA believes that
there is sufficient evidence for listing sethoxydim on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on the available hematological, hepatic, and renal toxicity data. 
223. 

Simazine

 (CAS No. 000122-34-9) (FIFRA SR; SDWA) (Ref. 8). Simazine is a triazine-type herbicide. Chronic exposure of sheep
to low doses (approximately 1.4 to 6 mg/kg/day) of simazine caused fatty and granular degeneration in the liver, and
increased SGOT and alkaline phosphatase. Neuronophagia, diffuse kidney degeneration, diffuse glial proliferation
and degeneration of ganglion cells in the cerebrum and medulla were also reported in these animals. Dogs that received
1,500 ppm (37.5 mg/kg/day) simazine in a 2year feeding study also had slight increases in serum alkaline phosphatase
and SGOT, indicative of liver damage. 
Sheep that received 1.4 mg/kg/day simazine for 37 to 111 days had necrotic changes in the germinal epithelium of the
testis and disturbances in spermatogenesis. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing simazine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the hepatic, renal, neurological, and reproductive toxicity of this chemical. 
224. 

Sodium azide

 (CAS No. 026628-22-8) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Although not used clinically, sodium azide is a direct
acting vasodilator. A reduction in blood pressure was noted in hypertensive patients orally exposed to sodium azide
during an investigation of the substance in treating cancer. Reductions in blood pressure were also reported in animals
following acute exposure. The minimal hypotensive dose in humans has been estimated to be approximately 0.2 to 0.4


m

g/kg (0.0002 to 0.0004 mg/kg). EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium azide on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the ability of this substance to lower blood pressure. 
225. 

Sodium chlorite

 (CAS No. 007758-19-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). A decrease in erythrocyte half-life (the LOEL was 100 ppm or 7.3 mg/kg/day;
the NOEL was 50 ppm or 3.65 mg/kg/day) was observed in cats administered sodium chlorite in the drinking water for 90
days. Increase in glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase activity, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), osmotic fragility,
and acanthocytes were observed in mice administered 100 ppm (19 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water for 30 days. In another
30day drinking water study, increased glucose-6-phosphatase dehydrogenase activity, MCV, and osmotic
fragility were noted in mice administered 100 ppm (19 mg/kg/day). The NOEL was 1.9 mg/kg/day. The results of in vitro
studies show that sodium chlorite can result in oxidative damage to erythrocytes. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing sodium chlorite on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available
hematological toxicity data. 
226. 

Sodium dicamba (3,6-Dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid, sodium salt)

 (CAS No. 001982-69-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). No toxicity data are available for sodium dicamba. However, data are available
on dicamba as discussed below. In solution, sodium dicamba will dissociate into sodium ion and the dicamba anion.
Decreased fetal body weights and increased postimplantation loss were observed in the offspring of rabbits receiving
10 mg/kg/day on days 6 through 18 of gestation. The LOEL was 10 mg/kg/day and NOEL was 3 mg/kg/day. Based on the NOEL,
EPA derived an oral RfD value of 0.03 mg/kg/day. In a separate study, disorders of oxidative phosphorylation and focal
necrosis in the heart were observed in newborn rats following transplacental exposure to dicamba. In a developmental
toxicity study, an increase in skeletal malformations was seen in the offspring of rats orally administered 64 mg/kg/day
on days 6 through 19 of gestation. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium dicamba on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for dicamba.

227. 

Sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate

 (CAS No. 000128-04-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). By analogy to potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate, sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate
can reasonably be anticipated to cause fetotoxicity, postimplantation loss and malformations. Data on potassium
dimethyldithiocarbamate follows. New Zealand white rabbits given 38 mg/kg/day by gavage on days 6 to 18 of gestation
exhibited malalignment of sternebrae, total postimplantation loss, and fetal weight decrement. Also at this dose
level, various possible malformations including adactyly, gastroschisis, short tail, anal atresia, spina bifida,
atelectasis, costal cartilage anomaly, vertebral anomaly with/without rib, caudal vertebrea anomaly, and severe
sternebrae malalignment in 6 of 52 fetuses from 5 of 11 litters. At the 77 mg/kg/day dose level, there was severe fetal/embryo
lethality. The NOEL was 12.8 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for
the analogue potassium dimethyldithiocarbamate. 
228. 

Sodium fluoroacetate

 (CAS. No. 000062-74-8) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). In a 13week oral study in rats,
gavage administration of sodium fluoroacetate (0.02 mg/kg/day) resulted in decreased testis weight and altered
spermatogenesis in males (the NOAEL was 0.05 mg/kg/day). In addition, increased heart weight was noted in females
and males administered 0.20 mg/kg/day of sodium fluoroacetate. The increase in heart weight, however, was only accompanied
by subacute, minimal inflammation (not dose-related). Also, fluorocitrate levels were significantly increased
after 4 weeks in males administered 0.50 mg/kg/day and after 13 weeks in both male and female rats administered 0.20
or 0.50 mg/kg/day. The testicular and cardiac effects were reported to be consistent with those noted in the literature.

A case study reported a deliberate ingestion of an unspecified dose of sodium fluroacetate by a healthy female. The
woman experienced nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain 30 minutes after ingestion, with subsequent seizures occurring
60 minutes after the initial onset of symptoms. Neurological examination after 2 weeks revealed severe cerebellar
dysfunction. By 18 months, memory disturbances and depressive behavior persisted. Inhalation exposure to unspecified
levels of sodium fluoroacetate caused salivation, loss of speech, violent convulsions, and coma in a male worker.
The patient ultimately recovered. Neurological effects have also been reported in rats in a 13week oral study.
Four of 20 female rats treated with 0.50 mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested) exhibited convulsions at day 79, with
no recurrences for the remainder of the study. An estimated lethal dose of sodium fluoroacetate in humans ranges from
5 to 10 mg/kg. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium fluoroacetate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the neurologic, reproductive, and myocardial toxicity data for this chemical.
Measured oral LD

50

 values of fluoroacetate in the house sparrow, redwinged blackbird, starling and golden eagle are 3.0, 4.22, 2.37,
and 1.25 to 5 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, measured acute toxicity data for mammalian wildlife include an oral
LD

50

 of 0.22 to 0.44 mg/kg for mule deer, an oral LD

50

 of 1.41 mg/kg for male ferrets, and an oral LD

50

 of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg for bears. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium fluoroacetate on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
229. 

Sodium hypochlorite

 (CAS No. 007681-52-9) (CERCLA) (Ref. 8). Aquatic acute toxicity data for sodium hypochlorite include a 96hour
measured LC

50

 of 100 ppb for bluegill and a 96hour measured LC

50

 of 80 ppb for fathead minnow. In addition, the 96hour measured LC

50

 values for non-standard test species range from 32 ppb for coho salmon to 82 ppb for Pacific sand lance. EPA believes
that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium hypochlorite on EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available
ecotoxicity data for this chemical. 
230. 

Sodium nitrite

 (CAS No. 007632-00-0) (CERCLA) (Ref. 8). Sodium nitrite causes conversion (oxidation) of hemoglobin to methemoglobin.
Methemoglobin cannot combine reversibly with oxygen and its formation can cause anemic hypoxia which may lead to
intense cyanosis. Infants are particularly susceptible to this effect because of their higher stomach pH, immature
enzyme systems, the reduced capacity of newborn erythrocytes to reduce methemoglobin to hemoglobin, and the increased
rate of nitrite-induced oxidation of fetal hemoglobin to methemoglobin (approximately twice the rate of adult hemoglobin
oxidation). Coma and methemoglobinemia/ carboxyhemoglobinemia were reported in a human that received sodium nitrite
(71 mg/kg) orally. In animal studies, methemoglobinemia was reported in dogs that received an intravenous dose of
30 mg/kg sodium nitrite and in rats administered a 10 mg/kg dose of sodium nitrite subcutaneously. 
Fetotoxicity (fetal death) was reported following oral exposure of pregnant rats to sodium nitrite (30 mg/kg/day)
during gestation days 1 through 22. In mice exposed orally to 80 mg/kg/day during gestation days 6 to 15 there was increased
preimplantation loss and fetal death, and in mice exposed to a lower dose (20 mg/kg/day) during gestation days 1 to
14, abnormalities of the blood or lymphatic system were reported in offspring. In offspring of rats orally exposed
to 26 to 256 mg/kg/day during pregnancy (gestation days 1 through 22) and/or during lactation (20 to 21 days after birth),
effects on growth including biochemical and/or metabolic changes were noted. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium nitrite on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic hematological and developmental toxicity data for this chemical.
231. 

Sodium pentachlorophenate

 (CAS No. 000131-52-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Pentachlorophenol has been classified by EPA as a Group B2 compound, i.e.,
a probable human carcinogen. This was based on occurrence of increased combined incidence of hemangiosarcomas,
liver tumors, and pheochromocytomas in female mice. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium
pentachlorophenate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available carcinogenicity
data for its parent compound, pentachlorophenol.
Aquatic acute toxicity values for sodium pentachlorophenate include a rainbow trout 96hour LC

50

 of 55 ppb, a bluegill 96hour LC

50

 of 44 ppb, a fathead minnow 96hour LC

50

 of 20 ppb, and a shrimp 96hour LC

50

 of 84 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium pentachlorophenate on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.

232. 

Sodium o-phenylphenoxide

 (CAS No. 000132-27-4) (CERCLA; IARC) (Ref. 8). Sodium o-phenylphenoxide has been classified by IARC as a Group 2B
compound; i.e., the substance is possibly carcinogenic in humans. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing sodium o-phenylphenoxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity
data for this chemical. 
233. 

Sodium 2-pyridinethiol-1-oxide

 (CAS No. 015922-78-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). New Zealand white rabbits were tested with test material dermally on days
6 to 18 of gestation. At 0.5 mg/kg/day, pups exhibited missing or defective vertebrae, ribs and sternebrae. No NOEL
was established. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sodium 2-pyridinethiol-1-oxide on
EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data for
this chemical. 
234. 

Strychnine and salts

 (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; FIFRA SR; RCRA APP8; RCRA P) (Ref. 8). Strychnine salts will dissociate in aqueous solutions to
yield soluble strychnine. Strychnine, an alkaloid, can cause violent convulsions in humans. Other effects include
agitation, hypertonicity of muscles, and painful muscle spasms. Renal failure and respiratory paralysis generally
ensues, from severe or prolonged convulsions. A potentially lethal oral dose in a small child is 5 to 10 mg. The lethal
oral dose for an adult may be as low as 30 mg. Similar effects have also been reported in animals exposed at lethal doses
ranging from 0.25 to 2.35 mg/kg via oral and parenteral routes of exposure. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that
strychnine and strychnine salts concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result
of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant
adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing strychnine and salts
as a category on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and
exposure data for this chemical. 
EPCRA section 313 requires threshold determinations for chemical categories to be based on the total of all chemicals
in the category manufactured, processed, or otherwise used. For example, a facility that manufactures three members
of a chemical category would count the total amount of all three chemicals manufactured towards the manufacturing
threshold for that category. When filing reports for chemical categories, the releases are determined in the same
manner as the thresholds. One report if filed for the category and all releases are reported on this form. 
235. 

Sulfur dioxide

 (CAS No. 007446-09-5) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Acid precipitation occurs in large regions of the Eastern United
States and Canada, Europe, and Japan. This widespread occurrence of acid precipitation and dry deposition results
in large part from man-made emissions of oxides of sulfur (e.g., sulfur dioxide) and oxides of nitrogen. These substances
are transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric acid and nitric acid, transported over great distances and deposited
on vegetation, soils, surface waters, and materials. These substances are transferred from the atmosphere into
ecosystems by the absorption of gases, the impaction and gravitational settling of fine aerosols and coarse particles
and, precipitation. 
Acids contained in polluted snow are released as contaminated meltwater. The resulting release of pollutants can
cause major or rapid changes in the acidity of streams and lake waters. Interference with normal reproduction in fish
populations is induced by acidity of lake and stream waters. Reproduction of frogs and salamanders is also inhibited
by atmospheric acidification of surface waters. 
Atmospheric deposition of sulfuric acid and nitric acid can cause serious damage to crops and forests. Biological
effects include induction of necrotic lesions, loss of nutrients due to leaching from foliar organs, accelerated
erosion of waxes and leaf surfaces, and interference with normal reproductive processes. Acidification decreases
the rate of many soil processes such as nitrogen fixation and the breakdown of organic matter. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sulfur dioxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
Limited data on long-term human exposure to sulfuric acid with respect to occupational settings are available. Recent
studies suggest that sulfuric acid aerosols at levels as low as 0.02 to 0.04 mg/m

3

 may cause significant effects on lung function in humans. Effects noted include increased risk of chronic bronchitis
in smokers and reduced tracheobronchial clearance rate. Other studies suggest that sulfuric acid at concentrations
as low as 0.04 mg/m

3

 may act synergistically with copollutants such as ozone, NO

2

, and metal particulates in causing decreased pulmonary diffusing capacity and bronchial hypersensitivity. These
effects are presumably attributable to the acidic and oxidative properties of sulfuric acid, and are therefore pH
and concentration dependent. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sulfur dioxide on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for sulfuric acid,
the hydrolysis product of sulfur dioxide.

Sulfur dioxide is regulated under Title I of the CAA (Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance of National Ambient
Air Quality Standards) and Title IV of the CAA (Acid Deposition Control). In addition to this proposal to add sulfur
dioxide to EPCRA section 313, in Units IV.B.36. and 179, EPA is proposing to add two other chemicals, carbon monoxide
and nitrogen dioxide, that are regulated under Title I of the CAA. Extensive data, which are highly technical, are
collected on these chemicals as required by the CAA. EPA requests comment on the following: (1) Is the information
collected under the CAA sufficient for public right-to-know purposes; and (2) suggestions on how the data collected
on these chemicals pursuant to CAA Titles I and IV could be used to meet the purposes of EPCRA section 313.

Sulfur trioxide

 (CAS No. 007446-11-9) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). IARC has classified sulfur trioxide in Group 1, i.e., the chemical is carcinogenic
to humans based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence
for listing sulfur trioxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data
for this chemical.
Acid precipitation occurs in large regions of the Eastern United States and Canada, Europe, and Japan. This widespread
occurrence of acid precipitation and dry deposition results in large part from man-made emissions of oxides of sulfur
(e.g., sulfur trioxide) and oxides of nitrogen. These substances are transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric
acid and nitric acid, transported over great distances and deposited on vegetation, soils, surface water, and materials.
These substances are transferred from the atmosphere into ecosystems by the absorption of gases, the impaction and
gravitational settling of fine aerosols and coarse particles and, precipitation. 
Acids contained in polluted snow are released as contaminated meltwater. The resulting release of pollutants can
cause major or rapid changes in the acidity of streams and lake waters. Interference with normal reproduction in fish
populations is induced by acidity of lake and stream waters. Reproduction of frogs and salamanders is also inhibited
by atmospheric acidification of surface waters.
Atmospheric deposition of sulfuric acid and nitric acid can cause serious damage to crops and forests. Biological
effects include induction of necrotic lesions, loss of nutrients due to leaching from foliar organs, accelerated
erosion of waxes and leaf surfaces, and interference with normal reproductive processes. Acidification decreases
the rate of many soil processes such as nitrogen fixation and the breakdown of organic matter.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sulfur trioxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data for this chemical.
Limited data on long-term human exposure to sulfuric acid with respect to occupational settings are available. Recent
studies suggest that sulfuric acid aerosols at levels as low as 0.02 to 0.04 mg/m

3

 may cause significant effects on lung function in humans. Effects noted include increased risk of chronic bronchitis
in smokers and reduced tracheobronchial clearance rate. Other studies suggest that sulfuric acid at concentrations
as low as 0.04 mg/m

3

 may act synergistically with copollutants such as ozone, NO

2

, and metal particulates in causing decreased pulmonary diffusing capacity and bronchial hypersensitivity. These
effects are presumably attributable to the acidic and oxidative properties of sulfuric acid, and are therefore pH
and concentration dependent. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sulfur trioxide on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic toxicity data for sulfuric acid,
the hydrolysis product of sulfur trioxide.

237. 

Sulfuryl fluoride (Vikane)

 (CAS No. 002699-79-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). The primary effects of sulfuryl fluoride in humans are respiratory irritation
and central nervous system depression, followed by excitation and possibly convulsions. Rabbits exposed via inhalation
(6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 2 weeks) to sulfuryl fluoride showed hyperactivity, convulsions and vacuolation
of the cerebrum at 600 ppm (2.5 mg/L). Renal lesions were present in all rats exposed by inhalation (6 hours/day, 5 days/week,
for 2 weeks) to 600 ppm (2.5 mg/L) sulfuryl fluoride. Minimal renal changes were noted in rats exposed to 300 ppm (1252
mg/L), whereas no effects occurred at 100 ppm (4.2 mg/L). Convulsions at near lethal concentrations were reported
in rabbits, mice, and rats. In a 30-day inhalation study, loss of control, tremors of the hind quarters, and histopathological
changes in the lung, liver, and kidney were reported in rabbits exposed to 400 ppm (1.6 mg/L) for 7 hours/day, 5 days/week
for 5 weeks. The NOEL was 200 ppm (0.83 mg/L). Cerebral vacuolation and/or malacia and inflammation of nasal tissues
were observed in rabbits exposed by inhalation to 100 or 300 ppm (0.4 or 1.25 mg/L) for 13 weeks. The NOEL was 30 ppm (0.125
mg/L). Rats exposed by inhalation to 100 to 600 ppm (0.4 to 0.25 mg/L) sulfuryl fluoride for 13 weeks developed mottled
teeth (indicative of fluoride toxicity), renal and respiratory effects, and cerebral vacuolation. EPA believes
that there is sufficient evidence for listing sulfuryl fluoride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B)
based on the available neurological, renal, and respiratory toxicity data for this chemical.

administration of 15 mg/kg/day for 3 months produced hyperactivity in female rats. The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. In the
same study, 5 mg/kg/day produced red blood cell and brain cholinesterase inhibition in both sexes. The cholinesterase
NOEL was 1.5 mg/kg/day. Red blood cell and brain cholinesterase inhibition, diarrhea, vomiting, and some hind limb
paralysis were seen in dogs orally administered 5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) for 3 months. The NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day. In a 22month
dietary mouse study, plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase were inhibited at 3.25 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.325
mg/kg/day. Plasma, red blood cell, and brain cholinesterase inhibition were seen at a dietary administration of
2.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL) in a 2year dog study. The NOEL was 0.25 mg/kg/day. Based on this study, an oral RfD of 0.003
mg/kg/day was derived. Dietary administration of 3 mg/kg/day (LOEL) produced plasma and red blood cell cholinesterase
depression in a 2year rat study. The NOEL was 0.3 mg/kg/day. Increased unossified sternebrae were observed
in the offspring of rats given 10 mg/kg/day (LOEL) by gavage during days 6 to 15 of gestation. No NOEL was established.

EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing sulprofos on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological and developmental toxicity data for this chemical.
The aquatic acute values for sulprofos include bluegill 96hour LC

243. 

Tetracycline hydrochloride

 (CAS No. 000064-75-5) (CAL) (Ref. 8). Tetracycline hydrochloride is widely used as an antibiotic for the treatment
of many common infections. The average oral adult dose for most infections is 1 to 2 grams per day in equally divided
doses. The most frequent adverse reactions to orally administered tetracycline hydrochloride are gastrointestinal
effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bulky loose stools, and abdominal discomfort. Photosensitivity,
manifested as an exaggerated sunburn reaction on sun-exposed areas of the body has occurred following oral therapy
with tetracycline hydrochloride. Photosensitivity reactions of this type generally develop within a few minutes
to several hours after sun exposure and usually persist 1 to 2 days after discontinuance of tetracycline hydrochloride.

Manufacturers of tetracycline hydrochloride state that this substance should not be used in women during the last
half of pregnancy or in children younger than 8 years of age unless other appropriate drugs are ineffective or contraindicated.
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that tetracycline hydrochloride be used only in children who are 9
years of age or older, except under unusual circumstances. Use of tetracycline hydrochloride in pregnant women or
infants has resulted in retardation of skeletal development and bone growth in the fetus or child. Because tetracycline
hydrochloride localizes in the dentin and enamel of developing teeth, use of this substance during tooth development
may cause enamel hypoplasia and permanent yellow-gray to brown discoloration of the teeth. Use of tetracycline hydrochloride
may result in discoloration of the deciduous teeth of children if the substance is used during pregnancy or in children
up to 4 to 6 months of age. These effects are most common following long-term use of tetracycline hydrochloride but
have occured following repeated short-term use. Premature infants treated with tetracycline have demonstrated
a 40 percent depression of bone growth. This effect is readily reversible if exposure to the substance is short. 
Intraperitoneal injection of 85 mg/kg/day on days 14 to 18 of gestation has resulted in abortion and extra embryonic
structures in rat offspring. Subcutaneous injection of 48 mg/kg/day on days 16 through 20 of gestation and intramuscular
injection of 40 mg/kg/day to rats on days 10 through 15 of gestation resulted in embryo/fetotoxicity. Exposure to
50 mg/kg/day on days 7 to 15 of pregnancy resulted in postimplantation loss and fetotoxicity in rats. Exposure to 85
mg/kg/day on days 7 to 15 of pregnancy resulted in abortion in rats. Fetotoxicity was observed in mice receiving 86
mg/kg/day of tetracycline hydrochloride on days 8 to 13 of gestation. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing tetracycline hydrochloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available developmental toxicity data and other chronic toxicity data
for this chemical.

weight. The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day. Increased erythrocyte count, thrombocyte count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit
levels in females and increased serum alkaline phosphatase, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic
transaminase, liver weights, and hyperplastic nodules in both sexes were observed at 234 mg/kg/day in a 2year
mouse dietary study. The NOEL was 6.5 mg/kg/day and the LOEL was 39 mg/kg/day. In another 2year mouse dietary
study, administration of 234 mg/kg/day produced hepatocellular adenomas. Doses of 39 mg/kg/day in males (LOEL)
and 6.5 mg/kg/day in females (LOEL) produced nonneoplastic and preneoplastic changes in the liver, increased liver
weights with correlating effects on serum enzymes, and hepatocellular hypertrophy. The NOEL in males was 6.5 mg/kg/day
and no NOEL in females could be established. 
Cleft palates were observed in the offspring of rats orally administered 75 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day.
Increased incidence of abnormal ribs, extra ribs, and distended urinary bladders were observed in the offspring
of rats orally administered 90 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day. Increases in fetal resorptions were observed
in rabbits given 100 mg/kg/day by gavage (LOEL). The NOEL was 30 mg/kg/day. Increased incidences of incomplete ossification
of pelvic pubes and phalanges, and irregular spinous processes were observed in the offspring of rabbits orally administered
50 mg/kg/day (LOEL) on days 6 through 18 of gestation. The NOEL was 20 mg/kg/day. 
In a 3-generation rat reproduction study, decreased fertility and decreased litter size were observed at 90 mg/kg/day
(LOEL). The NOEL was 15 mg/kg/day. In a 2-generation reproduction study in rats, decreased pup weights, decreased
litter size, and decreased pup viability were observed at 90 mg/kg/day (LOEL). The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triadimefon on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic, hematological, developmental, and reproductive toxicity data for
this chemical. 
254. 

Triallate

 (CAS No. 002303-17-5) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Triallate, a dithiocarbamate insecticide, is a cholinesterase inhibitor.
When triallate was administered to rats at a dose of 147.1 mg/kg/day orally and to cats at a dose of 0.028 mg/L/day (via
aerosol) for 2 months, the animals developed fatal morphological changes in neurons of the cerebral cortex, subcortical
area, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Doses of 30 mg/kg/day caused head bobbing and circling in pregnant rats. The NOEL
was 7.5 mg/kg/day. The LOEL and NOEL for liver effects in a 2year study in dogs fed diets containing triallate
were 4.25 mg/kg/day and 1.28 mg/kg/day, respectively. At 4.25 mg/kg/day an increase in hemosiderin deposition and
serum alkaline phosphatase was observed in both sexes, and an increase in liver weight was observed in females. Based
on the NOEL, an oral RfD of 0.013 mg/kg/day was derived. In a hamster chronic feeding study, decreased triglycerides
were seen in males at the LOEL of 30 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. Ninety-day feeding studies in rats (10 mg/kg/day)
and dogs (5 mg/kg/day) showed no treatment related adverse effects except for increased liver-to-body-weight ratios
in the dogs. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triallate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to
EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurological and hepatic toxicity data for this chemical. 
255. 

Tribenuron methyl (2-(((((4-methoxy-6-methyl-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-methylamino)carbonyl)amino)sulfonyl)-,
methyl ester)

 (CAS No. 101200-48-0) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 1-year feeding study in dogs, elevated serum bilirubin and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) levels and increased urinary volume were reported in males receiving 8.16 mg/kg/day (LOEL).
The NOEL for males was 0.79 mg/kg/day. The LOEL for females was 52.02 mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested) and was based
on increased serum creatinine and transient increases in AST, globulin, and serum bilirubin. These females had an
18.2 percent decrease in body weight gain. The NOEL for females was 8.18 mg/kg/day. The highest dose in males (51.46
mg/kg/day) caused increases in serum creatinine and a 20 percent decrease in body weight gain. The oral RfD, derived
from the NOEL for males, was 0.008 mg/kg/day. In a 90day feeding study, decreased absolute and relative liver
and kidney weights, serum glucose, globulin and cholesterol levels were observed in rats at 87.5 mg/kg/day (LOEL).
The NOEL was 5 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing tribenuron methyl on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hepatic and renal toxicity data for this chemical.

256. 

Tributyltin fluoride

 (CAS No. 001983-10-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Aquatic acute toxicity values for tributyltin fluoride include a bleak
fish 96hour LC

50

 of 2.3 ppb, an algae 72hour EC

50

 of 9.3 ppb, and a Harpacticoid copepod 96hour LC

50

 of 0.8 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing tributyltin fluoride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the available environmental toxicity data. 
257. 

Tributyltin methacrylate

 (CAS No. 002155-70-6) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Pregnant rats were given tributyltin methacrylate by gavage on days 6 to
19 of gestation. Mean fetal weight and maternal body weight gain were decreased at 18 mg/kg/day. Fetal resorptions
were also significantly increased. The fetotoxic NOEL for this study was 9 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing tributyltin methacrylate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based
on the available developmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
258. 

S,S,S-Tributyltrithiophosphate (DEF)

 (CAS No. 000078-48-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 8). S,S,S-Tributyltrithiophosphate (DEF) is a cholinesterase inhibitor.
Both immediate and delayed neurotoxic effects have been reported in humans following exposure to DEF. The exposure
levels at which these effects occurred, however, were not reported. In a 3month hen feeding study, the NOEL
for neurotoxic effects was 0.1 mg/kg/day and the LOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day. At 0.5 mg/kg day, hens showed delayed neurotoxicity,
ataxia, and equivocal changes in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Based on the NOEL, EPA has derived an oral RfD
of 0.00003 mg/kg/day for this chemical. In a 12week dog feeding study, animals showed over sensitivity to stimuli
at 0.62 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was 0.12 mg/kg/day. In the same study, the LOEL for cholinesterase inhibition was 0.12
mg/kg/day and a NOEL was not established. Brain cholinesterase inhibition was observed in a chronic rat feeding study
at 1.25 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 0.25 mg/kg/day. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing S,S,S-tributyltrithiophosphate
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the chronic neurotoxicity data for this chemical.

Measured acute aquatic toxicity data for S,S,Stributyltrithiophosphate include a rainbow trout 96hour
LC

50

 of 660 ppb (0.660 ppm) and a bluegill 96hour LC

50

 of 620 ppb (0.620 ppm). The measured log K

ow

 is 5.7. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing S,S,S-tributyltrithiophosphate on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical and its potential
for bioaccumulation. 
259. 

Trichloroacetyl chloride

 (CAS No. 000076-02-8) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Trichloroacetyl chloride is highly toxic in humans by the oral and inhalation
routes of exposure. Numerous cases of strong irritation of the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract and fever, nausea,
and vomiting following exposure to trichloroacetyl chloride have been reported. The acute inhalation LC

50

 values for mice and rats are 0.445 mg/L and 0.475 mg/L, respectively, indicating that trichloroacetyl chloride is
highly toxic by inhalation in these species. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that trichloroacetyl chloride concentrations
are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases,
at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes
that there is sufficient evidence for listing trichloroacetyl chloride on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
260. 

Trichloroethylsilane

 (CAS No. 000115-21-9) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Chlorinated silanes are very corrosive to the skin and mucous membranes
and liberate hydrochloric acid in the presence of water. Trichloroethylsilane causes severe burns and the vapor
is harmful to humans. The mouse 2hour inhalation LC

50

 value is 0.30 mg/L. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that trichloroethylsilane concentrations are likely to exist
beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can
reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient
evidence for listing trichloroethylsilane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on
the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
261. 

Trichlorophenylsilane

 (CAS No. 000098-13-5) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Chlorinated silanes are very corrosive to the skin and mucous membranes
and liberate hydrochloric acid in the presence of water. Trichlorophenylsilane causes severe burns and the vapor
is harmful to humans (concentration not specified). The 2hour mouse inhalation LC

50

 value is 0.33 mg/L. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that trichlorophenylsilane concentrations are likely to
exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that
can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is
sufficient evidence for listing trichlorophenylsilane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A)
based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
262. 

1,2,3-Trichloropropane

 (CAS No. 000096-18-4) (RCRA APP8) (Ref. 8). Results of a subchronic oral toxicity study in rats and mice reveal that
the primary target organs for 1,2,3-trichloropropane are the liver and kidney. Renal and hepatic necrosis were observed
in rats administered 1,2,3-trichloropropane by gavage for 17 weeks. The LOAEL was 16 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 8
mg/kg/day for hepatic effects. The LOAEL was 32 mg/kg/day and the NOAEL was 16 mg/kg/day for renal effects. Hepatic
necrosis in mice occurred at 125 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was 63 mg/kg/day. Less severe renal necrotic changes were seen
at 250 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL was 125 mg/kg/day. The renal and hepatic lesions were accompanied by increases in organ
weights and alterations in serum enzymes that were indicative of hepatic and renal toxicity. At lower dose levels
(the LOAEL was 16 mg/kg/day), nonregenerative anemia (decreased hematocrit, hemoglobin, and erythrocyte count)
was observed in rats. The NOAEL was 8 mg/kg/day. Nonregenerative anemia is considered to be one of the most sensitive
effects of 1,2,3-trichloropropane. 
The respiratory tract is a principal target of inhaled 1,2,3-trichloropropane in humans and animals. Irritation
of the eyes and throat has been reported in humans acutely exposed (15 minutes) to 100 ppm (0.602 mg/L) of 1,2,3-trichloropropane
via inhalation. Irritative effects on the olfactory epithelium have been observed in rats exposed by inhalation
to 3 ppm (the LOAEL was 0.018 mg/L; the NOAEL was 0.006 mg/L) of 1,2,3-trichloropropane for 11 days. Histological effects
have also been seen in the nasal cavity (the LOEL was 125 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 63 mg/kg/day) in rats and in the bronchiolar
epithelium (the LOEL was 63 mg/kg/day; the NOAEL was 32 mg/kg/day) in mice that were exposed to 1,2,3-trichloropropane
by oral intubation for 17 weeks. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing 1,2,3-trichloropropane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the hematological, respiratory, hepatic, and renal toxicity data for this
chemical. 
263. 

Triclopyr triethylammonium salt

 (CAS No. 057213-69-1) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Degeneration of proximal tubules (the LOEL was 20 mg/kg/day; the NOEL was
5 mg/kg/day) was noted in male and female rats fed triclopyr for 3 months. A LOEL of 2.5 mg/kg/day, based on phenosulfophthalein
(PSP) excretion, was reported in dogs fed triclopyr for 6 months. A similar effect was also noted at the LOEL of 5 mg/kg/day,
determined in dogs fed triclopyr for 8 months. The NOEL was greater than 5 mg/kg/day. Significant increases in absolute
and relative kidney weights were observed in rats fed 36 mg/kg/day for 2 years. The NOEL was 12 mg/kg/day. In a pharmacokinetic
study, reduced PSP excretion was seen in dogs administered 5 mg/kg/day, whereas no effect on PSP excretion was seen
in monkeys administered 20 mg/kg/day. No details on the route and length of exposure were provided. EPA believes that
there is sufficient evidence for listing triclopyr triethylammonium salt on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available renal toxicity data. 
264. 

Triethylamine

 (CAS No. 000121-44-8) (CAA HAP) (Ref. 7). Triethylamine is an acute irritant which causes eye and nasal irritation
and pulmonary toxicity in mice and rats and is an acute eye toxicant in man. 
In a survey of workers exposed to triethylamine, none of the workers reported effects at 5 ppm. Slight to mild effects
were noted at concentrations between 5 and 10 ppm and above 10 ppm workers reported visual disturbances which included
halo vision and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat. In a separate report, eye irritation and visual disturbances
consisting of foggy vision, blue haze or halo vision (halo around lights) was reported in 19 workers exposed to triethylamine.
Exact exposure levels were not determined. The TWA in the work place of those individuals who complained of ``blue
haze'' was 11 mg/m

3

 with a range of 4 to 24 mg/m

3

. The American Council of Government and Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) has set a threshold limit value-time weighted
average (TLV-TWA) of 10 ppm and a threshold limit value-short-term exposure limit (TLV-STEL) of 15 ppm based upon
inhalation toxicity in guinea pigs and rats and skin irritation and eye injury in rabbits. 
EPA's exposure analysis indicates that triethylamine concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries,
as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause
significant adverse acute human health effects. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triethylamine
on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data
for this chemical. 
265. 

Triforine (N,N'-[1,4-piperazinediylbis(2,2,2-trichloroethylidene)] bisformamide)

 (CAS No. 026644-46-2) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). In a 2year feeding study in rats, anemia was reported. The LOEL, based
on this effect, was 3,125 ppm (156 mg/kg/day) and the NOEL was 625 ppm (31.25 mg/kg/day). Siderosis of Kupffer cells
and bone marrow cells was reported in dogs exposed to triforine in their diet for 2 years. The LOEL in this study was 1,000
ppm (25 mg/kg/day) and the NOEL was 100 ppm (2.5 mg/kg/day). Effects on red blood cells, hematocrit or hemoglobin were
also noted in dogs or rats in several 13week feeding studies. For example, dogs exposed to a 20.6 percent a.i.
formulation of the compound for 13 weeks at dose levels that included 600 ppm (the LOEL, equivalent to 15 mg/kg/day
or 3.1 mg a.i./kg/day) and 100 ppm (the NOEL, equivalent to 2.5 mg/kg/day or 0.5 mg a.i./kg/day) had siderosis in the
liver, spleen, and bone marrow. 
A decrease in mean relative weight of offspring was observed in rabbits exposed to 25 mg/kg triforine (the fetotoxicity
LOEL). The fetotoxicity NOEL was 5 mg/kg. The LOEL and NOEL for maternal toxicity in this developmental toxicity study
were also 25 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, and were based on reduced food intake and body weight loss. Fetotoxicity
(decreased number of fetuses and increased resorptions) was also reported in the offspring of rats fed 1,600 mg/kg
(the fetotoxicity LOEL) for an unspecified duration. The fetotoxicity NOEL was 800 mg/kg. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triforine on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available hematological and developmental toxicity data for this chemical. 266. 

Trimethylchlorosilane

 (CAS No. 000075-77-4) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Chlorinated silanes are very corrosive to the skin and mucous membranes
and liberate hydrochloric acid in the presence of water. Trimethylchlorosilane causes severe burns and the vapor
is harmful to humans. The mouse inhalation LCLo value is 0.10 mg/L. EPA's exposure analysis indicates that trimethylchlorosilane
concentrations are likely to exist beyond facility site boundaries, as a result of continuous, or frequently recurring
releases, at levels that can reasonably be anticipated to cause significant adverse acute human health effects.
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing trimethylchlorosilane on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(A) based on the available acute toxicity and exposure data for this chemical. 
267. 

2,3,5-Trimethylphenyl methylcarbamate

 (CAS No. 002655-15-4) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). Cholinesterase inhibition was reported in a series of studies for this
carbamate pesticide. In dogs that received 2,000 ppm (50 mg/kg/day) 2,3,5-trimethylphenyl methylcarbamate in
their diet for 14 days, there was inhibition of plasma and red blood cell cholinesterases and also weight loss. Brain
cholinesterase was slightly decreased in rats in a 2year feeding study at 200 ppm (10 mg/kg/day). At 800 ppm
(40 mg/kg/day), there were fatty changes in the liver which disappeared after 7.5 months. EPA believes that there
is sufficient evidence for listing 2,3,5-trimethylphenyl methylcarbamate on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA
section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available neurological toxicity data for this chemical. 
268. 

Triphenyltin chloride

 (CAS No. 000639-58-7) (EPCRA EHS) (Ref. 8). Oral exposure of male rats to 380 mg/kg triphenyltin chloride over 19 days
caused adverse effects on the testes, epididymis, sperm duct, prostate gland, seminal vesicle, Cowper's gland,
and accessory glands. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triphenyltin chloride on EPCRA
section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the reproductive toxicity data for this chemical. 
Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for triphenyltin chloride include a 48hour LC

50

 for carp of 55 ppb and a 72hour EC

50

 (growth) for marine green algae of 0.92 ppb. In addition, the measured aquatic toxicity information indicates a freshwater
green algae 8day EC

50

 (growth) of 2 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triphenyltin chloride on EPCRA section
313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
269. 

Triphenyltin hydroxide

 (CAS No. 000076-87-9) (FIFRA SR) (Ref. 8). Triphenyltin hydroxide has been classified by EPA as a Group B2 compound,
i.e., a probable carcinogen. This was based on the significant increases in fetal pituitary gland adenomas in female
Wistar rats and Leydig cell tumors in male Wistar rats fed 1 or 4 mg/kg/day triphenyltin hydroxide for 2 years. There
were significant increases of hepatocellular adenomas and combined hepatocellular (adenoma and/or carcinoma)
tumars in male and female NMRI mice fed 0.65, 2.6, or 10.4 mg/kg/day for 80 weeks. 
In a developmental toxicity study in rats, oral doses of 15 mg/kg of triphenyltin hydroxide during gestation days
1 to 7 prevented implantation. When administered from day 8 and onwards, the compound was fetolethal. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triphenyltin hydroxide on EPCRA section 313 pursuant
to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the carcinogenicity data and the developmental toxicity data for this chemical.

Measured aquatic acute toxicity data for triphenyltin hydroxide include a fathead minnow 96hour LC

50

 of 5.4 ppb, a bluegill 96hour LC

50

 of 23 ppb, a rainbow trout 96hour LC

50

 of 15 ppb, and a marine green algae 72hour LC

50

 of 13.9 ppb. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing triphenyltin hydroxide on EPCRA section 313
pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(C) based on the environmental toxicity data for this chemical. 
270. 

Vanadium pentoxide

 (CAS No. 001314-62-1) (CERCLA; EPCRA EHS; RCRA APP8) (Ref. 8). Eighteen workers exposed to vanadium pentoxide dusts
at concentration in excess of 0.5 mg/m

3

 (0.0005 mg/L) for a period of up to 2 weeks developed respiratory symptoms that persisted for nearly 2 weeks after removal
from exposure. Inhalation of unspecified levels of vanadium pentoxide for 1 to 5 years produced asthma in 3 of 20 workers.
Mice and rats exposed to 1 to 3 mg/m

3

 (0.001 to 0.003 mg/L) vanadium pentoxide 6 hours/day for 3 months developed histopathologic changes in their lungs
and had a decrease in growth rate. EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing vanadium pentoxide on
EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section 313(d)(2)(B) based on the available chronic respiratory toxicity data
for this chemical. 
271. 

Vinclozolin (3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-5-ethenyl-5-methyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione)

 (CAS No. 050471-44-8) (FIFRA AI) (Ref. 3). The results of a 3month feeding study in Wistar rats administered
4,500 ppm (225 mg/kg/day; the only dose tested) indicate that vinclozolin interacts with numerous steroid hormones
in male and female animals. A broad spectrum of steroid hormones were affected in these animals, including increases
in adrenocorticotropic hormone, lutenizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone, corticosterone,
aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone and slight decreases in estradiol levels in males. Female rats had elevated
adrenocorticotropic hormone and luteinizing levels and depressed corticosterone and aldosterone levels, while
follicle stimulating hormone, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone and estradiol levels were comparable to
controls. After a 2month recovery period postdosing, all male hormone levels were normal except for a slight
elevation in FSH, and all female hormone levels were normal except for a slight elevation in estradiol. The endocrine
changes also were reported in developmental, subchronic, and chronic toxicity studies. 
A broad spectrum of organ changes occurred in dogs exposed to vinclozolin in a 1-year feeding study. Males administered
4.8 mg/kg/day (the LOEL for males) had increases in testes weights, increased bilirubin, and prostate atrophy. The
NOEL in males was 2.4 mg/kg/day. Females in this study had increased adrenal weights, lipid accumulation in the adrenal
glands, and marginally increased hemosiderin in the liver at 5.1 mg/kg/day (the LOEL for females). The NOEL for females
was 2.5 mg/kg/day. At higher doses (47 mg/kg/day in males and 53 mg/kg/day in females), there were increases in weights
of the liver, spleen, testes, adrenal, and thyroid. Other effects included increased diffuse hyperplasia of the
Leydig cells, lipid accumulation in the adrenal cortex, and increased platelets in males, and in females, slight
increases in mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. The oral RfD for this compound,
0.025 mg/kg/day, was based on the findings of a 6month feeding study with beagle dogs, in which adrenal weights
(absolute and relative) were significantly increased at 7.5 mg/kg/day (the LOEL). The NOEL was 2.5 mg/kg/day. Both
males and females exposed to higher doses (600 and 2,000 ppm, or 15 and 50 mg/kg/day) had histological changes in the
adrenal glands, including vacuolation of the zona fasciculata. In addition to effects on the adrenal gland, males
exposed to the LOEL dose and higher had decreased absolute kidney weights, and at 600 ppm, fat droplets in the distal
tubule were observed. 
Pseudohermaphroditism (a decrease in anal-genital distance) occurred in male offspring of rats administered doses
of 50 mg/kg (the LOEL) and higher by gavage. The developmental NOEL was 15 mg/kg. The same effect was noted in the offspring
of rats that received dermal applications of 180 mg/kg/day (LOEL; the developmental NOEL was 60 mg/kg/day) during
gestation, and also in a 2-generation reproduction study in rats (the LOEL was 86 mg/kg/day, the NOEL was 25 mg/kg/day).
Other developmental effects observed in the latter study included developmental delays, reduced male and female
pup weight, increased stillbirths and increased pup mortality throughout lactation. 
EPA believes that there is sufficient evidence for listing vinclozolin on EPCRA section 313 pursuant to EPCRA section
313(d)(2)(B) based on the available endocrine, adrenal, renal, hepatic, and developmental toxicity data.

are manufactured, processed, or otherwise used below the current reporting thresholds on EPCRA section 313. If EPA
were to add this type of chemical to EPCRA section 313, what modifications to EPCRA section 313, such as lowering the
reporting thresholds and modifying the 

de minimis

 in mixture exemptions, would be required to insure that release and transfer information would be collected? 
In Units IV.B.132., IV.B.144., and IV.B.158., of this preamble, EPA is proposing to add individually three diisocyanates:
hexamethylene-1,6-diisocyante; isophorone diisocyanate; and 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane).
EPA requests comment on its alternative proposal in Unit IV.B.132. of this preamble to create a diisocyanates category
rather than adding diisocyanates individually to EPCRA section 313. EPA also requests comment on what diisocyanates,
other than those listed in IV.B.132. of this preamble, should be included in such a category. 
EPA requests comment on its proposed definition of man-made mineral fibers, given in Unit IV.B.149. of this preamble,
and any other options for defining a fibers category. 
In Unit IV.B.166. and 172. of this preamble, EPA is proposing to add two ethylene bisdithiocarbamates (EBDCs): metiram;
and nabam. An additional two EBDCs, zineb and maneb, are currently listed on the EPCRA section 313 list of toxic chemicals.
The category of EBDCs has recently been added to EPCRA section 313 (December 1, 1993; 58 FR 63500). EPA requests comment
on the following: (1) Should the individual EBDCs, metiram and nabam, be added individually to EPCRA section 313 even
though they are members of the EBDC category, which is listed on EPCRA section 313; and (2) should the individual listings
for two EBDCs, zineb and maneb, be deleted and added as members of the newly created EBDC category? 
EPA requests comment on whether polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) should be added as a delineated category consisting
of the PACs listed in Unit IV.B.207. of this preamble or as a category with the definition given in Unit IV.B.207. of
this preamble. 
EPA requests comment on its approach in considering exposure as a part of its evaluation of certain chemicals under
sections 313(d)(2)(A) and (C).
In Units IV.B.36, 179., and 235. of this preamble, EPA is proposing to add three chemicals (sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and carbon monoxide) that are regulated by Title I of the CAA (Provisions for Attainment and Maintenance
of National Ambient Air Quality Standards). In addition, sulfur dioxide is regulated under Title IV of the CAA (Acid
Deposition Control). Extensive data, which are highly technical, are collected on these chemicals as required by
the CAA. EPA requests comment on the following: (1) Is the information collected under the CAA sufficient for public
right-to-know purposes; and (2) suggestions on how the data collected on these chemicals pursuant to CAA Titles I
and IV could be used to meet the purposes of EPCRA section 313.

Comments should be submitted to the address listed under the 
ADDRESSES unit. All comments must be received on or before April 12, 1994. 


VIII. Public Meeting 


EPA will hold a 1day public meeting to discuss the issues presented above. The tentative agenda for this public
meeting will include a discussion of the issues presented in Unit VII. of this preamable. 
Scheduling of oral statements will be on a first come first served basis by calling the telephone number listed under
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. All statements will be made part of the public record and will be considered in the
development of the final rule.

X. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 


A. Executive Order 12866


Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the
Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely to
result in a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.

Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant regulatory
action.'' As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions
or recommendations have been documented in the public record.




B. Regulatory Flexibility Act


The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' The analysis
supporting this proposed rule estimated the maximum cost that a small business might incur, and calculated the cost
impact percentage (reporting costs divided by average value of shipments) for each employee size, class, and SIC
code. 
Reporting costs are estimated at less than one percent of the average value of shipments per report in the first year,
and less than one-half of one percent of the value of shipments per report in subsequent years. The precise impacts
depend on how many reports an individual small business submits. However, experience with current reporters indicates
that small businesses generally submit fewer reports per facility than larger ones. Most of the reports are anticipated
to be submitted from industries with the lowest impacts. Because of this, no segment of the manufacturing sector is
likely to suffer significant adverse effects due to this rule, Therefore, EPA certifies that this proposed rule will
not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. 


C. Paperwork Reduction Act


The collection of information and other requirements under section 313 of EPCRA and section 6607 of the PPA are covered
under OMB approval number 20700093, which was issued on May 14, 1992. While this approval normally would have
expired on November 30, 1992, it remains in effect pursuant to the 1993 Department of Veteran Affairs and Housing and
Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 102389, signed October 6, 1992, which
states that:




Notwithstanding the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 or any requirements thereunder the Environmental Protection
Agency Toxic Chemical Release Inventory Form R and Instructions, revised 1991 version issued May 19, 1992, and related
requirements (OMB No. 20700093), shall be effective for reporting under section 6607 of the Pollution Prevention
Act of 1990 (Public Law 101508) and section 313 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (Public
Law 99-499) until such time as revisions are promulgated pursuant to law. 




This proposed rule adds chemicals to the list of toxic chemicals subject to reporting under section 313 of EPCRA and
section 6607 of the PPA and does not change the elements of the TRI reporting form, its instructions, or related requirements.
Accordingly, the Form R and Instructions and related requirements remain in effect, as provided by Pub. L. 102-389.
The industry reporting burden for collecting this information is estimated to average 53 hours per respondent annually,
including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data
needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The actual burden to a specific facility may
deviate from this estimate depending on the complexity of the facility's operations and the profile of the release.
Send comments regarding this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief,
Information Policy Branch, 2131, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and
to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 726 Jackson Place NW., Washington,
DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on this
collection of information.
