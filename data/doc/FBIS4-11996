  [Text] Paris, April 1 (AFP) -- The banned Islamic Salvation 
Front (FIS) has accused Algerian authorities of killing more 
than 200 civilians during anti-terrorist sweeps over the past 
few days, according to a statement received here Friday. 
  The head of the FIS abroad, Rabah Kebir, who normally lives 
in Germany, called on international human rights organisations 
to condemn what he said was a wave of killings. 
  A number of anonymous callers have also phoned AFP in Paris 
over the past few days to denounce what they say have been 
"kidnappings" and "killings" by the army. 
  "Amongst the many examples of barbarity (...), one notes 
over 
the past few days the assassination of 82 civilians in Blida, 
south of Algiers, of 120 others between Meftah and Sidi Moussa, 
east of Algiers," said the statement dated March 31. 
  "Not a day goes by without word of collective killings 
across 
the country (...) people are taken from their homes and then 
assassinated, slaughtered and their bodies abandoned in the 
streets to create an atmosphere of fear amongst the population," 
the statement said. 
  Women are also victims of such "institutional terrorism", 
the 
statement said, referring to the killing of two women wearing 
the Islamic veil at Boudaouaou, east of Algiers, on Tuesday. 
  Anonymous telephone callers said they had witnessed the 
"execution" of at least 10 people Wednesday at Les Eucalyptus, 
an Islamic fundamentalist stronghold in the southeast suburbs of 
Algiers. 
  The callers said the 10 were killed in reprisal for the 
death 
of 10 soldiers and para-military police caught in an ambush. 
  One caller said he had seen a man deliberately "run over" by 
a tank on the main street of Les Eucalyptus. 
  Algerian authorities have blamed the FIS for a wave of 
terrorist attacks in the country since January 1992 when general 
elections the Islamists were poised to win were annulled.
