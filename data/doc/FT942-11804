FT  04 MAY 94 / Remedies for a global sickness: Daniel Green looks at the
long-awaited start of restructuring in the international drugs industry
The pressures on the world's pharmaceuticals industry have exploded into
corporate action.
On Monday, Switzerland's Roche announced it would pay Dollars 5.3bn for US
drugs company Syntex. Yesterday, the Anglo-US company SmithKline Beecham
said it was buying Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a US company, for
Dollars 2.3bn. Within hours, US conglomerate Eastman Kodak said it wanted to
sell its three healthcare divisions, including Sterling Winthrop, which have
combined annual sales of Dollars 3.7bn.
On the surface each deal looks different. SmithKline Beecham is buying a
passport to the dispensers and prescribers of drugs. Roche will absorb a
research-based company like itself. And Kodak is escaping from the industry
entirely.
But they represent three distinct solutions to one problem: that drugs
companies' profits in the industrialised world are under pressure from
governments, employers and insurance companies determined to drive down
costs.
These pressures have been particularly acute in the US. The Clinton
administration has proposed sweeping healthcare reforms in an effort to cut
the cost of treating sick Americans - including the possibility of capping
drug prices, a move which would alter the economics of drug development,
which depend on high returns from heavy investment.
Though the reforms have not yet been fully debated, the price of drugs is
already being squeezed. Those who ultimately pay for the drugs - insurance
companies who meet claims and employers who pay premiums - are employing
intermediate companies, called healthcare management organisations or
pharmacy benefit managers, to negotiate discounts with drugs manufacturers.
Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive of SmithKline Beecham's since last week,
yesterday outlined four further causes for consolidation in the sector:
Attempts by governments in Europe and Japan to control pharmaceuticals
prices, which have depressed prices generally - even for drugs not
specifically targeted. The trend towards generic substitution in which drugs
buyers abandon a branded product in favour of a cheaper, unbranded
alternative. This has been a particular problem for Syntex: the company's
profits in recent years were based largely on the success of an
anti-inflammatory drug, Naprosyn. At its peak two years ago, Naprosyn's
annual sales peaked at Dollars 1bn, but in December last year, Naprosyn's
patent protection expired, and its sales fell by more than 50 per cent in
four months.
Therapeutic substitution, in which a cheaper drug, often non-branded, is
used on grounds of price. This could happen later this month when SB's ulcer
treatment, Tagamet, loses patent protection and doctors could choose it over
Glaxo's more expensive Zantac.
Escalating development costs. The increasing popularity of generic and
therapeutic substitution means that many companies are focusing on trying to
create unique products. As research into well-understood areas is dropped in
favour of pioneer work, more scientists have to be employed and subsequent
clinical trials are more expensive and time-consuming.
Most healthcare executives agree with this analysis of the pressures on
their industry. But while they agree on the causes, the executives of Roche,
SmithKline Beecham and Kodak disagree on strategy.
SmithKline Beecham's purchase, Diversified Pharmaceuticals Services, is a
pharmaceuticals benefit manager (PBM). Such institutions were born in the
1980s in the US with the aim of providing services to insurance companies
and employers in their dealings with hospitals and drugs companies.
Typically they process claims, offer ranges of drugs secured at discount
prices and substitute generic alternatives for more expensive branded
treatments.
SmithKline's deal is an echo of last summer's Dollars 6bn purchase by Merck,
the biggest US drugs company, of drugs distributor Medco, whose business is
similar to Diversified's. SmithKline began talking to Diversified's parent
company, United Healthcare, in August 1993, just weeks after the Merck-Medco
announcement. Because of their direct contacts with purchasers and doctors,
Medco and Diversified can promote their owners' drugs to doctors at the
expense of rival offerings.
Mr Leschly stresses that SmithKline's acquisition represents more than this,
however. He says that the future of the healthcare industry lies not simply
in treating diseases but in 'managing them' for a set fee per person over a
set period. With its acquisition of Diversified, SmithKline would become
involved in all stages of looking after health, he maintains.
The reasons for Roche's takeover of Syntex are more traditional, with no
overarching vision of a transformed world of healthcare. Mr Paul Freiman,
Syntex chairman, says his company's pipeline of drugs in development has
simply become too expensive for it to develop alone. The main drug in
development is Mycophenolate Mofetil, used to prevent rejection in organ
transplant patients, which cost 'about Dollars 50m a year, before overheads
and support'.
'At Dollars 400m, (last year's R&amp;D budget) we could probably not absorb all
of the products in our pipeline if we kept the spending at that level. We
had decided in our strategic plan that we needed alliances - from joint
ventures to buying small companies, to selling to a bigger company,' says Mr
Freiman.
Roche sees its acquisition of Syntex in an even more old-fashioned light: it
can cut Syntex's costs as it merges the operations of the two companies, and
it gains access to drugs still in development.
Roche is cagey about how many of Syntex's 10,000 employees will lose their
jobs. It insists that the acquisition is only the latest stage in a
seven-year strategy for US growth. This began in earnest in 1990 when it
bought the California biotechnology company Genentech for Dollars 2.1bn.
While Genentech was the gateway to the latest science of biotechnology,
Roche sees Syntex as a route to the US over-the-counter drugs market.
OTC is gaining in importance as a means of making the patient pay directly
for a treatment rather than through taxes, as in Europe, or insurance
premiums, as in the US. Roche is strong in OTC through its vitamins business
and should be able to boost the sales of Naprosyn in the wake of the
approval last month by the US Food and Drug Administration of an OTC
version.
For Kodak, it appears that neither alliances nor acquisitions are the right
solutions to the problem of falling drugs prices. Its way of addressing the
turmoil in the healthcare industry is to bid it farewell.
The company wants to concentrate on its core businesses and its move
yesterday is an acknowledgement that the Dollars 5.1bn acquisition of
Sterling Drug in 1988 was an error. Elf Sanofi, Sterling's European partner,
has already begun a strategic review with a view to buying all or part of
Sterling. Asset sales of its own are possible, 'given the size of a possible
transaction,' it said.
There is no shortage of potential deals in the healthcare industry while the
pressures on profits remain. Companies in a similar position to Syntex
include Upjohn, the US company which has seen patent run out on its
biggest-selling products in recent months, for example on Xanax, an
anti-depressive. Other potential buyers have the cashpile that Roche and
SmithKline have been spending. Top of the list is Glaxo, the biggest
European drugs company, which has yet to find a home for cash reserves of
more than Dollars 2bn. Chief executive Mr Richard Sykes said recently that
he intends to do a deal in the US by spring next year.
This week's shake-out may be seen in retrospect as just the beginning of a
long-awaited industry restructuring.
