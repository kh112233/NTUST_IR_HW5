13 people in the Basque province of Guipuzcoa for their 
suspected links with ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty]. This 
police operation also led to the discovery of a large arsenal of 
arms and explosives. Jesus Mari Esteban reports from San 
Sebastian: 
  Esteban: Good morning. This past weekend, in 
Guipuzcoa, members of the 513 Civil Guard Command arrested 13 
people suspected of links with the ETA terrorist band. 
According to a note just released by the office of the civil 
governor of Guipuzcoa, as a result of these arrests a large arms 
and explosives arsenal has been found, apparently belonging to 
ETA's San Sebastian commando unit. The arms store was discovered 
in the Guipuzcoa town of Usurbil, concealed in the home of a 
collaborator of the ETA unit. The arsenal comprises 40 
kilograms of explosives, several rifles, pistols, shotguns, 
grenades and other materiel. The first arrests were made during 
Saturday night, in Usurbil and Orio; seven more people were 
arrested in the early hours of this morning in Usurbil, Lasarte 
and Oyarzun.
