FT  12 NOV 93 / Jordan and Israel iron out accord
A SEVEN-MAN Jordanian economic delegation is reportedly holding talks in
Jerusalem with government officials and businessmen to iron out details of a
secret Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement which focuses on economic
co-operation.
According to the newspaper Maariv, the delegation is led by the businessman
who has the concession to operate Jordan's Aqaba port and includes
representatives of Jordan's two leading banks, financial advisers and
experts on sea and land transport. The delegation, which crossed the Allenby
bridge into Israel on Wednesday, will also visit Israel's port at Eilat.
The delegation's arrival follows statements by Israeli government ministers
and officials that an agreement has already been negotiated and initialled
during secret talks between Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, and
King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan in Amman last week.
Foreign ministry officials have refused to confirm the meetings, saying only
they expect the agreement to be signed early next year.
In return for signing, Jordan will apparently get relief from the US on its
Dollars 6.5bn (Pounds 4.3bn) external debt, beginning with Dollars 360m of
military debt.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, who is visiting Washington for
talks with President Bill Clinton and congressmen, will press the US to help
with Jordan's indebtedness and to arrange a signing ceremony in Washington.
King Hussein is expected to visit Washington within weeks.
Under the agreement, Israel and Jordan will open their borders, establish
full diplomatic relations and start joint projects in tourism, transport and
energy. Disputed Israeli-held land around the Dead Sea and Arava desert will
be formally handed to Jordan but leased back to Israel for a long term at a
nominal price.
In anticipation of a signing, Israel disclosed yesterday it was already
planning air and road links to Jordan.
