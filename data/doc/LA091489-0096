THE STATE; 
7 CARS IN FUEL TRAIN DERAIL 
Seven tank cars loaded with liquefied petroleum gas derailed near Byron in 
Contra Costa County, forcing evacuation of 15 homes, when one of the tankers 
leaked a mixture of propane and butane through a broken valve. Emergency crews 
stopped the leak, and no one was hurt. The Oakland-bound, 33-car train jumped 
the rails about 45 miles east of San Francisco. Southern Pacific Railroad 
spokesman Andy Anderson blamed a "mechanical failure" under one of the cars for 
the accident.
