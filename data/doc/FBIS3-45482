  [Text] Through several years of efforts, Hunan has made 
major headway in family planning, and a marked change has taken 
place in four aspects. 
  First, the masses' concept about birth has changed and their 
concept about family planning has improved. In particular, 
because the masses have attained a better understanding of the 
reform and opening up policy, and few and optimal births as well 
as late marriage have become a habit among young people in some 
localities. According to statistics from the provincial 
statistical bureau, married couples of child-bearing age who 
only wish to have one or two children for the rest of their life 
account for 77 percent. In 1992 the one-child rate was 67.9 
percent of the children born in that year. 
  Second, the province's excessive population growth has been 
effectively controlled. In 1992 it was reduced by nine per 
thousand compared with 1987, the family planning rate increased 
by 21.7 percent, and the multiple-birth rate dropped by 
approximately 13.3 percent. The two children and multiple-birth 
rates have been basically changed. 
  Third, family planning work standards have improved. Most 
localities in the province pay attention to family planning. 
  Fourth, the province's population growth rate is approaching 
the country's advanced level. In 1992 the province's family 
planning ranked in the forefront of two digit localities in the 
country's provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. 
According to an estimate, in 1993 the province could fulfill 
the state's population control program.
