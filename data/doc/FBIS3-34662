  [Text] Cairo, Feb 11 (AFP)--Egyptian security forces 
recently foiled a bid by Islamic militants to assassinate 
President Husni Mubarak, a pro-fundamentalist newspaper reported 
here Friday. 
  AL-SHA'B said nine militants of the outlawed al-Jama'ah al- 
Islamiyah group, currently on trial in a military court, planted 
explosives at Sidi Barrani airport near the Libyan border and at 
Mubarak's residence at the town's military base. 
  They planned to detonate them during a visit by Mubarak, who 
holds regular meetings with Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi 
at the base. 
  AL-SHA'B said the trial of the nine accused began in secret 
at the Sidi Barrani military court on January 30. 
  The plot was uncovered when a al-Jama'ah militant was 
arrested in a raid in the southern suburbs of Cairo on January 
19. The militant, who was wounded in the raid, made a full 
confession in hospital under the influence of drugs, the paper 
said. 
  It is the second assassination plot against Mubarak to be 
revealed by the opposition press in Egypt. In October two 
militants among a group of 19 who planned to kill the Egyptian 
leader were sentenced to death by the Alexandria high military 
court. 
  Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah has urged tourists and foreign 
investors to quit the country, saying it is stepping up its 
violent campaign against the authorities. 
  Almost 300 people have died since the fundamentalists began 
a 
campaign two years ago, aimed at toppling the government and 
installing an Iranian-style Islamic republic.
