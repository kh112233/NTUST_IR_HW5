FT  07 JUN 93 / Liberian rebels slaughter 300
Liberian rebels slaughtered about 300 refugees early yesterday at an
abandoned rubber plantation outside Monrovia in an 'orgy of killing and
mutilation', a United Nations official said, AP reports from Abidjan, Ivory
Coast.
The official, Mr Augustine Mahiga, representative of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, said about 755 people were injured in the attack,
at Kata, a refugee camp 35 miles north-east of the capital.
Liberia has collapsed into civil war since guerrillas led by Mr Charles
Taylor crossed from the Ivory Coast in December 1989.
