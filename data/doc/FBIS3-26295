  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Malaysia will 
set up several tourist representative offices in China to 
promote tourism and investment businesses. 
  Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have been chosen as the 
sites 
for the offices, deputy minister of culture, arts and tourism 
Chan Kong Choy said here today. 
  He said the number of Chinese tourists to Malaysia rose to 
about 90,000 in 1993 from 46,811 in 1992.
