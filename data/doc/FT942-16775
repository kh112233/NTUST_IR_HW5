FT  08 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Background noise told to quiet
down
Many employees of industrial companies, such as chemical plants or
papermills, literally cannot hear themselves think. Now a US company has
developed a communications system for hazardous and industrial areas where
the handset eliminates 75 per cent of the background noise. Developed by
GAI-Tronics, of Reading, Pennsylvania, the Europage combines an intercom and
a public address system.
