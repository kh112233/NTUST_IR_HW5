STAGE REVIEW; 
UNFLINCHING PURPOSE GUIDES ELOVICH PLAY 
Richard Elovich is not the first observer to compare the scourge of AIDS with 
the genocide of the Third Reich. 
In his one-man play, "If Men Could Talk, the Stories They Would Tell," Elovich 
juxtaposes the attitudes and emotional states of men facing death in these two 
historically disparate but arguably parallel situations. 
"Nothing works faster than fear," is his litany, but his subtext might read: 
"An individual's courage is equal to the specter of death." 
Elovich plays all six characters in his 70-minute tour de force at Sushi 
Performance Gallery, the second offering of this year's Neofest. It is no 
coincidence that the New York actor enters to the somber strains of a Bach 
Invention, since Elovich moves from one personage to another with the graceful 
facility of Baroque counterpoint. He projects serene composure, even when 
expressing rage, and his unself-conscious basso sets up a compelling cadence. 
Danny, a Jewish AIDS patient around whom the drama evolves, is treated by a 
Czech physician who is a survivor of Theresienstadt, Hitler's penultimate way 
station for Czech Jews on their way to annihilation. Because Danny is a 
comic-book illustrator by trade, the doctor wants Danny to document the 
doctor's experiences under the Nazis, which he narrates in great detail to his 
patient. 
Joseph, the flamboyant, gay biology teacher, is simultaneously the doctor's 
volunteer assistant, Danny's buddy during his declining health, and Danny's 
unrequited love interest from some unspecified, earlier student days. 
But, despite the eloquence that pervades Elovich's paean to survival, the 
artifice of coincidence mitigates his play's higher aspirations. That this 
single character should so seamlessly integrate Danny and the doctor seems 
cloyingly convenient. 
In a different context, where the characters' Jewish identity were not a 
central theme, Joseph would be an archetypal Christ figure, the compassionate 
servant ridiculed by society. Joseph may be Elovich's alter ego, because the 
program notes make no small issue of Elovich's commitment to political action 
on behalf of those living with HIV infection. By the play's conclusion, Joseph 
has moved from helpful volunteerism to an act of political confrontation. 
But this easy moral is only a part of 
Elovich's parable. The title comes from the play's last line, Danny's sad 
reflection about his father's silence. In a brief sketch, Elovich has Danny's 
mother interpreting his father's stony poses to her son. Elovich is far from 
silent, and his play is also a plea for men to break out of the emotional 
ghetto of masculine stoicism. 
Like most performance artists, Elovich writes his own material, but he wisely 
enlisted Cecil MacKinnon to direct and Michael Stiller to light his production. 
Under MacKinnon's cleanly analytical direction, Elovich traversed the sparse 
stage -- austerely occupied by a few chairs, a sleeping bag and an ominous 
hospital operating table -- with unflinching purpose. 
"If Men Could Talk, the Stories They Could Tell" which was first performed 
earlier this year in New York's Performance Space 122, ends its three-day run 
at 8 o'clock tonight at Sushi.
