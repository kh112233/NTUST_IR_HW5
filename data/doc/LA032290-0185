Pete Rose, former manager of the Cincinnati Reds, is cooperating with a federal 
investigation into his income taxes in hopes of avoiding a prison term, the 
Cincinnati Post reported. 
The paper reported that prosecutors are considering filing charges of failing 
to report income rather than income tax evasion in exchange for Rose's 
cooperation. 
Conviction on the evasion charge carries a maximum five-year sentence with a 
$250,000 fine. Failure to report income is punishable by a maximum of three 
years and a $250,000 fine.
