  [Text] The financial events that occurred in the country 
on Friday, when the U.S. dollar exchange rate closed at 124 
bolivares, alerted intelligence organizations that drug 
traffickers were offering dollars for between 80 and 100 
bolivares. Military intelligence sources are currently 
investigating the criminal activities carried out in Caracas, 
Maracaibo, Merida, San Cristobal, Puerto Ordaz, and Porlamar. 
  Confidential reports, which are being thoroughly 
investigated, warn about the presence of intermediaries used by 
leading cartels from the neighboring country, who reportedly 
offered dollars for between 80 and 100 bolivares, taking 
advantage of the confusion unleashed by a sudden increase in the 
dollar's value. The transactions involved attempts to launder 
large amounts of money that international drug organizations 
keep stashed along the Venezuelan border and introduce to the 
market in small amounts. 
  The confidential report talks about the mobilization of a 
considerable sum of "dirty" dollars resulting from drug 
operations carried out in Medellin, Cali, and Cucuta. The 
report indicates that, in a process like this, Venezuela is 
essential for illegal dollar transactions carried out by such 
criminal organizations.
