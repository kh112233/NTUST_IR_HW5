 

The Proposal 




The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to realign Jet Route
J15 to include the Twin Falls, ID, VORTAC. This would enhance traffic flow and reduce controller workload on
a frequently used high altitude route. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18,
1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The jet route listed in this
document would be published subsequently in the Order. 

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive 
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February
26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal.
Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that
this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
