Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5)(21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 4B4424) has been filed by the Registration and Consulting Co. AG, c/o Mr. Reynaldo A. Gustilo,

in 178.3297 

Colorants for Polymers

 (21 CFR 178.3297) to provide for the safe use of 8,9,10,11-tetrachloro-12H-phthaloperin-12-one (C.I. Solvent
Red 135) as a colorant in polyethylene phthalate polymers intended for use in food-contact articles and complying
with 21 CFR 177.1630. 


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before September

to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number

supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
