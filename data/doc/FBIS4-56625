  [Text] Brasilia, 4 May (EFE) -- Brazilian President Itamar 
Franco today praised his future South African counterpart, 
Nelson Mandela, for his victory in the recent elections and for 
his epic fight in favor of democracy and against racial 
discrimination. 
  Franco, who is 62, sent Mandela a 62-line message stating 
that his victory revitalizes freedom, and represents a sign of 
hope for humankind and a historic deed for South Africa that 
will have repercussions over the entire African continent. 
  Franco told Mandela: "The long epic battle Your Excellency 
and the African National Congress have fought against racial 
discrimination has been closely followed from this side of the 
Atlantic Ocean, with a profound spirit of solidarity." 
  Franco pointed out that the new political panorama will make 
it possible to promote bilateral relations and cooperation, the 
potential of which he considers to be unexplored. 
  In a note sent to current South African President Frederick 
de Klerk, Franco praised his stature as a statesman, which made 
possible the transition process culminating in the installation 
in South Africa of a multiracial democracy. 
  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will represent the Brazilian 
president at Mandela's installation ceremony, which will be held 
in the South African capital on 10 May.
