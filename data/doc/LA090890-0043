SHIITE PRISONERS NOW REPORTED IN IRAN'S HANDS 
Most of the 15 Shiite Muslims imprisoned in Kuwait on terrorism charges and 
whose fate was linked to that of two U.S. hostages held in Lebanon have been 
handed over to Iran following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a Lebanese magazine 
said Friday. 
The magazine Ash Shiraa, which broke the Iran-Contra scandal, said most of the 
15 Shiites, members of the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad, are now in Iran. 
Most of them are Iraqi Shiites. (There originally were 17, but two of the 
prisoners were released last year, having served their sentences.) They were 
serving different sentences for attempting to bomb the U.S. and French 
embassies and Kuwait's oil refineries. 
Imprisonment of the 15 is widely cited as one of the factors triggering a wave 
of abductions of Westerners in Lebanon. 
Islamic Jihad, a radical group that claimed responsibility for kidnaping U.S. 
citizens Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland, had demanded the release of the 
15 prisoners in exchange for freeing the two U.S. captives. The government of 
Kuwait had rejected these conditions. 
Ash Shiraa said some of the 15 escaped on the first day of Iraq's invasion of 
Kuwait, and one showed up in his native Lebanese village of Yattir, 10 miles 
south of Beirut. The remaining 14 were handed over to Iran by Iraq, the 
magazine said. 
Previous reports said that when the Iraqi army invaded Kuwait, it seized the 
prisoners.
