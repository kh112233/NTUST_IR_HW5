FOWLIE LAWYERS SAY 9 DRUG-CASE CHARGES INVALID 
Defense lawyers and prosecutors in the marijuana smuggling case against Daniel 
James Fowlie sparred in court Monday over whether Fowlie was being improperly 
charged with felonies that were not part of his extradition from Mexico. 
Attorneys James Brustman and G. David Haigh argued before U.S. District Judge 
Alicemarie Stotler that their client was not extradited to the United States in 
July to face all 26 counts filed in 1987. 
Haigh and Brustman say nine charges, including operating a continuing criminal 
enterprise and making illegal money transfers, have no equivalent in Mexican 
law, hence Fowlie cannot face such charges in the United States. They said the 
Mexican authorities returned Fowlie only to face the drug smuggling 
allegations. 
But Assistant U.S. Atty. Elana S. Artson contended that Fowlie's extradition 
from a prison in La Paz in July was for all 26 counts -- charges that she said 
are part of the U.S. extradition treaty with Mexico. She said the only way 
Fowlie could challenge the extradition was in a Mexican court. 
Stotler began hearing arguments and taking testimony on Fowlie's extradition 
order Monday at the federal courthouse in Santa Ana. The defense seeks to have 
the nine counts in question dismissed. Testimony resumes today. 
According to a 32-page indictment, Fowlie, 57, is accused of income-tax 
evasion, distributing or intending to distribute about 53,000 pounds of 
marijuana, failing to report the shipment of hundreds of thousands of dollars 
overseas and operating a continuing criminal enterprise. 
Investigators suspect that Fowlie operated one of the largest marijuana 
smuggling operations in the United States from 1982 to 1986, using rented 
warehouses in Orange County and Rancho del Rio, a 213-acre property on the 
Orange County-Riverside County line.
