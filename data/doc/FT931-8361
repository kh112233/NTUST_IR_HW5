FT  19 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Zantac continues to lift Glaxo
ZANTAC, an ulcer treatment and the world's best-selling drug, was the main
reason for Glaxo's surprisingly good interim results, announced yesterday.
The drug's sales increased by Pounds 145m to Pounds 1.03bn, providing 45 per
cent of Glaxo's turnover growth.
Dr Ernest Mario, chief executive, said: 'People have been talking about the
demise of Zantac for the last six years. It's still doing well and it's
continued improvement is not a flash in the pan.'
Zantac's growth had been assisted by strong expansion in the US (up 14 per
cent) and Europe (up 18 per cent).
Although the drug was losing some world market share - 39 per cent in 1992,
compared with 40 per cent in 1991 - the market was still grow-ing at 14 per
cent, said Dr Mario.
Sales of respiratory products increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 512m,
representing 22 per cent of group turnover. The overall respiratory market
is growing at 13 per cent.
Dr Mario said there had been a 15 per cent fall in sales in the US due to
wholesale stocking in anticipation of price increases. European respiratory
sales increased by 16 per cent.
Sales of Ventolin, Glaxo's old asthma treatment, fell 1 per cent (4 per cent
at constant exchange rates) to Pounds 239m. Beconase, the newer asthma
medicine, increased 9 per cent to Pounds 223m.
Serevent, Glaxo's latest asthma treatment, added Pounds 9m sales to total
Pounds 32m. Mr Mario said this would be a big product - it had yet to be
launched in the US, Japan or Germany, the world's three largest markets.
Antibiotic sales increased by 21 per cent per cent. Zinnat, an oral
antibiotic, increased sales by 49 per cent to Pounds 160m.
Sales of Zofran, the anti-nausea treatment, rose 36 per cent, from Pounds
120m to Pounds 163m. US sales increased by 42 per cent.
Imigran, a migraine drug also known as Imitrex, generated sales of Pounds
35m. The full-year figures will include the first contributions from Germany
and the US.
The migraine treatment has been predicted by analysts to achieve outstanding
sales. However, Dr Mario warned the drug's use would not grow explosively.
The speed of registration had been disappointing, particularly in the US.
Research and development expenditure grew to Pounds 335m (Pounds 277m) and
was expected to reach about Pounds 735m (Pounds 595m) by the year end. The
group spends more than any other pharmaceuticals company on R&amp;D.
Operating margins for the first six months were 33 per cent, but were likely
to fall to 31 per cent because of additional marketing costs associated with
new drug launches, particularly in the US.
Investment income from Glaxo's Pounds 1.5bn cash-pile was Pounds 79m (Pounds
77m).
Dr Mario said if the group could find a reasonable investment for its cash
it would make it. There was little point in distributing funds to
shareholders because of the advanced corporation tax implications.
Earnings per share increased by 16 per cent from 16.7p to 19.4p, while
earnings per ADR rose 17 per cent to 68 cents (58 cents). The dividend is an
improved 7p (6p).
