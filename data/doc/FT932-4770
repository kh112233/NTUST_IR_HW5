FT  08 JUN 93 / Radio factory for N Ireland
CARMEN Electronics, the South Korean car radio manufacturer, is to create
257 jobs at a new factory in Northern Ireland. The company said yesterday
that it was investing Pounds 9.5m at a site being developed by the
Industrial Development Board at Dungannon, County Tyrone, an unemployment
blackspot.
Carmen, whose equipment is sold in the UK under the Goodmans name, will be
making car stereos at the plant and expects to complete its local
recruitment by 1996. The IDB said it had secured the project in the face of
stiff competition from several other European countries.
