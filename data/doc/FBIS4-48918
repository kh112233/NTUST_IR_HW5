  [Text] Guangzhou, April 29 (XINHUA) -- China's 
trans-provincial population movement over the recent few years 
has helped reduce population growth instead of adding to the 
population pressure, according to a recent survey published here 
today. 
  Based on the fourth national population census and the 
random 
survey of areas with the largest number of migrants, the survey 
is conducted by the family planning department of Guangdong 
Province. 
  The survey concludes that the general birth rate of the 
flowing population is 34.5 per thousand lower than the 
non-floating population and the peak child-bearing age is 28, 
two years later than the non-floating population. 
  China's population began to flow into cities and developed 
coastal areas in the early 1980s when China started its rural 
reform. 
  Government sources said that up to 110 million farmers have 
left their land for industry and services in cities and some 20 
million people have been in trans-provincial movement. 
Guangdong Province has the largest number of migrants. It was 
estimated that there are more than 10 million migrants, mostly 
women, accounting for one sixth of the total permanent residents 
in the province. 
  Jiang Xiaodong, an official from Guangdong Provincial Family 
Planning Commission, said, generally speaking, the population 
movement is favorable for pushing the family planning policy. 
  He said that by moving into cities, the rural people have to 
spend most of their time improving their living standards and 
skills in order to struggle to survive keen competition and this 
compels them to delay their marriage and control birth. 
  By moving into cities, he said, rural residents have to 
accept the new ideas and new habits of living, thus making it 
favorable for them to break away from the traditional ideas 
about marriage and birth.
