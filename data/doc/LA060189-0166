FINANACIAL MARKETS; 
AMGEN STOCK RISES SHARPLY ON FDA RUMOR 
Amgen's stock climbed Wednesday in heavy trading on rumors that the Thousand 
Oaks biotechnology company would receive Food and Drug Administration approval 
today to sell its promising anti-anemia drug erythropoietin. 
Amgen's stock rose $1.625 to close at $40.125 on volume of 462,000 shares 
traded on the NASDAQ System. 
Analysts have estimated the eventual size of the domestic market for EPO at 
$450 million to more than $1 billion a year. 
Richard Bock, biotechnology analyst for Sutro &amp; Co., said the widespread 
rumor Wednesday was that FDA approval of EPO was imminent and "judging by the 
price action on Amgen, that's what is most likely." 
Engaged in Race 
Amgen Chief Executive Gordon Binder said the FDA has called a press conference 
today to announce its approval of a new drug. Binder would not comment on 
whether EPO would be approved for sale. 
Binder did say that both Amgen and FDA officials "have been working very hard, 
including over the holiday weekend." EPO is Amgen's first commercial drug. 
Amgen is in a race with Chugai-Upjohn, a Chicago biotechnology rival that has 
submitted its own EPO application to the FDA.
