  [Text] United Nations, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The UN Security 
Council adopted a resolution today to pave the way for 
Secretary- General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to send a reconnaissance 
team to Aouzou strip, a disputed area between Libya and Chad. 
  On April 4, Libya and Chad signed an agreement concerning 
the 
practical modalities for the implementation of the judgment 
delivered by the international court of justice regarding the 
Aouzou strip. 
  They agreed that the withdrawal of Libyan administration and 
troops from Aouzou should start on April 15, under the 
supervision of a mixed team of 25 Chadian officers, 25 Libyan 
officers and UN observers. 
  Butrus-Ghali wrote to the Security Council Wednesday on his 
intention to send a reconnaissance team to the area to conduct a 
survey of conditions on the ground for the possible deployment 
of UN observers to monitor the Libyan withdrawal. 
  Noting that the team would travel to Libya by UN aircraft, 
the Security Council decided that paragraph 4 of Resolution 748, 
which imposed sanctions, including aviation embargo, on Libya, 
should not apply in respect of the UN aircraft flying to or from 
Libya for the purpose of conveying the team. 
  Resolution 748 was adopted in March 1992 because of Libya's 
refusal to hand over to the United States and Britain two Libyan 
suspects for the Pan Am jet bombing over Scotland in 1988 which 
killed 270 people.
