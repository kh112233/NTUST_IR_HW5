ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to reintroduce the gray wolf (

Canis lupus

), an endangered species, into Yellowstone National Park, which is located in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. This population
would be classified as a nonessential experimental population according to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (Act). Gray wolf populations have been extirpated from most of the western United States. They
presently occur in a small population in extreme northwestern Montana, and as incidental occurrences of a few wolves
in Idaho, Wyoming, and Washington that result from the dispersal of wolves from Montana and Canada. This reintroduction
is being proposed to reestablish a viable wolf population in the Yellowstone area, one of three wolf recovery areas
that have been identified in the Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan. Potential effects of this proposed rule
were evaluated in an environmental impact statement completed in May 1994. This gray wolf reintroduction would not
conflict with existing or anticipated Federal agency actions or traditional public uses of park lands, wilderness
areas, or surrounding lands.
