PACIFIC NOTES 
Texas Instruments Inc. and Thai Airways have announced that they are jointly 
developing an advanced computer system dubbed EXPICS that will enhance the 
scheduling of flight operations. 
TI said it will provide engineering services, computer hardware and software, 
training and systems integration, while Thai will contribute experts in 
operations control, data processing and communications. 
The new system -- EXPert Irregularity Control System -- will use updated 
computer displays to alert controllers to disruptions in the flight schedule 
and allow them to quickly test various alternatives. 
TI said its agreement with Thai Airways will allow it to market the system to 
other carriers.
