LEAD IN PAINT FORCES RECALL OF SLINKY TOYS 
More than 40,000 Slinky animal pull toys have been recalled because paint used 
on them may contain too much lead, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said. 
The agency also says 234,000 clown dolls are being recalled because they pose a 
choking hazard. The dolls, manufactured by Omaha-based Oriental Trading Co. and 
sold through mail order catalogues as the "Dress Up Clown" or "Funny Clown," 
were recalled because they have small parts that present a choking risk to 
young children.
