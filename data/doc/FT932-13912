FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Tobacco setback at Philip Morris
PHILIP Morris, which set alarm bells ringing over branded products when it
announced a sharp price cut for its flagship Marlboro cigarettes, yesterday
reported a fall in profits from its domestic tobacco division in the first
quarter of 1993.
The US tobacco, food and brewing company said the division, which
traditionally accounts for more than half of group operating profits, made
Dollars 1.016bn at the operating level, down from Dollars 1.027bn in the
same period of 1992.
Operating revenues for the division were 4.2 per cent higher at Dollars
2.54bn, but domestic cigarette shipments were down by 1.1 per cent.
Marlboro, the best-selling cigarette brand in the US and whose market
position has been threatened by the explosive growth in discount cigarettes,
saw an 8.3 per cent fall in shipments, to 22.6bn units.
The inroads being made by discount cigarettes - which Philip Morris
suggested yesterday account for 39 per cent of the US cigarette industry -
prompted the group to announce the effective price cut of about 40 cents a
packet for Marlboro.
At the time, Philip Morris warned that the move could cut operating profits
from its domestic tobacco unit by as much as 40 per cent this year.
The US tobacco division, contributed to an overall 10.8 per cent advance in
Philip Morris's first-quarter profits after tax, at Dollars 1.22bn, a much
slower growth rate than the company has reported in recent years. Total
revenues were up by 8.1 per cent at Dollars 15.2bn.
The international tobacco operations saw a sharp 18 per cent operating
profits rise, at Dollars 675m.
On the food side, the US businesses improved by 14.7 per cent, to Dollars
626m, while the international food division reported a 10.5 per cent gain,
at Dollars 242m.
The beer division made operating profits of Dollars 93m, up from Dollars 81m
a year ago.
