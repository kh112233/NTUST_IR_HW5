FT  08 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Volkswagen
Seen from Wolfsburg, Volkswagen is taking advantage of a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity to grab European market share; shifting a big chunk of its cost
base out of the D-Mark; and building a set of neatly segmented brands to end
forever the slur that it is a single marque/single platform company.
But by moving into east Germany and Czechoslovakia, boosting its presence in
Spain and investing in China and Mexico, VW is doing shareholders no
short-term favours. It is lavishing money - DM42bn over the next five years
 -on plants around the world; it is making only small inroads into its
German cost problem; and, to start with at least, its brand portfolio will
prove costly and confusing to customers. At a time when the German car
market is booming as rarely before, the benefits are not coming through to
the bottom line. Yesterday, VW reported that first quarter German sales -
probably the most profitable part of the group's output - were 52 per cent
higher than a year before. Yet pre-tax profits actually fell, admittedly
after hefty transfers to reserves.
Whether its gamble eventually pays off for shareholders depends on how much
of that DM42bn capital spending is met out of the cash flow of the operating
businesses. But for at least three of those subsidiaries, in Czechoslovakia,
Argentina and China, tossing a coin is probably as good a guide to the
outcome as any number of scrupulous cash-flow projections. With the share
price down 41 per cent since German economic union, the next money to be
made in VW shares will go to those who guess which way the coin is coming
down.
