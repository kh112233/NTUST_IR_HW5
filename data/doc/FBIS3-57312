  [Text] Moscow, 25 Jan -- The Russian side is concerned 
about the mass violations by Japanese fishing vessels of Russian 
territorial waters near the island of Kunashir which could 
complicate relations between Russia and Japan, Mikhail Demurin, 
the deputy director of the Press and Information Department of 
the Russian Foreign Ministry, said at a briefing today. 
  He said that on 21 January over 50 Japanese boats 
demonstratively entered Russian territorial waters and remained 
there for over five hours against the demands of border guards 
that they leave. The next day 30 Japanese boats again violated 
Russian waters. 
  The Russian foreign policy department spokesman said that 
the 
Russian Foreign Ministry made a representation regarding this to 
the Japanese embassy in Moscow. It voiced deep concern over the 
violations and demanded that the Japanese side take effective 
measures to prevent them. 
  "Our concern is all the more serious because the violations 
are taking place on the eve of bilateral consultations at deputy 
foreign minister level and also on the eve of the sitting of the 
peace treaty working group," Mikhail Demurin stressed.
