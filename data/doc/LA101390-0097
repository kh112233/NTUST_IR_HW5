QUAYLE BACKS LIMIT ON CONGRESS TERMS 
Vice President Dan Quayle on Friday joined the political bandwagon to limit the 
terms of officeholders, proposing that members of Congress be forced to retire 
after a specific number of terms. 
"Everywhere I go, I come across a spirit of real disappointment with 
Washington," Quayle said in a speech prepared for delivery in Louisville, Ky. 
"The people are restless. Congress' recent budget spectacular has only added 
fuel to the feeling of 'Let's get rid of the rascals.' " 
Quayle's comments came as the Bush Administration sought to represent Congress 
as the roadblock to a budget agreement and deflect criticism heaped on 
President Bush in the past few days. 
A text of the vice president's speech to the Society of Professional 
Journalists was released by his office in Washington. 
Quayle, who served 12 years in Congress, said in a TV interview last week that 
he has long favored limitations on the terms of officeholders. He did not 
propose a specific term limit in his speech Friday, but as a freshman 
congressman, he proposed a 12-year limit on both Senate and House members. 
"In my view, what is good for the President is good for the Congress," he said 
in his speech, referring to the constitutional amendment limiting the President 
to two terms.
