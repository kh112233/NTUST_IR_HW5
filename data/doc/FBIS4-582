  [Excerpt] The Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA] regime's air force and artillery once 
again massacred defenseless civilians in Cuanza Sul Province 
last weekend. In a vain attempt to occupy the area of Quilenda 
and surrounding communes, long range artillery and Sukhoi 
aircraft of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of 
Angola Air Force indiscriminately bombed civilians in the 
village of Pango, killing 10 women and children. The shelling 
was carried out from Waku Kungo. [passage omitted]
