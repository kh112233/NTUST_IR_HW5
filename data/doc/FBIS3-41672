``Europe Will Help Russia Conquer Cholera''] 
  [Text] Paris -- The European Community [EC] has decided to 
provide emergency humanitarian aid in the amount of 500,000 ecu 
($540,000) to vaccinate the population of the Russian Federation 
and Transcaucasian republics. 
  These resources were announced by the EC's chairman in 
Brussels and are intended for the purchase, shipment, and 
distribution of vaccines to prevent cholera, diptheria, 
tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, and even plague epidemics that the 
commission believes are threatening the Russian Federation and 
Transcaucasian region.
