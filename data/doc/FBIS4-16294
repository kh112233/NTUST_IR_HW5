  [Text] VILNIUS, 14 Apr, BNS -- The latest round of 
Lithuanian-Russian talks on border delimitation was "extremely 
unproductive," said Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Vladislovas Domarkas. Lithuanian and Russian negotiators met in 
Kaliningrad Wednesday [13 April]. 
  Domarkas, who headed the Lithuanian delegation, said the 
meeting was devoted to boundaries of territorial waters, land 
border and several versions of a draft agreement on 
Lithuanian-Russian state border. 
  Domarkas said completely no progress was made in any of the 
issues because "the demands were too high." 
  Zenonas Kumetaitis, head of the Lithuanian Geodesy Service, 
told Lithuanian TV that Russia unexpectedly decided to review 
border on the Kursiu peninsula. But in his words, sea border 
remains the main stumbling block in bilateral talks. 
  Lithuanian and Russian negotiators are scheduled to hold 
their next meeting after a month. 
  Domarkas said Lithuanian and Latvian delegations intend to 
discuss sea border problems at a round of talks 18 April.
