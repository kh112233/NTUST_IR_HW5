FT  02 JUL 92 / Survey of Merseyside (2): Numbers slim down to fit a smaller
economy - The changing structure
IN DECEMBER 1981 Merseyside County Council made a detailed forecast of
trends in the local economy, relating them to jobs. It was thought to be
scaremongering.
Merseyside had 619,000 jobs in 1977, but by 1981 the total was down to
560,000. The county council foresaw a range of possibilities for 1986 - the
year it was to be abolished by the government - from a high of 541,000 to a
low of 481,000. It hoped 10,000 jobs would come from inward investment and
new initiatives to put the probable level at 500,000.
In fact, the worst fears were realised. The 10 biggest sectors on Merseyside
in 1990 employed just over 400,000 people. The total of all sectors, about
20,000 higher, was an almost exact straight-line projection of the 'low'
forecast.
In half a generation, Merseyside has lost about a third of its jobs, the
bulk of them manual. The biggest employment sectors in the 1990s are largely
service-based, requiring an educated or skilled workforce.
Manufacturing, 202,000 strong in 1977, has been more than halved in size in
terms of jobs. In the modern - and almost full - environment of the new
strategic asset of Wavertree Technology Park, unskilled manual labour is not
required. The picture appears desperate for those displaced by Merseyside's
comprehensive economic restructuring, but - paradoxically - it is not as bad
as it looks.
Unemployment rates explain why. The volume of jobs lost since 1977 should
have given Merseyside a rate of nearly 40 per cent by now. In fact,
unemployment in May was 17 per cent, with 96,319 claiming benefit.
This is actually fewer than the 98,610 of November 1988, when the UK economy
was booming. But that was then 16 per cent of the Merseyside workforce.
Long-term and short-term, the figures can only mean one thing.
Professor Patrick Minford, Liverpool University's famous monetarist
economist, explains: 'Depopulation is proving the long-term solution. The
sort of jobs that have been coming in have been non-manual. This is a good
area for non-manual workers. It has good culture and nice housing stock.
'Manual workers have been looking elsewhere; first they commute to work in
other towns and cities and come back home at weekends, then they relocate
altogether. The collapse of the private housing market in London and the
south has helped because the rented sector there is now healthier and more
affordable.'
While depopulation ought theoretically to damage the tax base and local
spending power, this has not been the case because Merseyside's reshaped
economic structure is increasingly skilled, professional and middle-class.
There are fewer workers, but they are individually better paid, pushing up
overall earnings.
Coupled with lower costs and housing compared with the south, this helps
explain why Merseyside as a whole rarely looks like a place on its uppers.
Most people lead an affluent, comfortable life, in spite of the inner city's
struggle with decline.
This applies not only to professionally qualified or white-collar workers.
Mr Terry Greer is chief executive of Johnson Group Cleaners, founded in
Liverpool in 1817 and located in Bootle since 1896. It is a highly
successful, quoted company, with a thriving international business in the
US.
Its cleaning and industrial clothing rental business in Bootle is also group
headquarters. There are 360 employees on Merseyside out of Johnson's 5,000
in the UK. Local business has grown dramatically, but not jobs. Output
increases have come by training a highly flexible workforce with the skills
to deliver increasing productivity - and be paid commensurately.
Similar productivity improvements and staffing reductions have produced
flexible, mechanised, highly skilled and well-paid jobs in the docks and car
factories.
Meanwhile, white-collar areas such as governmental, financial and
professional services have grown because of Liverpool's low cost base. There
is usually a shortage of suitable staff. Royal Insurance is a principal
employer, while stockbrokers Charterhouse Tilney and BWD Rensburg have
strong local bases.
Successful law firms include Weightman Rutherfords, Alsop Wilkinson, Lace
Mawer, Mace &amp; Jones, and the rapidly emergent Bermans, which also boasts
busy offshoots in New York and Manchester and an associate office in
Glasgow.
Mr Ian Short of Bermans typifies the upbeat mood: 'There were 29 of us in
Liverpool in 1979. By 1986 we were up to 60 and we have more than doubled
that now. People talk of the need for incentives to attract investment but
we have never needed to lever a grant out of anyone.'
Like many others, Bermans takes training seriously and supports the
Merseyside training and enterprise council.
The USM-quoted company, Rathbones, has been a Liverpool business since
before 1742, when its records show it was already a successful timber
importer and merchant. For most of this century, it has offered personal
financial and fund management services, an extension of an original family
sideline through which its famous members found time for good works while
safeguarding the Rathbone fortune.
From about 10 people shortly after the war, there are nearer 200 now, spread
between offices in London and Liverpool.
According to Mr Sebastian Rathbone: 'Merseyside is a jolly good place to run
a business. The quality of people is high. They are not cheap, but they are
priced competitively and very loyal. Many of our staff have been here more
than 15 years; it makes for a better atmosphere in the office and for
reliability.
'Our strength is operating from a low cost area to sell our services
throughout the world.'
The sector which has come from nowhere, however, is tourism, once scoffed at
by some Labour politicians as unlikely to produce 'proper' jobs. Yet it now
employs some 14,000 on Merseyside, with others indirectly affected as
suppliers of services to the sector.
Merseyside had 29m visitors in 1990 - the last time tourism was measured
comprehensively - compared with 19m in 1985. Numbers of staying visitors -
they spend between Pounds 40 and Pounds 50 each compared with the Pounds 6
to Pounds 8 of day-trippers - nearly doubled to 3.5m.
Revenues from tourism in 1990 were Pounds 335m, compared with Pounds 223m in
1985. Last year, Merseyside's average hotel occupancy was 62 per cent, with
a July high of 74 per cent. The overall annual figures for Manchester and
Cheshire were less than 54 per cent.
Mr Samir Rihani, chief executive of Merseyside Tourism Board, says that 10
years ago tour companies used Liverpool as a cheap watering hole between
Chester and the Lake District, paying as little as Pounds 15 a night for
hotel rooms. The trade rate is more than Pounds 40 now, and the visitors are
more likely to stay two nights to take in the Albert Dock and Beatles and
other heritage attractions.
'It's all about bringing in money,' he says. 'Money equates to new jobs.'
The new industry has also created a new type of skilled operator. When
potential inward investors are shown round now, professional guides from the
tourism board do the job, well equipped to accentuate the positive. In spite
of unemployment, there seem plenty of plusses about.
