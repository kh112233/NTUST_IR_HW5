  [Text] The Haitian Antidrug Brigade announced on 28 April 
that on 26 and 27 April it carried out an important search 
operation that resulted in the arrest of seven traffickers 
wanted by the police and the questioning of 27 other persons. 
The operation led by this brigade, with the help of tracker dogs 
trained in the United States and mixed units of the capital 
police, resulted in the recovery of arms and ammunition and the 
seizure of an unassessed amount of marijuana. Among those 
arrested are two Colombians holding false Dominican passports 
and one Dominican. The three will very soon be extradited to 
their countries of origin. 
  The Haitian antidrug services have pointed out that 
Colombian 
citizen Orlando De Jesus Arena Alvarez, 44, who was extradited 
to Bogota on 20 April after he had been arrested following a 
four-year stay in Haiti under a false Venezuelan identity, had 
been sought by the Colombian Justice Department as one of the 
leaders of the Medellin Cartel.
