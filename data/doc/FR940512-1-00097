children less than six years of age). ***

Defective paint surfaces. 

For residential structures constructed before 1978, HUD shall cause the property to be inspected for defective paint
surfaces before offering the property for sale. Defective paint surfaces either must be tested for lead content and
abated as described in 35.24(b) of this title, if found to contain lead at concentrations equal to or exceeding
levels specified in 35.24(b)(3) of this title, or, if not tested, the presence of lead-based paint shall be
assumed and the defective paint surfaces abated as described in 35.24(b)(4) of this title. Abatement must
be completed before delivery of the property to the purchaser or, if the disposition program under part 290 of this
title provides for repairs to be performed by the purchaser, such treatment may be included in the required reports.
Residential structures assisted under section 223(f) of the National Housing Act are to be inspected and treated
as set forth in this paragraph. 

(c) *** Testing shall be performed using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis
of paint samples. Test readings of 1 mg/cm

2

 or higher using an XRF shall be considered positive for presence of lead-based paint. If the laboratory reports the
results in percent by weight, 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million (ppm) shall be considered positive. ***
Treatment shall consist of covering or removal of the paint surface in accordance with 35.24(b)(4) of this
title. Treatment shall be completed before delivery of the property to the purchaser, or, if the disposition program
under part 290 of this title provides for repairs to be performed by the purchaser, such treatment may be included in
the required repairs. 

(1) 

EBL child. 

In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, if HUD is presented with test results that indicate
a child less than six years of age living in a unit has an elevated blood lead level or EBL, HUD must either: 

(i) Test or cause to be tested the unit occupied by the child, and, if such test is positive for lead-based paint, abate
the unit surfaces in accordance with the methods set out in 35.24(b)(4) of this title; or 

(ii) If HUD chooses not to test the unit, HUD must abate all of the unit surfaces. 

(2) 

Abatement without testing. 

In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, in the case of a residential structure constructed
before 1978, HUD, at its option, may forego testing and abate all chewable surfaces in accordance with the methods
set out in 35.24(b)(4) of this title.
