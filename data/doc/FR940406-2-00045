Wolverine Hydroelectric Corp., Availability of Draft Multiple Project Environmental Assessment



March 31, 1994.





In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the applications for an original license for the Edenville, Secord, and Smallwood Hydroelectric Projects, located
on the Tittabawassee River, Gladwin County, Michigan and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for
the projects. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the proposed
projects and has concluded that approval of the projects, with appropriate mitigation or enhancement measures,
would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Please submit any comments within 30 days from the date of this notice. Comments should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell,
Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix
Project No. 10808, 10809, or 10810 to all comments as appropriate. For further information, please contact Charles
T. Raabe, at (202) 2192811.
