  [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- The European Union [EU] and 
Lithuania sign a preliminary free trade accord in Brussels 
Monday. 
  The agreement was initialed by Dalia Grybauskaite, director 
of the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry's Economics Division, and 
Daniel Gugenbul, who heads the EU's talks with Eastern and 
Central European countries. The procedure started at 1700 
Belgian time and lasted for quite a while because each of the 
agreement's 300 pages had to be signed in two copies, 
Grybauskaite said. 
  After initialing, the accord cannot be changed. The 
agreement is likely to be signed in early October and would come 
into force Jan. 1. 
  Lithuania became the second Baltic state to initial a free 
trade agreement with the EU. Latvia concluded a similar deal 
last week. Negotiations with Estonia are nearing completion.
