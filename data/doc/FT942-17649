FT  02 APR 94 / Scottish terminal nears completion
Scotland's Eurocentral freight terminal for the Channel tunnel is virtually
complete at Mossend in Lanarkshire.
When the tunnel opens one freight train a day will leave Mossend with
Scottish exports. It will be split up and mixed with trains from other
terminals across the UK, to form new trains des-tined for continental
Europe.
The Mossend terminal, which is near the M8 motorway and the enterprise zone
that has been created to help Lanarkshire recover from the disappearance of
its steel industry, has received a strong level of inquiries from
prospective users.
Personal-computer manufacturers and whisky companies are expected to use it
for continental shipments.
The terminal is about 400 miles from the Channel tunnel, the distance at
which rail freight is thought to become economic compared with road. This
advantage increases the further the trains penetrate into continental
Europe.
The terminal has been built by the Lanarkshire Development Agency - the
local enterprise company - at a cost of Pounds 8.6m.
It will be handed over to Railfreight Distribution, which will operate it.
The terminal consists of four sidings running alongside a large tarmac
expanse where containers will be moved from trailers to trains by
mobile-lift equipment. The containers will pass through the administration
block and under a gantry for a security inspection before Customs clearance.
The site is surrounded by a high security fence.
