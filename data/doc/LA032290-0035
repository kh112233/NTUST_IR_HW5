SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Seven members of the Black Federation picketed San Diego police headquarters 
Wednesday to protest what they call a hasty pronouncement of murder-suicide in 
deaths of two San Diego city schools' administrators. 
Members of the federation, which provides community services, also plan to 
picket the police station today, said Herb Cawthorne, chief executive officer 
of the organization. 
The pickets and other black community leaders object to police officials' 
preliminary conclusion that George Frey, 57, an assistant superintendent, 
killed Elizabeth (Betty) Tomblin, 43, director of the program evaluations 
department, and then shot himself. 
The two bodies were found early Sunday in Frey's home. Frey, who had been 
divorced three times, and Tomblin, who is married, had a romantic relationship, 
friends and police say. 
The preliminary findings were released after a 10-hour investigation. Police 
officials say the investigation is continuing. 
"We just want to make sure they carry out their pledge," Cawthorne said. "We 
just want them to know that simple (public relations) is not enough."
