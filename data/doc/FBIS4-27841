  [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- Japan will tell the 
International Court of Justice that it does not regard the use 
of nuclear weapons as a violation of international law, 
officials said Monday. 
  The ruling coalition endorsed the government's traditional 
view on the issue in an official statement to be submitted to 
the Hague- based International Court, they said. 
  The gist of the government's statement on the use of nuclear 
arms was approved by a meeting of coalition executives when it 
was presented to the meeting by the Foreign Ministry. 
  The statement is in response to the court's request that 
each 
country submit such a document by Friday. The court was asked 
in May by the World Health Organization (WHO) to decide whether 
or not staging a nuclear warfare violates international law. 
  WHO, inspired by growing concerns about the adverse effect 
any use of nuclear arms would have on people's health, sought 
the court's ruling on the issue. 
  In the statement, the government will also elucidate Japan's 
basic stance on nuclear arms as symbolized by the so-called 
three nonnuclear principles. 
  Japan has been holding strict antinuclear principles -- not 
making, possessing or introducing nuclear weapons to Japan -- as 
a national tenet since they were approved by the Diet in 1968. 
  Nagasaki, which suffered atomic bombing in 1945 after 
Hiroshima, has raised objection to the government's standing on 
the issue. 
  It presented a written request to Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata 
and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, calling on the government to 
denounce the use of nuclear arms as violation of international 
law. 
  Nagasaki argues in the document that the indiscriminate 
killing of people with atomic bombs clearly constitutes a 
violation of international law from a humanistic standpoint. 
  The city criticized the government for not fully 
acknowledging the devastating conditions in the A-bombed areas 
or the agony of the victims.
