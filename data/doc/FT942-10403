FT  11 MAY 94 / Aid for Rwanda refugees sought
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees yesterday appealed for
Dollars 56.7m (Pounds 37.9m) to cover the urgent needs of 860,000 refugees
who have fled ethnic strife in Rwanda and Burundi, writes Frances Williams
in Geneva. The appeal is intended to cover food, drinking water, shelter and
sanitation over the next three months for refugees now in Tanzania, Burundi,
Zaire and Uganda.
Two weeks ago, in the largest and swiftest exodus UNHCR has ever seen, some
250,000 people surged into north-western Tanzania in the space of 24 hours.
The UNHCR, which has set up a makeshift camp at Benaco 18km from the Rwandan
border, says it is still receiving 400-1,500 new refugees each day. Children
make up half Benaco's 250,000 population.
Only last week UNHCR said it would need Dollars 38.5m for refugee aid, but
the agency has revised upwards its immediate requirements as the numbers
escaping the civil war in Rwanda continue to grow.
Separately, Canada has asked for a special session of the UN Human Rights
Commission to discuss the atrocities in Rwanda, where up to 200,000 may have
died in recent weeks. If agreed by a majority of the 53 members, the
commission will meet later this month in Geneva.
Meanwhile, a report to the UN Security Council has proposed a new
peacekeeping force for Rwanda of at least 5,500 troops to support relief
operations and protect civilians.
It is unclear who would participate in such a force. The Security Council
recently voted to reduce its 2,500-strong peacekeeping contingent in Rwanda
to 270 after violence made it unable to function. About 450 remain.
