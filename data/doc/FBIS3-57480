  [Text] Moscow, 27 Jan--Over the past week, Japanese fishing 
vessels have violated Russian territorial waters about 100 
times, the press service of the border troops of the Russian 
Federation told an ITAR-TASS correspondent today. Border troops 
estimate that infiltrators are using the tactic of entering in 
groups and conducting constant radar and visual observation of 
Russian border vessels, leaving the territorial waters when they 
appear. The smugglers from Japan ignore signals by border 
guards to stop, including warning shots. 
  The press service notes that the ships and aircraft of the 
Russian border troops will take all measures envisaged under the 
law on the state border of the Russian Federation to protect 
Russian interests in its territorial waters and economic zone.
