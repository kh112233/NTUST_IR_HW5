  [Text] Lima, 1 Mar (EFE) -- Daniel Espichan Tumay, the 
Republic of Peru's special prosecutor for terrorist crimes, 
stressed today that by 18 February 1,699 terrorists had sought 
shelter under the Repentance Law issued by the government. 
  The prosecutor added that 1,055 belong to the Shining Path 
Maoist gang and 644 to the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA). 
  The prosecutor noted that thus far five repented terrorists 
have left Peru under a new identity in order to lead a different 
life in another country, thanks to the valuable information they 
supplied that allowed the breaking up of subversive groups. 
  Espichan added that he has been concerned about the defense 
of eight journalists under arrest for allegedly promoting 
terrorist crimes who belonged to the newspaper DIARIO DE MARKA, 
a leftist newspaper seized by the Shining Path that now 
circulates clandestinely from time to time in a very small 
format. 
  The Republic of Peru's special prosecutor pointed out that 
he 
has constantly been in touch with Journalists Association head 
Miguel Calderon Paz in order to individually handle the cases 
involving these journalists and quickly secure the release of 
those journalists who are not criminally liable. 
  The prosecutor also has recommended painstakingly checking 
reports supplied by the repented terrorists because some of them 
have been false and led to the detention of innocent people.
