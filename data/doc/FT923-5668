FT  29 AUG 92 / Single-sex city day schools top the rankings
THE SINGLE-SEX city day school is now the typical top-notch private school,
according to the 1992 FT-500 survey of the independent education sector,
writes Andrew Adonis. Many of the top schools are former direct-grant
schools which were effectively part of the state system until the mid-1970s.
That is the key conclusion to be drawn from this year's A-level results in
the independent sector in England and Wales. Only one of the top 50 - The
King's School, Canterbury - is co-educational throughout. Nearly
three-quarters of the top 100 are predominantly day schools, and nine-tenths
are single-sex, though some are boys' schools with girls in the sixth form.
Westminster School, London, heads the list. Many leading public schools
performed better this year than last, yet famous names still languish far
below. Rugby, Haileybury, Repton, Clifton and Lancing are all ranked below
100.
The results are based on a survey by the Independent Schools Information
Service.
