  [Text] Guatemala City, 29 Jan (DPA) -- Guatemalan guerrilla 
leader Angel Garcia de la Cruz, 31, whose nom de guerre is 
"Lieutenant Ramiro," died during clashes between rebels and 
Guatemalan Government forces, military spokesman Major Edith 
Vargas reported today. 
  According to the Army, the deceased was one of the most 
important members of the "Javier Tambriz" rebel front from the 
Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms, one of the 
four rebel groups that comprise the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity. The "Javier Tambriz" front took its name 
from a guerrilla leader. 
  According to Marroquin, "Lieutenant Ramiro" was a lieutenant 
of "Gaspar Ilom," (Rodrigo Asturias), one of the four principle 
guerrilla leaders and son of Miguel Angel Asturias, recipient of 
the 1967 Nobel Prize for Literature. 
  The clashes between the guerrillas and the Army have 
intensified in the past weeks in the southwestern and 
northwestern part of the country.
