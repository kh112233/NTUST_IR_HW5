CANDIDATE WOULD BE 1ST LATINO ON COMPTON COUNCIL 
This city's first settler was a Latino -- Don Jose Dominguez, who in 1794 
received a land grant from the Spanish king. But after a century of cityhood 
and rapid Latino population growth during the last decade, Compton has yet to 
elect a Latino City Council member. 
It is a record that Latino leaders say they want to change starting this year 
as they rally around the candidacy of Martin D. Chavez, 29, a third-generation 
Compton resident who is running in Council District 3 against incumbent Robert 
L. Adams and six other candidates. 
"We have a good, viable candidate and he is very qualified," said Pedro Pallan, 
president of the Latino Chamber of Commerce and owner of the San Antonio Bakery 
on Rosecrans Avenue. 
Chavez, an affirmative action and equal opportunity employment analyst for the 
Los Angeles City Department of Water and Power, graduated from Cal State 
Dominguez Hill and also earned a master's degree there. 
Latino Community Unhappy 
Chavez's candidacy, though, is about more than competency and electing the 
first Latino council member. It is the most vocal message to date from the 
Latino community that it is unhappy with the black leadership that has 
dominated public affairs in Compton for about 20 years. 
"I think they believe that they are the advocates of civil rights," Chavez said 
of Compton's political leaders, "but in reality they are the keepers of their 
civil rights, not the civil rights of the minority community." 
Compton's political leaders, Chavez said, are trying to ignore the rapid growth 
of the Latino community and denying it an equal share of city services. 
Latinos, he said, are being treated "like an invisible minority and nobody pays 
attention to them." 
Compton politicians, according to Chavez and his backers, have not given 
Latinos enough public sector jobs, have ignored cries for more bilingual 
personnel in City Hall and the schools, and have failed to deliver needed 
improvements such as road repair and street lighting to the north side of the 
city, where much of the poorest Latino population is concentrated. 
City Manager James Goins acknowledged that the city has failed to hire as many 
Latinos or bilingual personnel as it should have. But he said Compton is trying 
to rectify that. 
"We definitely are concerned about it," he said, "because it's important to our 
future that we be an integrated city." 
Chavez said his main goal in running for office is to help the Latino and black 
communities avoid what he says will be an inevitable confrontation if black 
leaders do not begin sharing power with Latinos and heeding their demands for 
better services. 
'City Under Microscope' 
"This city is under a microscope right now," Chavez said. "It's small enough 
for people to study to get an idea of how black and brown people are going to 
get along." 
Latino leaders, though, are growing impatient and increasingly divided over how 
best to get the attention of decision-makers in the school district and in City 
Hall. Although they declined to speak publicly about it, Latino leaders 
privately acknowledge that some among their ranks advocate a more 
confrontational stance, such as filing discrimination lawsuits against the 
school district and the city. 
Other leaders favor a lower profile, urging that Latinos continue working 
through city and school administrative channels and make greater use of the 
ballot. Chavez places himself in the second category. 
"The real issue is voice. (Latinos) have no voice in the city," he said. "The 
city representatives don't represent them." 
Getting elected, though, is not going to be easy. Chavez and his backers 
acknowledge that in Compton, Latino power at the polls is weak. Latinos account 
for a third of the city's approximately 94,000 residents but only about 5% of 
the voters. Out of the city's 40,000 registered voters, only 1,800 are Latino, 
Chavez estimates. 
Councilman Adams said he believes many Latino residents are not voters because 
they are in this country illegally. That is one explanation, agreed Gregorio 
Sanchez, a Latino activist and member of Our Lady of Victory Catholic Church, a 
center of Latino life in Compton. But there are other explanations, too, 
Sanchez says. 
The non-voters "may be legal people who have never voted in their lives and 
they are scared," he said. "We have a lot of people here who have never become 
citizens and therefore their children (who are citizens) have never had the 
experience through their parents of the importance of the vote." 
Even if they increase their voter participation, Latinos still face the problem 
of convincing some Compton political leaders that they should share their 
power. 
"You got to remember Latinos were here before we were," said Councilman Maxcy 
D. Filer, who is black. "They were running faster than whites (fleeing the 
city) when I moved to Compton (in 1952). Now they just come back and say 'Give 
it to me.' " 
Bitter Memories 
Filer points out with some bitterness that Manual Correa, the only Latino 
member of the Compton Unified School District board, was on the city police 
force when blacks were trying to get jobs there, that Joe Ochoa, a Compton 
Latino leader, was on the city Personnel Board when blacks were fighting for 
government jobs, and that the late Ray Gonzales was a school board member when 
blacks were fighting to be hired as teachers. 
"I don't remember any of them fighting for blacks," Filer said. "Where were 
they when I was walking a picket line in Compton?" 
And Latinos, not blacks, Filer continued, are the ones getting hired at the 
industrial parks the city has developed at the south end of town along the 91 
Freeway. 
"Go out on the Artesia Freeway and see how many blacks are working out there," 
he said. 
Councilman Adams, Chavez's opponent, says that Latino residents lack influence 
at City Hall because they have not voiced their sentiments loudly enough and 
have not organized as a political force. 
"If you want something, the squeaky wheel gets the oil," Adams said. "I don't 
see a great percentage of them attending our council meetings." 
The Latino voice, though, is likely to get a lot louder given Compton's growing 
-- some say soaring -- Latino population. 
In 1980, the last year a federal census was done, there were 17,587 Latinos in 
Compton, making up 21.6% of the total population. The black population was 
59,530 or 73.2%. According to the National Planning Data Corp., a private 
research firm that updates federal census material, the Latino population in 
the city rose 65% between 1980 and 1988. 
The firm estimates that in 1988 the Latino population was 29,093 or 32.2%. By 
1993, the firm predicts, it will be 37,400 or 38.8%. 
Clearest Picture 
School enrollment figures paint the clearest picture of the city's changing 
racial makeup. The percentage of Latino enrollment is growing at such a fast 
rate, officials in the Compton Unified School District say, that it is expected 
to overtake the black majority within a year or two. 
Between 1984 and 1989, for example, the percentage of Latino enrollment rose 
from 30% of the student population to 47%. During the same period, according to 
ethnic census data that every school district must compile annually for the 
state, the percentage of black enrollment went down from 67% to 51%. 
Only 3.6% of the district's 1,385 teachers and administrators, however, are 
Latino, while almost 77% are black. In City Hall, Filer insists, the story is 
different. City administrators "are recruiting (Latinos) and they've done a 
tremendous job as far as recruiting goes." 
Latinos think otherwise. They point to city personnel records as evidence of 
what some call "systematic discrimination." Records show that only 50 -- about 
9.7% -- of the 514 full-time city jobs are held by Latinos. Blacks on the other 
hand, hold 401 -- or 78% -- of the jobs. 
Chavez credits the Police Department as being the only city branch that he 
believes has made a concerted effort to recruit and hire Latinos. According to 
the department's records, 18 of the 143 police officers are Latino. Of the 
city's 98 firefighters, seven are Latino. 
When Compton leaders debate the issue of Latino representation, the name of 
Assistant City Manager Edmundo Sotelo is frequently mentioned. City officials 
use Sotelo -- the highest-ranking Latino in city government -- to underscore 
their assertion that Latinos already hold important jobs. But Latino leaders 
counter that Sotelo is the exception: of the city's 38 top administrators, he 
is the lone Latino. 
'Not Very Aggressive' 
Gregorio Sanchez charges that neither the city nor the school district has very 
aggressive affirmative action programs for Latino recruiting and hiring. 
"I think we're not going to get our fair share until we get them to have an 
affirmative action plan. . . . They're beginning to cooperate but not as fully 
as they should," he said. 
Elisa L. Sanchez, deputy school superintendent (not related to Gregorio 
Sanchez), acknowledges that Compton's Latino community has been pressing the 
school district to adopt an affirmative action plan and step up recruiting of 
more Spanish-speaking teachers. 
"That certainly is a need in this district, as in many districts outside 
Compton," said the deputy superintendent, pointing out that there is a 
statewide shortage of Spanish-speaking teachers. 
Compton has only about 30 teachers who are credentialed as bilingual, though, 
it has about 7,500 Spanish-speaking students who are classified as having such 
limited skills in English that they must be taught in Spanish. That is a ratio 
of 250 to 1. In the same classification, Long Beach has 8,140 students and 71 
teachers with bilingual credentials, a ratio of 114.6 to one. 
There is a crying need, too, say Chavez and other Latino leaders, for bilingual 
personnel in various city departments. 
"Just recently, the police force hired two bilingual service representatives," 
Chavez said. "We were without any bilingual service representatives for over 
two years. Imagine how a Spanish-speaking person felt when he called in to 
report a crime and nobody knew what he was talking about," Chavez said. "There 
was nobody there to communicate with him." 
Norma Garcia, the city's personnel specialist in charge of affirmative action, 
says that a total of four bilingual dispatchers have recently been hired in the 
Police Department. 
Chavez has nothing but praise for what he says are City Manager Goins' efforts 
to bring bilingual personnel into City Hall. "He has recognized (the need) but 
he still has the resistance of individuals on the City Council and in City 
Hall," Chavez said. 
Goins meets regularly with a Latino task force that was set up last year after 
a group of Latino police officers charged that they and other Compton residents 
felt discriminated against. 
The biggest problem that Latinos face in trying to gain equal rights, Gregorio 
Sanchez said, comes back to the lack of elected Latino officials. "We've got 
like a barrier right there and we have to jump or go over that barrier." 
Strategically, chamber president Pallan said, chances are good that Chavez will 
make a strong showing because there are seven other candidates in the District 
3 contest and the vote is expected to be thinly spread among them. Pallan says 
Chavez supporters are already planning to set up a phone bank to help win votes 
for their candidate.
