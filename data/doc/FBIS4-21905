<F P=106> [Excerpt] Vellore, Feb. 6--The Tamil Nadu Congress </F>
Committee(I) president, Mr Vazhapadi K. Ramamurthi, said here 
today that he had 'reliable' information to the effect that the 
LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam] was printing fake Indian 
currency notes within Tamil Nadu and that it had restarted the 
manufacture of weapons within the State. 
  He told reporters that he had already passed on the 
information the Central Intelligence Agencies and to the Prime 
Minister. The LTTE, he said, was no longer interested in the 
creation of a separate homeland but was mainly concerned with 
amassing wealth. It was also helping Pakistan in terrorist 
activities. 
  Mr. Ramamurthi accused the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister, Ms. 
Jayalalitha, of having compromised with the LTTE. "She is not as 
effective now as she was in checking LTTE activities when she 
came to power. Twenty-seven LTTE cadre who had sneaked into 
Tamil Nadu through Tuticorin to sabotage the Republic Day 
celebrations in Madras were now at large. This information too 
had been passed on to the intelligence agencies. The police 
could not do anything to check or stop the LTTE activities." 
  He said the Chief Minister's 'compromise' was a valid ground 
for the Centre invoking Article 356 of the Constitution to 
dismiss her Government. [passage omitted]
