Two baseball memorabilia dealers said they are being questioned by Internal 
Revenue Service and FBI agents as part of a federal grand jury inquiry to 
determine whether Pete Rose evaded income taxes. 
Baseball's investigation into Rose concluded this year that Charles Sotto had 
arranged for more than $32,000 in payments to Rose for signing autographs at 
memorabilia shows. 
"The IRS did talk to me," Sotto told the Cincinnati Post. "They wanted to know 
how much business I had done with Pete." 
Chuck Perkins, a memorabilia dealer who lives in Florence, Ky., said the FBI 
wanted to see a $5,000 check he had given Rose for a baseball card show in 1987 
in Nashville, Tenn.
