  [Text] Ndjamena, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Chad President Idriss Deby 
told Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi that an international 
court decision over a contested stretch of desert was the start 
of a new era of relations between the two countries, Radio Chad 
said Thursday [10 February]. 
  In a message to al-Qadhdhafi, Deby said the decision to 
award 
the land to Chad was "not the victory of one party over another 
but the triumph of law." 
  Libya has made no official comment since the February 3 
decision of the International Court of Justice at The Hague to 
award Chad the disputed Aouzou strip, a 114,000 square kilometer 
(45,600 square mile) strip of desert. The court decision, which 
both countries agreed would be binding, was aimed at ending a 
22-year-old dispute over the area. 
  Deby said the decision marked "not only the end of a long 
dispute, but the start of a new era of trust and friendship 
between the Libyan and Chad peoples," the radio reported. 
  Deby's message for al-Qadhdhafi was given to a visting 
Libyan 
delegation Tuesday headed by Army Secretary General Abderamane 
Assaid [name and title as received], the radio added. Assaid 
also gave Deby a message from al-Qadhdhafi, the contents of 
which were not revealed. 
  Libya occupied Aouzou, the only town in the strip, in 1972, 
citing an unratified treaty between Italy, Libya's former 
colonial power, and France.
