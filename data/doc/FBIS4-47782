  [Excerpts] Nairobi, 3 May (KNA) -- His Excellency President 
Daniel arap Moi today sent a congratulatory message to Mr. 
Nelson Mandela for being elected president of South Africa and 
the victory of his African National Congress party in the 
just-concluded South African elections. [passage omitted]. 
  It was through your statesmanship, patience, valour and 
sacrifice that the entire population of South Africa has now a 
chance to lay a firm foundation to build a new nation based on 
equality and democracy. 
  Kenya has in the past supported your struggle and indeed 
looked forward to the dismantling of racial inequality in South 
Africa. Your excellency, Kenya is proud of your victory. We 
look forward to cooperating with the new South Africa for the 
mutual benefit of our two peoples. 
  Your excellency, once again, accept my heartfelt 
congratulations, as I wish the new South Africa peace and 
prosperity.
