ISRAELI RESERVE SOLDIER KILLED, 2 OFFICERS HURT 
An Israeli reserve soldier was shot to death today by a man who infiltrated 
from Jordan, and a Palestinian man stabbed two paramilitary border police 
officers in Jerusalem's old walled city, authorities said. 
The fatal wounding of reserve Staff Sgt. Pinchas Levy, 37, occurred about 2 
a.m. near Adam's Bridge, a crossing point north of the town of Jericho that 
links the occupied West Bank to Jordan. 
He was the second soldier slain in the area in a week. 
The policemen stabbed in Jerusalem were both slightly wounded, a police 
spokesman said. 
It was the latest in a series of stabbing attacks in Jerusalem since the Oct. 8 
Temple Mount shootings, in which police opened fire on Palestinian 
stone-throwers, killing 20 Arabs and wounding 140. 
Also today, Israel jailed without trial three senior Palestinian leaders in the 
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
The Defense Ministry said it ordered Radwan Abu Ayyash, head of the Arab 
Journalists Assn., and journalist Ziad Abu Zayyad jailed for six months for 
membership in the banned Palestine Liberation Organization. 
In addition, security sources said Dr. Ahmed al-Yaziji, an alleged PLO activist 
in Gaza, was ordered jailed without trial for a year under emergency defense 
regulations.
