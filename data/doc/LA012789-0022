THE WORLD 
Italian banker Roberto Calvi, found hanging under a bridge in London in 1982 
after his Banco Ambrosiano collapsed, did not commit suicide but was probably 
murdered, Italian judges have concluded. Calvi, dubbed "God's Banker" because 
of his close ties to the Vatican, disappeared a week before his death. At the 
time, he was awaiting the results of his appeal of a prison sentence for 
smuggling currency. The finding against suicide by a Milan civil court came as 
a result of an effort by Calvi's widow, Clara, to collect on a $3-million life 
insurance policy. A spokesman said the policy ruled out payment in case of 
suicide.
