  [Text] Dakar, 3 May (AFP) -- Senegalese President Abdou 
Diouf today expressed satisfaction with "the decisive step that 
the struggle against apartheid has taken" with the first 
nonracial elections in South Africa and the victory of the 
African National Congress led by Nelson Mandela. 
  In a communique issued at the end of the cabinet meeting 
today, President Abdou Diouf stressed "his full joy at seeing 
the decisive step that the struggle against apartheid has taken 
with the general elections that just took place democratically 
in South Africa." 
  Senegal and South Africa "opened representation bureaus" in 
Dakar and Pretoria on 26 January. "The two bureaus will soon be 
promoted to the rank of embassies, probably after the 
elections," the Senegalese Government said.
