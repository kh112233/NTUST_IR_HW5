TWO SEAMEN MISSING AS FREIGHTER SINKS 
Two seamen were missing after a Romanian freighter sank off Spain's northwest 
coast Sunday, Spanish rescue services said. 
A spokesman said the Tololovem went down after being smashed by high waves off 
Cape Finisterre. 
A rescue helicopter plucked 14 of the ship's 16 Romanian crewmen from a 
lifeboat. 
Among the survivors was the captain of the vessel.
