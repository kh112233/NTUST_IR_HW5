FT  23 JUN 94 / International Company News: Amgen shares hit by legal battle
over drug
The share price of Amgen, the biggest biotechnology company in the US, fell
5 per cent on Wall Street yesterday. The fall was triggered by concerns that
a legal battle between two smaller US biotech groups might lead to the
launch of a product to rival Epogen, the drug used to treat kidney failure
which last year accounted for about 40 per cent of Amgen's sales.
Investors sold Amgen shares, which ended down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 42
7/8 on the Nasdaq market yesterday, after Genetics Institute, a
Massachusetts-based company, filed a suit against Ortho Pharmaceutical.
It claimed its manufacture and sale of erythropoietin in the US infringed
Genetics' patent covering pharmaceutical compositions containing
erythropoietin. Ortho, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Amgen are the only
two companies in the US selling erythropoietin compounds.
Genetics, which is majority owned by American Home Products, said yesterday
it was filing the suit because it should be rewarded for the 'significant
patentable contribution' it made to the discovery and development of
erythropoietin, a protein which stimulates the growth and production of red
blood cells. Drugs containing the protein are used to treat kidney failure
and anaemias.
Wall Street is concerned that if Genetics wins the suit against Ortho, it
will be able to produce a rival erythropoietin compound that could steal
market share from Epogen.
The outlook for Epogen is crucial to Amgen, which is relying on rapid growth
in the product's sales to compensate for the slowdown in sales of Neupogen,
its successful cancer treatment drug which is used worldwide as an adjunct
to chemotherapy.
