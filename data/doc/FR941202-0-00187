 

The retroactive substitution of sick leave for annual leave will result in additional amounts of annual leave being
credited to an employee's current annual leave account. If the credit of annual leave to an employee's current annual
leave account occurs just prior to the end of a leave year, the employee may be at risk of exceeding the maximum annual
leave ceiling established by 5 U.S.C. 6304. Therefore, OPM encourages agencies to advise employees that any annual
leave in excess of the maximum annual leave carry-over ceiling that results from such an adjustment may be forfeited
under 5 U.S.C. 6304, unless the annual leave is subject to restoration under the conditions specified in 5 U.S.C. 6304(d).


Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rule Making and Delay in Effective Date


Section 629 of Public Law 103329 became effective on September 30, 1994. The authority to substitute sick leave
for all or any portion of any annual leave taken for purposes relating to the adoption of a child is retroactive to September
30, 1991. In order to give practical effect to this legislation, I find good cause exists to waive the general notice
of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Also, I find that good cause exists for making this rule
effective in less than thirty days. The delay in the effective date is being waived to give affected employees the benefit
of these new provisions at the earliest practical date.


E.O. 12866, Regulatory Review


This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866.


Regulatory Flexibility Act


I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they will affect only Federal employees and agencies.
