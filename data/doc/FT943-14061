FT  16 JUL 94 / Row grows over aid for Hualon
The government is coming under mounting pressure to reconsider its decision
to provide a Pounds 61m grant for the Hualon textile project in Belfast.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, Conservative MP for Macclesfield, is seeking a
meeting on the subject with Mr Tim Smith, the Northern Ireland minister.
Mr Winterton, chairman of the Manufacturing and Construction Industries
Alliance, an industry pressure group, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' by
replies from Mr Smith to a series of parliamentary questions.
He described the decision to earmark aid for the Pounds 157m project as 'one
of those great civil service blunders that have affected British industry
for several years'.
Mr Christopher Whitehouse, the alliance's chief executive, said: 'We want it
stopped.'
Mr Winterton's remarks came a week after it emerged that the recently
established Commons Northern Ireland committee is to probe aspects of the
project as part of its inquiry into employment creation in the province.
The plant - to be built by a Malaysian division of Hualon, a Taiwanese
conglomerate - will represent the largest industrial investment in Northern
Ireland since the failed De Lorean car venture.
It became the subject of controversy in May, when it emerged that the
European Commission overrode strong objections from its own officials in
approving the UK government grant.
In his answers Mr Smith said the government had no plans to review its
decision to assist the project, which it had concluded would not cause any
significant job displacement in the UK.
Sir David Alliance, chairman of Coats Viyella, Europe's largest textiles
company, has warned that 'as many as 1,000 jobs in Lancashire' could be lost
because of the project.
