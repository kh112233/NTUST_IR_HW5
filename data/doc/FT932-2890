FT  17 JUN 93 / Sparks fly as Lopez inflames Germans
THE VOLKSWAGEN fire brigade was out again yesterday, trying to douse another
brush fire sparked in Spain by the group's incendiary production director,
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
According to German press reports, Mr Lopez had described Germans as either
'square-heads' or 'concrete-heads' to an audience of more than 1,000 bankers
and business people in Madrid on Tuesday.
After a day's investigation and much dictionary-thumbing, VW officials
claimed to have divined that the Basque firebrand had referred in unscripted
remarks to German Hartnackigkeit, which means obstinacy or, more charitably,
persistence.
In terms which reportedly 'amazed' his audience, he said Germans had a
chance for future success only if they applied their methodical ways to
developing more creativity. Spanish people brimmed with creative flair. What
they lacked was the methodical German approach.
Mr Lopez, who left General Motors abruptly in March followed by a clutch of
his 'warrior' managers and legal actions alleging industrial espionage, also
claimed that in the next century there would be only three big carmakers in
Europe: one German, one Japanese and one Franco-Italian group.
The German survivor, Volkswagen, might take over its indigenous rivals in
the meantime.
The latest upset follows a series of events that could put Mr Lopez at odds
with his new employer. On Monday he contradicted clear statements from Mr
Ferdinand Piech, group chairman, on how the two men met.
Mr Piech said in a Financial Times interview he had been approached by Mr
Lopez shortly before Christmas. This was seen as an attempt to distance
himself from the controversy surrounding his new employee.
Mr Lopez said this week that they had been brought together by a components
supplier. This version was later confirmed by the group's chief spokesman.
