  [Text] The Defense Ministry's press service reports: 
  In compliance with the treaty on conventional armed forces 
in 
Europe, Ukraine continues to reduce its conventional armaments. 
Since the beginning of this year, four international inspection 
groups have already visited our state. They familiarized 
themselves with the practical implementation of the treaty 
provisions. They visited the Lvov, Nikolayev, Kiev, and 
Zhitomir armored vehicle repair plants. In the near future, 100 
tanks and 60 armored fighting vehicles will be liquidated at 
these enterprises.
