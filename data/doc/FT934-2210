FT  15 DEC 93 / Ofsted criticises curriculum tests
The national curriculum tests which were boycotted last summer by teachers'
unions in England and Wales were 'too burdensome for effective teaching',
government inspectors said yesterday.
Teachers' unions said the report vindicated their industrial action and
predicted that they would win enough concessions to call off their dispute.
The report by Ofsted, the education watchdog, confirmed union claims that
less than 5 per cent of state secondary schools took the tests last summer.
It added that there were 'significant failings' arising from the complex
structure of the tests, and that the tests in English for 14-year-olds,
which aroused strong and widespread opposition, were 'flawed'.
It recommended a cut in the range and number of assessments across the
curriculum.
The government stressed the report's few positive findings. Baroness Blatch,
education minister, said it 'provides further confirmation that the
assessment arrangements are raising educational standards'.
But she admitted that the curriculum had become too prescriptive and
difficult to manage, and said the government had already agreed to cut
testing and marking times for seven and 14-year-olds by 'roughly a half'.
The National Union of Teachers said government concessions needed to go
further. Mr Peter Smith, of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said:
'Ofsted are absolutely right. Educational standards cannot rise until the
bureaucracy is reduced.'
