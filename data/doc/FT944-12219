FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Tandem, Open Market in Internet
commerce pact
Tandem Computers of the US has reached a preliminary agreement to
collaborate with Open Market, a software company, in the emerging market for
electronic commerce on the Internet, a global computer information network.
Tandem sees electronic commerce as a significant new market opportunity.
Open Market, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has developed software that
enables companies to establish and manage on-line shopping services.
Electronic commerce is expected to substantially reduce the paperwork
involved in corporate purchasing - currently estimated at more than 2.7bn
pages daily. It also offers new ways to reach mass markets of consumers.
The Internet has more than 25m users and is estimated to be growing at a
rate of two to three million new users a month.
On-line shopping will generate about Dollars 4.8bn a year by 1998, Forrester
Research, a US market research firm, predicts. Growth will be driven by the
proliferation of home computers and by improvements in on-line product
presentation, it says.
Also boosting growth is the expanding use of commercial on-line computer
information and communications services such as Prodigy, America Online and
Compuserve.
