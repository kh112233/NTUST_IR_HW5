KEEPING MANSON BEHIND BARS; 
PROSECUTOR STEPHEN KAY STILL FIGHTS TO MAKE SURE THE EVIL OF THE TATE-LABIANCA 
MURDERS IS NEVER FORGOTTEN 
THE MOST superfluous traffic sign in California is the one on the short spur 
road that winds along the bay front to the state penitentiary at San Quentin. 
The sign says "NOT A THROUGH STREET." 
On a February morning of record-low 32-degree chill, Stephen Kay, a tall, 
deaconish Los Angeles County deputy district attorney, drives past the sign and 
parks at the road's windswept end. A body search completed, Kay is escorted to 
a prison conference room. He has a few minutes to arrange his papers for the 
latest in nearly 20 years of confrontations with Charles Milles Manson, 
mastermind of the peculiarly unforgettable mass murders that badly rattled 
California in August of 1969. 
The morning's legal conflict promises to be one-sided. Manson, led from his 
single cell in San Quentin's Security Housing Unit, has waived his right to an 
attorney. He is long past trying to ingratiate himself with the three-man Board 
of Prison Terms panel that will decide whether to grant him a future parole 
date. Now 54, his flying beard going to gray, the 5-foot-2 life-termer has the 
shrunken, unkempt appearance of a Death Valley hermit, which is precisely what 
he has said he would like to be if ever released. 
Manson reaches the door behind which the hearing officers and Kay wait with two 
"pool" reporters and two television cameras. The Tate-LaBianca killings are 
still news. New American Library late this year is publishing an updated 
edition of Ed Sanders' 1972 book, "The Family: The Story of Charles Manson's 
Dune Buggy Attack Battalion." The proceedings are being wired to a guardroom 
where 25 reporters and TV news technicians hover, hoping Charlie will say 
something suitably Mephistophelean. 
He often does. At the Vacaville facility in 1981, Manson warned Kay that he 
would be killed in the parking lot after the hearing. At Manson's 1986 
evaluation, Kay asked why Manson spends hours in his cell constructing 
scorpions out of thread from his socks. Manson, the razor-sliced swastika in 
his forehead emphasized in blue-black ink, took the bait. "From the world of 
darkness I did loose demons and devils in the power of scorpions to torment," 
he announced. That unremorseful response was good, Kay triumphantly thought, 
for another three-year parole denial. He was right. 
This year, a moment before he is to enter the hearing room, Manson abruptly 
decides that he is having none of this legally mandated but manifestly futile 
ritual. His wrists are being clamped into manacles in the normal procedure when 
he protests, "They'll think I'm dangerous!" He refuses the restraints and 
demands to return to his cell. 
With Manson in absentia for the third time in his nine hearings, Stephen Kay, a 
22-year veteran at the D.A.'s office, begins his 38th argument against parole 
for the five people convicted of murdering Sharon Tate and the six other 
victims. Kay has been making these arguments for 11 years, ever since Manson, 
Susan (Sadie Mae Glutz) Atkins, Charles (Tex) Watson, Patricia (Katie) 
Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten first became eligible for parole. 
"The Tate-LaBianca case had all the good things and bad things of the '60s," 
says Ed Sanders, the Woodstock, N.Y., poet and author. "It had sex and murder, 
life styles, counterculture, Hollywood, rock 'n' roll stars like Dennis Wilson 
-- everything that makes for a circus. The trial was a combination of 
fascination and revulsion, like a snake with its tail in its mouth. It just 
kept rolling along, this revulsive snake. It's still rolling along." 
SHARON TATE WAS 26, a classically beautiful but not quite top-rank movie 
actress eight and a half months pregnant, when a dark-clad band on a mission 
from Manson invaded the Benedict Canyon estate she and her film-director 
husband, Roman Polanski, were renting. The ensuing predawn horror of Aug. 9 was 
not without its complex of motives -- a fusion of the Beatles, the Bible and 
plain old resentment. A previous tenant there, Terry Melcher, the 
record-producer son of actress Doris Day, had snubbed Manson and his musical 
ambitions a year earlier. Sharon Tate and four visitors to the secluded hilltop 
were slaughtered, as Atkins told a grand jury, "to instill fear into the 
Establishment." 
The following night, after the sensational celebrity murders failed to trigger 
the black-white race war Manson had prophesied from his dark reading of 
Revelations and the Beatles' "Helter Skelter" during long group LSD sessions, 
Manson himself entered the Los Feliz home of Leno LaBianca, owner of a small 
supermarket chain. He tied up LaBianca and his wife, Rosemary, then left them 
to die at the hands of three demonic disciples, who carved away with knives and 
forks from the LaBianca kitchen. 
Prominent as some of the victims were, Manson immediately surpassed them in 
public interest. Kay recalls, "With his picture on the cover of Life magazine 
-- that stare -- Manson was like everybody's Freddy." Here was a man, 
prefiguring Jim Jones in the Guyana jungle, with the mysterious power to 
command others to kill for him, even to dispatch themselves to the gas chamber 
by taking all the blame at trial and attempting to exculpate the leader they 
sincerely regarded as both Jesus and the devil. 
Many mass- and serial-murder cases since then have involved greater numbers of 
deaths -- 24 in the case of Juan Corona, for example. What set the 
Tate-LaBianca murders apart and made them particularly frightening was that the 
killers included young women, mainly from peaceable middle-class backgrounds 
(Leslie Van Houten had been a Homecoming princess at Monrovia High School). 
"Better lock your doors and watch your own kids," Susan Atkins eerily warned 
the jury that convicted her. 
"That was the end of the '60s for a lot of people in L.A.," recalls Joan 
Didion, whose deal to write a book with star prosecution witness Linda Kasabian 
went awry. "It was a period when there seemed to be a lot of possibilities, 
good and bad. People were getting very nervous around that time. There was just 
a lot of stuff going on. Anything could happen. . . . I mean, it was 
everybody's nightmare." 
NOTORIOUS CASES may fade from the headlines, but they continue testing the 
legal system and its entanglements with politics for decades. Manson has 
effectively surrendered, but the others are fighting seriously for freedom, 
using skilled lawyers. For these convicts and Kay, all in middle age now, the 
combat over the evil of that distant summer has never really ended. 
Kay's side -- the mocked "straight" society perfectly embodied in Kay's 
conservative vested pinstripes and gold collar pin -- has won almost every 
time. The social rebellion of the '60s was carried to a horrible extreme in the 
depredations of Manson and his dropout "family" of acid habituees. The 
Tate-LaBianca carnage was, as Sanders says, "the death of hippie." Outraged 
middle-class values have reasserted themselves, quite literally with a 
vengeance, ever since. 
Juries in the nine-month 1970-71 trial of Manson and the three "Manson girls" 
and in Watson's separate trial asked for vengeance in condemning them to death 
for first-degree murder and conspiracy. In 1972, the California Supreme Court 
invalidated the existing capital punishment statute. By operation of law, the 
sentences were commuted to indeterminate terms ranging up to life. This has 
been the defendants' only victory. Since 1978, they have been eligible for 
parole. They remain in prison. 
The leading voice for unforgetting retribution has belonged to Stephen Kay, a 
nonsmoking, nondrinking, nonswearing Presbyterian church elder, youth soccer 
coach and father of three sports-minded suburban teen-agers. His role, largely 
self-appointed and not without criticism, has been to demand continuing 
punishment -- with little or no allowance for personal rehabilitation -- for 
those gunshots in the canyon, for the pagan smearing of PIGS and the illiterate 
HEALTER SKELTER on the walls of the wealthy in their own blood. 
If Kay continues to have his way, officials in a complex parole system that on 
occasion has been politically insensitive will think very carefully before 
letting any of the Tate-LaBianca murderers, however self-improved, out of jail. 
Kay says he handled "even more gruesome" murder cases in 14 years as a trial 
prosecutor, notably the 1980-81 trial of Lawrence Bittaker, who with a 
companion taped the prolonged torture of one of five teen-age girls they 
kidnaped. Kay considers Manson's murders worse, different in kind. 
"The reason I'm on the tail of all these people and I won't let up on them," 
Kay explains, "is that they wanted to destroy society in a race war and have 
hundreds of thousands of innocent people murdered. Sure, it was unrealistic, 
but they tried to have it happen." 
Kay mistrusts the parole machinery and wants to keep a public spotlight on its 
workings. "I can see that the system has not worked perfectly," Kay says, 
"because Sirhan Sirhan was given a parole date." The assassin of Robert F. 
Kennedy was told in 1975 that he would be freed in 1984; a public outcry forced 
a rescission of parole in 1982. Other unpopular parole approvals prompted the 
passage of Proposition 89 last November, allowing the governor to overrule the 
Board of Prison Terms and revoke a parole date. 
Of the eight Manson "family" members convicted in the nine murders that law 
enforcement was able to establish, only one, Steve (Clem Tufts) Grogan, has 
been paroled. Grogan, convicted in the killing of a cowboy named Donald 
(Shorty) Shea, has been quietly painting houses in the San Fernando Valley 
since 1985 after serving 13 years. He profited from showing the authorities 
where Shea's previously undiscovered remains were buried near the Spahn Ranch, 
Manson's dusty Chatsworth base. Kay had no part in the bartering. At the parole 
hearing, the board was influenced by a letter from Superior Judge Burton Katz, 
who had prosecuted the case and praised Grogan's later cooperation. 
AT SAN QUENTIN, a month before Manson is transferred to the new 
maximum-security Corcoran facility in the San Joaquin Valley, Kay's argument 
runs 27 minutes. He re-tells the old crimes in a painstaking detail that 
revives the months of widespread fear before the killers were identified 
through Atkins' euphoric blabbering to two Sybil Brand Institute cellmates. 
Atkins, Manson and 22 others coincidentally had been rounded up in mid-October 
at their Death Valley retreat and booked for unrelated arson and auto thefts. 
Atkins was placed in Sybil Brand as a suspect in the Malibu torture-murder of 
musician Gary Hinman a few days before the Tate-LaBianca slayings. "Wow, what a 
trip!" she blurted out to a fellow prisoner about tasting Sharon Tate's blood. 
After more investigation, Los Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis announced on Dec. 1 
that the case was solved. 
Kay's tone is subtly impatient, still unforgiving about the need to go through 
these statutory parole considerations. If, as some of his opponents suggest, 
Kay is simply seeking publicity, he would logically welcome these hearings. 
Instead, he was instrumental in lobbying for 1982 and 1983 legislation allowing 
the Board of Prison Terms to deny parole in multiple-murder cases on as much as 
a three-year basis, rather than hold annual appraisals. Tex Watson is arguing 
in federal appeals court that the loss of his annual evaluations is 
unconstitutionally ex post facto. If he prevails in a decision by Ninth Circuit 
justices expected later this year, all the defendants will get yearly 
consideration again. 
Kay tells the board that Manson has "a serious and severe personality 
disorder," although the prison psychologist's latest report maintained that 
Manson "is not psychotic and probably never was and never will be." After 
citing a string of prison disciplinary infractions to demonstrate the inmate's 
unfitness for freedom, Kay reaches his conclusion. 
"Mr. Manson remains locked in an Armageddon with society," he tells the somber 
commissioners, as if summing up to a jury hooked on TV courtroom drama. "It's a 
battle to the death. Society has a slim advantage now because we have Manson 
behind bars. Manson is probably the best advertisement that California ever had 
for the death penalty, because, frankly, as long as Mr. Manson is alive, he is 
a great danger." Minutes later, the board votes Manson another three-year 
denial. 
As Kay likes to point out in lectures around the state to explain why he keeps 
pushing when it seems implausible that Manson will ever be freed, Charlie does 
remain a role model of sorts to a fringe of satanists, neo-Nazis and skinheads, 
just as Adolf Hitler remains a hero for him. Manson gets a fair number of 
letters and gifts from young people who idolize him as the ultimate outsider. 
Heritage Entertainment, an independent movie production company, is trying to 
produce a not-unsympathetic movie based on his writings. 
Outside the prison gate during the hearing, two young San Francisco men in 
black paramilitary uniforms, accompanied by three women, carry signs supporting 
Manson. Afterward, they watch Kay commenting in satisfaction for the news 
microphones. They chant, "Stephen Kay, go back to L.A.!" 
KAY WASN'T always professionally identified with the case that Sanders expects 
will continue to horrify California "at least until the turn of the century." 
It was Vincent T. Bugliosi, the lead prosecutor, who got the glory surrounding 
the convictions. Bugliosi's 1974 book, "Helter Skelter," sold 6 million copies 
and spun off a highly rated 1976 CBS miniseries. 
Kay was a boyish 27, three years out of Berkeley's Boalt Hall Law School, when 
Bugliosi was keeping him and Donald Musich on short leashes as his muffled 
assistants in the long first trial, its singsong craziness one of the strangest 
courtroom spectacles grown from the '60s. Kay and Bugliosi were officially 
granted equal status at Watson's trial. Bugliosi left in 1972 to run 
unsuccessfully for district attorney and state attorney general, and to write 
more books. Kay chose a long-term career with the D.A.'s office. He is now paid 
$103,000 a year. 
A conservative Republican, Kay once appeared interested in a judicial 
appointment by Gov. Deukmejian. Now he is unwilling to accept the pay cut, and 
he retains much of his original idealism, as well. Uncomfortable with the 
notion of defending criminals, Kay remained a prosecutor. He recalls telling 
himself early on, "I'm going to be doing something that my kids can look up to 
me for." 
Of all the figures in the story, only Kay has stayed with the Manson case -- 
unless, with some irony, one counts his elected boss since 1984, District 
Attorney Ira Reiner. As a private lawyer, Reiner lobbied Manson for a place on 
the high-profile defense team. Reiner represented Van Houten for eight early 
months but proved too independent-minded for Manson, who persuaded Van Houten 
to fire him. 
Kay went on to prosecute Bruce Davis, an accomplice of Manson and Grogan, to a 
life sentence for the Shea murder. Then he handled Leslie Van Houten's 1976 
retrial, ordered because her lawyer, Ronald Hughes, had disappeared during the 
first trial. (Hughes' remains were found months later in a mountain wilderness, 
and despite a lack of proof, Bugliosi believes the "family" killed him.) 
At the second Van Houten trial, Kay suffered an embarrassing setback: a hung 
jury, teetering toward accepting defense arguments that Van Houten was 
victimized by a mass delusion the psychiatrists called folie a famille (family 
madness). Reinforced by Dino Fulgoni, the office expert on the since-outlawed 
"diminished capacity" defense, Kay recovered with a 1978 third-trial guilty 
verdict. 
All these years later, there is no love lost between Kay and Bugliosi. Kay's 
testimony bedeviled Bugliosi in inconclusive perjury proceedings against him 
arising from the mysterious leak of Atkins' lurid "celebrity death list" to 
reporter William Farr in some unnamed attorney's apparent violation of a 
judicial gag order; Farr spent 46 days in jail rather than reveal his source, 
which has never been disclosed (Farr died in 1987). Bugliosi misspelled Kay's 
first name "Steven" in "Helter Skelter," a slip Kay is still bitterly convinced 
was purposefully done "just to tweak me." Bugliosi's praise for Kay's 
continuing work is grudging. "He's accomplished something," the ex-prosecutor 
says. "That's his job. It's not an unusual job. It's visible because the case 
is so visible." But Tate-LaBianca fully belongs to Kay now. Always ready to 
make expert comments on the case, he sometimes borders on personalizing it in 
the way Inspector Javert personalized Jean Valjean's theft in "Les Miserables." 
When Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme aimed a pistol at President Ford in Sacramento in 
1975, Kay confidently told reporters that Manson had ordered the assault -- a 
theory never established. On Christmas Eve 1987, Fromme escaped from a federal 
prison in West Virginia. Notified within 90 minutes and fearing that Fromme was 
heading west specifically to kill him out of devotion to Manson, Kay got 
himself what he calls "added security" until the prattling little redheaded 
woman was caught near the prison two days later. 
SINCE AGREEING to leave his well-publicized "special trials" work in 1981, Kay 
has held a series of increasingly responsible administrative posts. For the 
past seven months he has been one of two assistant directors supervising 
personnel assignments and policy decisions for the department's branch offices 
in Van Nuys, Santa Monica, Torrance, Long Beach, Compton, Beverly Hills and 
Inglewood. He is not formally assigned to the parole hearings. With the tacit 
approval of higher-ups, he does it on his own. "It's nice to go in again," he 
acknowledges. "It reminds me that I miss being in court." 
He prepares for the sessions as if there were an imminent prospect of the 
concededly shattered Manson group reuniting for its predawn "creepy-crawl" 
missions. He collects damaging anecdotes about the defendants' conduct from 
prison guards and even other inmates. Lest new official faces be too young to 
remember the crimes, Kay maintains at his fingertips the facts about the deaths 
of Sharon Tate, Wojiciech (Voytek) Frykowski, Abigail Folger, Jay Sebring, 
Steven Parent and the LaBiancas, as well as Shorty Shea and Topanga musician 
Gary Hinman. 
Employing his practiced command of the details, Kay delights in contradicting 
the prisoners' sometimes self-serving latter-day accounts. In recent years, for 
example, Susan Atkins has taken to denying that she wielded a weapon. Kay goes 
back over the evidence showing that Atkins inflicted many of the 16 stab wounds 
in Tate's body, and stabbed Frykowski in the legs. The first hearing was 
Krenwinkel's in 1978. Kay says she blamed Watson and Atkins for the August 9 
Cielo Drive massacre, and she took umbrage when Kay testified that she had 
chased and struggled with Abigail Folger until Watson stabbed the victim, who 
was found with 28 wounds. "She swore at me, right in front of the board," he 
says. "Called me the F word and everything." 
In off hours, Kay would much rather boast of his 16-year-old son's soccer- team 
winning streak or his two younger daughters' test scores than bring up 
Tate-LaBianca. His reputation is anything but that of an obsessed, 
win-at-any-cost prosecutor. Kay's handling of a teen-age suspect named Michael 
Altenburger in the 25-fatality 1974 Stratford Apartments arson, one of the 
worst in the city's history, is still legend in the D.A.'s office. Three 
positive identifications and an initial confession supported the case against 
Altenburger, but Kay took it upon himself to spring the confused teen-ager from 
jail and drive him around the city on a six-hour reconstruction of his alibi 
that confirmed his innocence. Despite this storied fair-mindedness, Kay loses 
his compassion when asked about the Tate-LaBianca defendants. He cannot resist 
ridiculing them. 
"Susan looks the best," Kay says, smiling skeptically. "She comes all dolled up 
in her latest Bullock's fashions." He enjoys relating how the histrionic 
Atkins, who, like Watson, professes born-again Christianity, cried copiously 
before one hearing board, then left the room and snappishly berated a guard for 
not having her lunch ready. Watson, says Kay, is "like a used-car salesman." If 
Kay respects any of these convicts, it is Manson. "Manson's just himself," he 
says. "He has changed so little over the years. He's basically the same old 
Charlie." 
Kay is 46, but a squarely earnest moot-court manner and spare, 
distance-runner's physique combine for such a perennially youthful impression 
that some lawyers and supporters of the murderers patronizingly call him 
"Stevie." They mutter about excessive zeal in Kay's implacable volunteer 
crusade, even a desire for advancement in the rococo internal politics of the 
800-lawyer prosecutorial agency. 
Above all, Kay's critics cite the fact that Kay has changed his mind in 
currently making no exception for Leslie Van Houten. Parole has seemed a real 
possibility only for Van Houten. She remains, for some, the most appealing of 
the defendants. She was 19 at the time of the killings, came from a wholesome, 
church-going background and was present on only the second night; her direct 
involvement consisted of stabbing Rosemary LaBianca after Krenwinkel may 
already have killed the woman. "Why are they keeping the little Van Houten girl 
in jail?" demands Gary Fleischman, Linda Kasabian's former lawyer. "She's more 
than paid her debt to society." 
One deputy parole commissioner, Loretta Collier, agrees. "Personally, Leslie 
Van Houten, I believe, should get a parole date," she says. "I think she got 
caught up in being a flower child, allowed herself to be carried along by the 
rest of them." Leslie, to be sure, is burdened by something she said during her 
first trial. Asked if she was sorry for her acts, she replied metallically, 
"Sorry is only a five-letter word." 
Now 39 and by most accounts a model prisoner at the California Institution for 
Women at Frontera, where she obtained a college degree in psychology and 
literature, Van Houten has some dedicated advocates. They are the most ardent 
in casting suspicion on Kay's motives. 
"It's an attempt by him to grab the limelight," says Paul Fitzgerald, who 
represented Krenwinkel at trial and Van Houten at early parole hearings. "He's 
a loose cannon on a political ship in the D.A.'s office, and everybody's afraid 
to rein him in for fear he'll go over their head to the public." Van Houten's 
present lawyer, Dan Mrotek, thinks that Kay has a tendency to remind parole 
panels that there is a TV pool camera in Van Houten's hearing rooms, too. "He 
likes to play to the drama of the thing a little bit. It's the TV camera that 
makes the difference." 
Consistently underestimated by the Friends of Leslie support group, Kay has 
been trumping them in a long fight that he has smoothly escalated from the 
administrative arena of pine-paneled hearing rooms to the public forum of mass 
media appearances and nationwide petition drives. He has a sure sense of public 
relations and a willingness to employ it. 
Kay was momentarily shaken in 1982 when Friends of Leslie presented parole 
officials with 900 signatures urging Van Houten's release. Kay countered by 
enlisting Doris Tate, Sharon Tate's mother. With her husband, retired Army Col. 
Paul Tate, she lives only blocks down the street from the spotless view house 
Kay and his wife, Diane, a teacher, have owned since 1971 in an 
upper-middle-class neighborhood far from Kay's Criminal Courts Building office. 
Kay galvanized Mrs. Tate into collecting 352,000 signatures opposing parole for 
not only Van Houten but all of the Tate-LaBianca killers. 
The experience convinced Mrs. Tate to become active in a national group called 
Parents of Murdered Children. As a relative, taking advantage of the 1982 
"Victims' Bill of Rights," Mrs. Tate since has spoken effectively at parole 
hearings held for Atkins and Watson. 
"We know we precipitated Stevie Kay getting together with Mrs. Tate," Jerry 
Gumbleton, a Los Angeles Unified School District psychologist active in aiding 
Van Houten, says sadly. "It's hard to see how we facilitated or helped 
anything." Fitzgerald acknowledges, "It was Doris Tate who killed us." 
A release date was denied for Van Houten in 1982, then in 1985 (when one board 
member told her she was "closer than she might realize") and, again for the 
maximum three years, in 1987. "I'm ecstatic," Kay declared on that occasion. 
"If she gets out by the turn of the century, she'll be lucky." 
The board can deny a first-degree murderer a parole date simply by following 
Kay's lead and emphasizing the heinousness of the crime, a factor that can 
supersede a fairly rigid regulatory "matrix" of time served, good behavior and 
similar matters. "Based on the regulations as they exist," says Mrotek, 
"Leslie's term should be about 20 years. She has 19 in now. The crucial hearing 
will be the next one, in (July) 1990." 
In 1980, Kay publicly said he could envision parole for Van Houten when she 
turns 40 in August 1990. He now says that the proper time remains years off. 
"She has not shown the maturity that I thought she was going to show," he says. 
He mentions Van Houten's 1982 marriage to an ex-con named Bill Cywin, who soon 
afterward was caught in possession of a stolen uniform for a women's-prison 
guard. Leslie quickly divorced Cywin, but Kay was able to argue that the 
incident demonstrated a continuing tendency to "follow unstable males." 
Kay's monitoring has reached deep into the prisoners' daily lives to cause them 
trouble. Learning that Watson, who has married and fathered two children while 
incarcerated, was serving as assistant Protestant pastor at the California 
Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo -- with Bruce Davis as his own assistant -- Kay 
complained to the Department of Corrections that Watson was "building a 
personal power base." Watson is now fixing cars. 
In Sanders' opinion, Kay has his retributive rap down all too well. "He's so 
good at his re-creation of the murders," says Sanders, "that if a person became 
Mother Teresa and was in all respects a perfect person, that person would never 
be released from prison. I think it's important to allow for human change." 
CHARLES MANSON, born illegitimate in Cincinnati, was placed by an uncaring 
mother with a series of foster parents. By 1967, he had spent 19 of his 32 
years in penal institutions. On parole, Manson gravitated to San Francisco's 
pulsating Haight-Ashbury district. Through ready administration of LSD and a 
messianic message, he attracted a virtual harem of adoring women he called his 
"young loves," using offers of sex with them to draw males handy with guns and 
dune buggies. 
In contrast to Manson and his raggedy gang of 25 hard-core members and 60 
"associates," Stephen Kay has never experienced anything but mainstream 
stability. He came to California from Stamford, Conn., at age 2, the only child 
of Bud Kay, a television production executive, and Frances Kay, the now- 
retired society editor of The Daily News. (Kay wanted to write a book on the 
Bittaker trial with his mother, but unlike Bugliosi he dropped his book idea, 
claiming that publishers demanded too much gore.) 
Kay was 15 and attending Hollywood High when his mother and a friend of hers, 
the godmother of a 14-year-old San Diego girl named Sandra Good, squeezed the 
two kids together for a chaperoned lunch date at a Burbank pancake house. After 
30 minutes Stephen excused himself, considering this stockbroker's daughter "a 
stuck-up little snob." Twelve years later Sandy Good was wearing an X on her 
forehead and Kay was cross-examining her at the Manson trial -- during which, 
he says, she and Fromme cruised up on both sides of him and threatened "to do 
to your house what was done to Sharon Tate's house." 
Eighth in his class at Claremont Men's College, Kay finished in the top quarter 
at Boalt and signed on with the D.A. in 1967. Not originally assigned to the 
Manson trial, he read the start of Linda Kasabian's hair-raising 17 days of 
turncoat testimony when he was in a Northern California coffee shop on a 
vacation drive to Canada. Turning to Diane, he said, "Honey, I'm really glad I 
don't have anything to do with this can of worms." 
Then, District Attorney Evelle Younger kicked chief trial deputy Aaron Stovitz 
off the case for violating an order against news comments. Younger elevated 
Bugliosi to the lead chair and gave him two assistants. "Little did I know when 
I got back from vacation," says Kay, "that in 1989 I'd still be talking about 
this case." 
JOAN DIDION was appalled to hear the Beatles' "Piggies" over the p.a. system of 
a luxury New York department store a few months after Manson's arrest. 
Californians' images of the chilling case have been more enduring. "It captured 
everybody's imagination in our generation," says Krenwinkel's trial lawyer Paul 
Fitzgerald, now 51. "It remains vivid in the memories of everybody living in 
L.A. at the time -- people who were getting dogs and guns, terribly 
freakedout." 
Kay's old co-prosecutor, Donald Musich, who also remained a deputy D.A., shares 
Kay's worries that younger generations may be readier to parole the aging 
killers. "Average people do not believe there is the type of human being like 
Manson," says Musich. "As the years go by, they're not going to understand what 
went down with the acid rock of the '60s, when people traveled around by bus 
and lived with the dirt and group sex, and left a beautiful home and wealth." 
Some find it possible, in fact, to limit the significance of Tate-LaBianca to 
the tumultuous era of Woodstock and Altamont. "It was a type of case that I 
don't think we'll ever see again," says Musich, who thinks the "do your own 
thing" ethic went too far beyond the salutary civil disobedience of the time. 
"It was a culmination of social evils -- of the freedom and the attitude of the 
time of disrespect for society, of the laws, of law enforcement." 
Dr. Louis Jolyon West, director of the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute and an 
expert on cults and violence, largely blames a drug that is much less pervasive 
these days. "Of course," he says, "you can't close the book on the Manson 
phenomenon without saying something about LSD. We still don't understand its 
potency and its unpredictability." Manson, says West, "was one of many types of 
predators drawn to the essential defenselessness of these young and often 
idealistic people who were exceptionally vulnerable, anyway, and even more 
vulnerable because of their drug use." 
However, interpreting the Tate-LaBianca killings as a relic of their time is 
risky. Acid may have been replaced by crack, but cults go on. "It could happen 
again," West recognizes, defining the Manson group as a "totalist cult." The 
psychiatrist believes that the Symbionese Liberation Army was "perfectly 
capable of wiping out a houseful of people," and that society came close to 
recording another Jonestown at Rajneeshpuram, Oregon when the ashram community 
of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh collapsed in internecine intrigue. 
Manson's followers, says West, were enthralled by their leader's race-war 
delusions not only because of impairment by drugs but because of the group's 
twisted internal dynamics. And folie a famille, the clinically documented type 
of delusional thinking cited in Van Houten's trials, hardly disappeared with 
the '60s. 
Kay shares the view that a Tate-LaBianca atrocity could happen again, but his 
reasoning differs. Still disagreeing that Manson's soldiers were infected with 
a dose of slavish obedience by one dominant man's bizarre philosophizing, Kay 
blames neither society nor the '60s in relying on his old courtroom argument 
for a conspiracy of equally hate-filled renegades. 
"The Manson clan," says Kay, "was a group of misfits that just came together 
kind of at the wrong place and the wrong time. I think they were an aberration. 
You had hippie communes and peace marchers, but you never had the violence and 
lust for murder that were demonstrated by Manson and the family." By this 
reading, since bad sorts get together all the time, keeping the Tate-LaBianca 
killers in prison serves as not only retribution for old crimes but deterrence 
to modern sociopathic gangs. 
Stern current attitudes notwithstanding, it is possible that more liberal state 
administrations will free some of the killers one day. Bugliosi is convinced 
that 10 to 20 years from now, the three women are reasonably certain to win 
parole "only because they are in the state of California. If you were in 
Arkansas or Texas, the question wouldn't even be asked." 
Doris Tate, comforted that parole is less likely if Steve Kay stays active as 
her champion, supports his position that compassion for these no longer 
youthful prisoners is misplaced. "When Sharon was begging for her life," she 
asks, "what compassion did Watson and Susan Atkins give to her? Sharon, with 
her big heart, would probably say, 'Turn them loose.' But a society has to keep 
a stringent hold on the judiciary these days." 
Strictly speaking, it's the executive branch that Kay watches. The most 
thoughtful of his adversaries grant him understandable motives and professional 
respect. Allen Jan, Tex Watson's experienced lawyer, says, "Sometimes Mr. Kay 
comes across as if he were a hatchetman because of what he has to say. On the 
other hand, because of the horrible nature of these crimes, what else is there 
to say? Mr. Kay is not willing to let these people's memories die."
