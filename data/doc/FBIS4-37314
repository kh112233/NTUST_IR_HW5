His Majesty King Husayn will concentrate during the summit 
meeting he will have with U.S. President Bill Clinton next 
Wednesday on the peace process and its future in the Middle 
East, and recognition of the importance of the Jordanian role in 
this process. 
  In a statement today, he said his majesty will also discuss 
issues that contribute to enabling Jordan to carry out its role 
in the peace process in a manner that guarantees just and 
comprehensive peace on all fronts. 
  He said the Jordanian side has carried out several 
preparatory meetings with U.S. officials, and that it is clear 
that there is great recognition of Jordan's importance and its 
role in the region. He added that the Jordanian officials want 
His Majesty King Husayn's current visit to be of clear 
importance in terms of its results on the direct relations 
between the two countries, and on bolstering the peace process, 
especially since next month will witness the beginning of the 
Jordanian-Israeli technical meetings in the region on the 
demarcation of borders, water sharing of the Jordan and al- 
Yarmuk Rivers in accordance with the just shares of the parties, 
and the agreement on security measures. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that, in his news conference next 
Tuesday, 
His Majesty King Husayn will explain the latest developments in 
the peace process and the Jordanian position on this process, 
especially that progress on the Jordanian track is in the 
interest of the peace process on all tracks.
