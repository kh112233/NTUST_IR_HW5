WORLD; 
15-MONTH PAID MATERNITY LEAVE 
Parents can look forward to 15 months of paid maternity leave after the birth 
of a child, under Sweden's budget proposed today. 
The 1990-91 budget proposes extending parental leave -- with the state 
providing 90% of lost income -- from the present 12 months to 15 months 
starting in July of this year, to be taken by either mother or father, whether 
married or unmarried. 
The Social Democratic government plans to extend the leave to 18 months in 
1991. The family support proposal, at a cost of $2.46 billion the first year, 
is expected to be approved by Parliament.
