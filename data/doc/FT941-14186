FT  21 JAN 94 / Technology: Testing the purity of fruit juice - Worth
Watching
A technique developed at the University of Nantes, in France, to certify the
authenticity of French wine, is now being used to determine whether fruit
juices are as pure as their labels assert.
The Snif-NMR technique (site specific natural isotope fractionation by
nuclear magnetic resonance) determines whether sugars in the juice come from
fruit or sources such as sugar beet or cane.
Eurofins, the Nantes-based company which carries out the process, ferments
the sugar into alcohol. Magnetic resonance is then used to determine the
overall ratio of hydrogen and deuterium, the heavy hydrogen isotope, in the
alcohol. The ratio varies according to the type of sugar.
The process also identifies where the carbon atoms in the alcohol are sited,
a further indicator of the purity of the orange, apple, grapefruit or
pineapple juice. Eurofins: France, 40 59 45 71; UK, 0981 251602.
