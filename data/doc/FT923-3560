FT  11 SEP 92 / Glaxo profits rise 11% to Pounds 1.4bn
GLAXO, Europe's largest drugs group, reported pre-tax profits up 11 per cent
from Pounds 1.28bn to Pounds 1.42bn for the year to June 30. The results
were at the low end of expectations and the group's shares fell 7p to 746p.
Sales increased 21 per cent from Pounds 3.39bn to Pounds 4.09bn, while
trading profits increased 17 per cent from Pounds 1.104bn to Pounds 1.29bn.
However, Mr Ernest Mario, deputy chairman, admitted both figures had
benefited from currency changes. The US dollar had been Dollars 1.76 on
average during 1992 compared with Dollars 1.86 in 1991. At constant exchange
rates, the increases would have been 18 per cent and 12 per cent
respectively. Volume growth, excluding price increases and exchange rates,
grew 16 per cent.
Sales in all four of Glaxo's established therapeutic areas - anti-ulcerants,
respiratory, antibiotics and dermatological medicines - showed healthy
increases, said Sir Paul Girolami, chairman.
Margins fell from 32.4 per cent to 31.4 per cent as the company increased
its investment programmes. Sir Paul said the company had invested Pounds
595m on operating expenses for research and development during the year. A
further Pounds 300m had been spent on capital projects related to R&amp;D. The
group has set up an R&amp;D centre in Japan.
Sir Paul said such investment was the key to the future. During 1993, the
group would spend Pounds 700m on capital investments, of which 35 per cent
would be on R&amp;D projects and 45 per cent on manufacturing. Between 1993 and
1997, the group would spend about Pounds 2.5bn on capital projects.
Additional marketing costs had also squeezed margins. The company has added
500 representatives to its US salesforce.
Mr Stewart Adkins, pharmaceuticals analyst at Lehman Brothers, said higher
than expected research and development and capital expenditure would reduce
interest receivable in the future. In 1992 it fell 22 per cent from Pounds
179m to Pounds 140m.
Mr Mario refused to be drawn on when Serevent, an asthma drug, and Imigran,
a migraine treatment, would be licensed in the US, Japan and Germany, and on
negotiations with the French on Imigran.
Earnings per share rose 13 per cent from 30.4p to 34.3p. Earnings per ADR
increased only 7 per cent from Dollars 1.13 to Dollars 1.21 because of
currency changes. The board proposed a dividend of 17p for the year, an
increase of 21 per cent.
