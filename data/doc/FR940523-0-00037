Calgene provided evidence that APH(3
&rsquo;)II is rapidly inactivated by stomach acid, is degraded by digestive enzymes, and is not modified by glycosylation
(i.e., does not contain sugar molecules attached to the protein) when produced in the transgenic plants under consideration.
In addition, Calgene noted that enzymes such as APH(3
&rsquo;)II are heat labile. Thus, Calgene concluded that APH(3
&rsquo;)II does not possess any of the characteristics associated with allergenic proteins such as proteolytic
stability, glycosylation, or heat stability (Ref. 15). In April 1992, Calgene also conducted protein and DNA sequence
comparisons using sequences in four separate databases (GenBank, EMBL, PIR 29, and Swiss-Prot) and established
that APH(3
&rsquo;)II does not have significant homology to any proteins listed as food allergens or toxins in these databases.
FDA agrees with Calgene that the characteristics of APH(3
&rsquo;)II do not raise a safety concern. First, each whole food, on average, contains several thousands of different
proteins (Ref. 16). As a class, proteins are rarely toxic (Ref. 17) and APH(3
&rsquo;)II is not known to be toxic. Second, APH(3
&rsquo;)II is a phosphorylating enzyme, and all plants and animals that are part of the food supply contain such phosphorylating
enzymes without adverse consequences. Third, APH(3
&rsquo;)II has been shown to be rapidly degraded under simulated gastric conditions (Refs. 18 through 21). Finally,
the estimated dietary exposure to APH(3
&rsquo;)II is very low (480 &mu;g APH(3
&rsquo;)II per person per day,

 or 0.16 part per million in the diet, based on a 100-percent market share for tomatoes containing APH(3
&rsquo;)II (Ref. 18)).

Because oils produced from transgenic cottonseed and rapeseed would not contribute APH(3
&rsquo;)II to the human diet (see also section 2 below), the exposure estimate was derived exclusively for tomatoes.
The agency made several conservative assumptions in arriving at the probable per capita exposure to APH(3
&rsquo;)II of 480 &mu;g/person/day. For example, FDA assumed that all tomatoes contain APH(3
&rsquo;)II at a level of 0.1 percent of total protein although, of the two lines intended for commercialization by
Calgene, one contains less than 0.01 percent and the other less than 0.002 percent of APH(3
&rsquo;)II (as a percentage of total protein). Second, FDA included APH(3
&rsquo;)II in processed products in its estimate although high temperature treatment used in the production of processed
products would be expected to result in loss of enzymatic activity of APH(3
&rsquo;)II. In summary, the exposure estimate represents a theoretical maximum rather than a realistic estimate
of exposure to APH(3
&rsquo;)II.

Based upon the available evidence, the agency believes that this protein does not possess any properties that would
distinguish it toxicologically from other phosphorylating enzymes in the food supply. Further, because of the low
exposure levels and normal digestibility of APH(3
&rsquo;)II, the agency concludes that no limits other than good manufacturing practice are needed to ensure the safety
of the petitioned use of APH(3
&rsquo;)II (Ref. 20).

A recently published study (Ref. 22) also showed that APH(3
&rsquo;)II is rapidly degraded under simulated mammalian digestive conditions. In addition, in an acute mouse feeding
study, the investigations showed that feeding highly exaggerated doses of purified APH(3
&rsquo;)II caused no deleterious effects.

Relevant source of APH(3
&rsquo;)II. 

Calgene considered whether APH(3
&rsquo;)II could affect the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered aminoglycoside antibiotics. In doing
so, Calgene stated that only APH(3
&rsquo;)II from fresh tomatoes is relevant because it is the only form that is enzymatically active. Processed tomato
products (such as processed whole tomatoes, chili, juice, pulp, paste, catsup, and soup) are subjected to temperatures
in the range of 82 to 100 
&cir;C; these temperatures would be expected to inactivate the APH(3
&rsquo;)II enzyme. For edible oils extracted from cottonseed and rapeseed, high temperature treatment, solvent
extraction, and subsequent purification steps generally included in the processing of such oils would also be expected
to inactivate APH(3
&rsquo;)II.
FDA agrees that high temperature treatment denatures proteins and inactivates enzymes and therefore, processed
products that contain tomatoes with the 

kan



r

 gene are unlikely to contain any enzymatically active APH(3
&rsquo;)II. In addition, purified oils essentially do not contain protein; therefore, oils derived from transgenic
cottonseed and rapeseed modified using the 

kan



r

 gene would not be expected to contain active or inactive APH(3
&rsquo;)II (Refs. 18 and 23). Thus, FDA agrees that fresh tomatoes from plants developed using the 

kan



r

 gene are the only source of active APH(3
&rsquo;)II.
