  [Text] Bratislava, April 9 (CTK) -- Interior Minister 
Ladislav Pittner said he did not rule out that certain disputed 
stretches of the Czech-Slovak border would be resolved before 
the early elections. "I think we will be able to close the 
issue of the Sidonie and U Sabotu settlements and regulation of 
the Morava river," Pittner said after a government session today. 
  He stressed at the same time that he did not consider 
Kasarna, a settlement of Czech vacation cottage owners, a 
disputed place and would not cede it to the Czech Republic. 
  Pittner called "strange" the decision by Vladimir Meciar's 
cabinet, which approved only one part of the previous 
recommendations by ministers while rejecting the other. 
According to the ministerial recommendation, Sidonie had to be 
incorporated into the Czech Republic, while U Sabotu should 
remain with Slovakia, including territory provided as 
compensation for a change of border during the regulation of the 
Morava. However, Meciar's government refused to cede Sidonie. 
  "But the Czech Republic could not agree that a part of its 
territory would be acquired by Slovakia which would not provide 
anything in turn," he stated.
