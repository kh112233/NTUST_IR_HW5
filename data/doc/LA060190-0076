CALIFORNIA AS A TREND-SETTER AND OPPOSITION TO PROP. 111 
There should be minimal surprise if we wake up next Wednesday to find the 
ballot initiative raising the gasoline tax to pay for improved roads and 
highways has been soundly trashed. 
Gas prices at the pump have been creeping inexorably, relentlessly higher for 
many weeks. The increase averages 25% and is climbing -- in spite of a 
well-documented worldwide glut of crude oil and falling wholesale prices. 
It's business as usual: the defenseless driver flogged senseless by oil company 
greed. Could a voter be blamed for refusing to add even more pain by 
masochistically approving a gas tax hike?
