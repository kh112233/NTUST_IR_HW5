FT  22 JUN 94 / Test for currency mastermind
The German opposition Social Democratic party yesterday called for further
investigations into the irregular activities of Mr Alexander
Schalck-Golodkowski, the man who masterminded the import of the bulk of
foreign currency into the former East Germany.
The call comes after a 13 person parliamentary committee published the
results of a three-year 1.5m page report on the methods Mr
Schalck-Golodkowski used to obtain foreign currency, at least DM29bn,
(Pounds 11.6bn) to fill East Germany's government coffers until 1989.
Between 1966 and 1989 Mr Schalck-Golodkowski ran Kommerzielle Koordinierung,
better known as KoKo, a department of the East German foreign trade
ministry.
According to the parliamentary report, as part of its attempts to gather
foreign currency, KoKo spawned at least 160 companies worldwide through
which East Germany traded political prisoners, stolen art works and toxic
waste and stole embargoed technology. As head of KoKo Mr Schalck-Golodkowski
was one of the half-dozen most important people in former East Germany.
He appeared six times before the committee, but Mr Axel Wernitz, the SPD
deputy chairman of the committee, said he still had a 'series of ethical,
moral and political questions to answer.' A fresh probe was necessary, he
said, when the new parliament convenes in October.
Mr Schalck-Golodkowski left East Germany in December 1989, a month after the
collapse of the Berlin Wall, and now lives in a villa on the Tegernsee in
Bavaria, home to many other wealthy Germans.
There has been widespread speculation in the German press that no criminal
charges have been brought against him for fear of unearthing unwanted
information about connections Mr Schalck-Golodkowski had with hundreds of
leading German politicians.
These included the late Mr Franz Josef Strauss, the revered former Bavarian
state premier who arranged a DM1bn loan to East Germany in 1983.
