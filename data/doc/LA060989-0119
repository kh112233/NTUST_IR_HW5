PAINT FIRMS SUED OVER LEAD POISONING 
The city of New York, seeking to make paint manufacturers pay all costs of 
removing lead paint from city-owned buildings, Thursday charged in a civil suit 
that five leading makers and their trade association deliberately covered up 
damaging medical evidence about lead poisoning. 
New York's lawyers said it was the first such case in the country and was 
expected to spark similar lawsuits. 
The city asks for recovery of more than $50 million various city agencies have 
spent over the years in efforts to reduce the risks posed by lead paint, 
particularly to children. The city is demanding reimbursement for inspecting, 
testing, paint removal, treating lead poisoning victims and other costs. 
More than 6,500 incidents of lead poisoning in children have been reported in 
New York from 1983 to 1988. Lead poisoning can cause learning disabilities, 
mental retardation, behavioral disorders, permanent brain damage and even 
death. The greatest danger to youngsters comes from eating peeling or flaking 
lead paint chips. 
"At least as early as the mid-19th Century, the hazards of lead paint, 
including the hazards of lead paint to children, were well known to the medical 
and scientific communities, as well as to lead producers and painters," the 
suit charged. 
" . . . Notwithstanding defendants' extensive knowledge of the hazards of lead 
paint, particularly the hazards to children, and defendants' opposition to the 
use of lead paint on toys and children's furniture, defendants continued from 
the 1920s until at least the mid-1950s to advertise and/or promote lead paint 
as appropriate for uses which might foreseeably result in the exposure of young 
children to lead through inhalation, ingestion or absorption." 
Use of Lead Paint Banned 
Since 1960, New York has prohibited the use of lead paint in homes and 
apartment buildings. 
"For many years, these defendants or their predecessors hid the dangers of lead 
paint," charged Peter L. Zimroth, New York's corporation counsel. "They have 
caused great pain to thousands of victims." 
Mayor Edward I. Koch said, "If we have the right to demand that Exxon pay the 
price for cleaning up the environmental disaster it caused in Prince William 
Sound, we also have the right to demand that the lead pigment industry clean up 
the environmental catastrophe they have caused in buildings throughout our city 
and other urban areas." 
Named as defendants in the suit filed in New York state Supreme Court were NL 
Industries, Inc. of New Jersey, Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. of Ohio, Atlantic 
Richfield Co. of Delaware, Sherwin-Williams Co. of Ohio and the Glidden Co. of 
Delaware and its successor SCM Corp. Also named was the Lead Industries Assn., 
the industry's New York-based trade association. 
Efforts to reach the trade association late Thursday for comment were 
unsuccessful. 
The city is being assisted in its suit by Trial Lawyers for Public Justice, a 
Washington-based public interest law firm, and Thornton &amp; Early, a Boston 
law firm. Trial Lawyers for Public Justice and the Boston firm have filed 
lawsuits against the same defendants on behalf of children who allegedly 
suffered lead poisoning.
