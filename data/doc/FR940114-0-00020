 Final rule.





</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to expand the safe use of aromatic
petroleum hydrocarbon resin hydrogenated, as a component of wax polymer blend coatings for paper and paperboard
in contact with fatty foods. This action responds to a food additive petition filed by Arakawa Chemical Industries,
Ltd.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 17, 1992 (57 FR 9260), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2B4315) had been filed by Arakawa Chemical
Industries, Ltd., c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001. The petition proposed that 176.170


Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods

 (21 CFR 176.170) be amended to provide for the safe use of hydrogenated aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resin in coatings
on paper and paperboard in contact with fatty foods.


FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed expanded use of
the additive is safe. The agency further concludes that 176.170 should be amended as set forth below.
In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before February 14, 1994, file with
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

*****


Aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resin, hydrogenated (CAS Reg. No. 88526470), produced by the catalytic
polymerization of aromatic substituted olefins from low boiling distillates of cracked petroleum stocks with a
boiling point no greater than 220 




C (428 




F), and the subsequent catalytic reduction of the resulting aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resin. The resin meets
the following specifications: softening point 85 




C (185 




F) minimum, as determined by ASTM Method E 2867 (Reapproved 1982), ``Standard Test Method for Softening Point
by Ring-and-Ball Apparatus,'' and aniline point 70 




C (158 




F) minimum, as determined by ASTM Method D 61182, ``Standard Test Methods for Aniline Point and Mixed Aniline
Point of Petroleum Products and Hydrocarbon Solvents,'' which are incorporated by reference in accordance with
5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race
St., Philadelphia, PA 19103, or may be examined at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW.,
suite 700, Washington, DC

For use only as modifiers in wax polymer blend coatings for paper and paperboard at a level not to exceed 50 weight-percent
of the coating solids under conditions of use E, F, and G identified in Table 2 of paragraph (c) of this section.
