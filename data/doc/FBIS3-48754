  [Text] National Security Adviser Jose Almonte has proposed 
the creation of an economic growth area in the South China Sea 
as a confidence-building measure towards resolving territorial 
disputes over the oil-rich Spratly Islands. 
  Almonte's proposal came in the wake of Hanoi's move to 
reassert its claim over the disputed islands on the grounds that 
it was the first to discover them in the 17th century. 
  Speaking at a recent security conference among ASEAN think 
tanks, Almonte said "a multinational agreement to develop and 
exploit together the oil deposits in the Spratlys transcends the 
conflicting claims there." 
  The Spratlys is being contested by China, Taiwan, Vietnam 
and 
by the three members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) -- Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines. 
  "My own government believes there is no substitute for 
consultations that produce a consensus among the claimant 
countries," he said, warning that a conflict in the area "could 
be injurious to the entire Asia-Pacific community." 
  Almonte's proposal was similar to the "economic growth 
triangles" being established by ASEAN-member countries in the 
various sub-regions, like the East ASEAN growth among East 
Indonesia, East Malaysia, Brunei and Mindanao in the Philippines. 
  Almonte, who is also a retired army general, believed that 
such economic arrangements can help bridge political differences 
among neighboring countries as well as "make their bilateral 
problems irrelevant." 
  As an example, he cited efforts by Manila and Kuala Lumpur 
to 
use the East ASEAN growth area to foster closer bilateral 
political and economic relations despite their differences over 
Sabah and overlapping fishing grounds in the South China Sea.
