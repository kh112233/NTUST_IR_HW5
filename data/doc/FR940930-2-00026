 

k. Description of Project: The proposed project would consist of: (1) An upper reservoir with a surface area of 587
acres at a maximum pool elevation of 2,040 feet m.s.l. and a reservoir capacity of 23,000 acre-feet; (2) three new embankment
type dams, 110 feet, 50 feet, and 40 feet high, respectively, impounding the upper reservoir; (3) a new 180-foot-high
embankment dam impounding the lower reservoir; (4) a lower reservoir with a surface area of 390 acres at a maximum pool
elevation of 1,020 feet m.s.l. and a reservoir capacity of 23,000 acre-feet; (5) a 10,000-foot-long, 30-foot-diameter,
rock-concrete lined water conveyance tunnel; (6) a new powerhouse containing four generating units with a total
rated capacity of 1,000 MW; and, (7) a new one-mile-long transmission line. The applicant estimates the average annual
energy production to be 1,560 GWh and the cost of the work to be performed under the preliminary permit to be $2,500,000.
Limited core drilling will be carried out. 

l. Purpose of Project: The power produced would be sold to the Tennessee Valley Authority.

k. Description of Filing: Missisquoi Associates proposes to install a spillway gate at the dam, and construct a 175-foot-long
rock spur dike in the river to divert flows to the turbines. The spur dike will reduce the effective width of the river
channel from approximately 240 feet at the bridge to approximately 140 feet, and introduce a near 90-degree bend to
the flow pattern.
