SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5363), FDA published an ANPRM announcing the agency's intent to take several related actions
to reduce the amount of lead in food from the use of food and color additives and GRAS ingredients. The ANPRM requested
information on whether the specifications it is considering are feasible, and if they are not, why higher levels will
not endanger the public health, and what levels are feasible. Interested persons were given until May 5, 1994, to provide
comments and information in response to the ANPRM.


FDA has received a request to extend the comment period to permit at least an additional 90 days for public comment.
The request stated that additional time is needed to undertake testing, analysis, and data collection relating to
the ANPRM. The request also asked that the extension be granted as quickly as possible, so that the requester can determine
whether there will be adequate time to perform testing.
After careful consideration, the agency has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional time for
interested persons to submit comments and information relating to the ANPRM. Accordingly, FDA is extending the comment
period to August 3, 1994.
Interested persons may, on or before August 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this ANPRM. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
