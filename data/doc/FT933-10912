FT  31 JUL 93 / Group aims to cut level of skin cancer
BRITAIN has had its worst late-July weather for more than a decade,
according to official figures.
They will be welcomed by the National Radiological Protection Board, an
independent body, which yesterday launched a campaign to discourage
sunbathing.
The board is to publish weekly reports on solar ultra-violet radiation, the
part of the sun's rays that cause tanning and burning.
From next year the service will give daily forecasts so that the
sun-sensitive can take evasive action. The board recommends wearing
sunglasses, a broad-brimmed hat and 'clothing with a tight weave'.
Swimmers should use a sun block with a high sun protection factor. A
protection factor of 15 allows the wearer to stay in the sun 15 times longer
without burning than without any protection.
Without protection, it takes just 23 minutes on a clear summer's day for
sensitive skin to burn in the UK, the board said.
In the Caribbean it takes little more than half that. Sunburn increases the
risk of skin cancer, and Britons' carelessness could be behind a rising
incidence of the disease. Women are more at risk because they sunbathe more
than men, said the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. Pale skin and slow tanning
show a greater sensitivity, but more important is a family history of skin
cancer.
The government's Health of the Nation white paper last year said the
increasing trend of skin cancers should be halted by 2005. The Department of
Health has backed the board's initiative.
Government figures show incidences of skin cancer in England increased by a
quarter between 1980 and 1987, the most recent year for which statistics are
available.
Sufferers of the most common skin cancer need an operation to remove the
diseased area. Half of those who develop the more rare malignant melanoma
die from it. There were 1,091 recorded deaths from malignant melanoma in
1991 compared with 815 in 1981.
