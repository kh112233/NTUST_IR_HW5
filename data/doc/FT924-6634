FT  20 NOV 92 / Safety rules for VDU use attacked
HEALTH and safety regulations for visual display unit workers will cover
self-employed as well as directly employed workers from next January, the
government said yesterday, Catherine Milton writes.
But the regulations, implemented to comply with one of several EC health and
safety directives, mean employers face fewer obligations if they contract
work out to self-employed 'operators'. The Health and Safety Commission said
it had gone beyond the requirements of the directive in including the
self-employed.
In addition, the NCU communications union accused the government of
introducing dual safety standards.
It said: 'The regulations encourage two different standards of workstation
within one workplace - one for workers who use display screen equipment for
'a significant part of their normal work' and the other for the rest of us.
With no clear definition of who is or who is not a user in the eyes of the
law, there is every incentive for unscrupulous employers to operate to the
lowest standards they can get away with.'
The new regulations apply only to workers recognised in law as display
screen workers. The Health and Safety Commission said the new regulations
would improve rights for about 7m people.
The regulations are designed to combat the growing issue of injuries such as
repetitive strain injury.
The commission also produced guidance for regulations to introduce an EC
directive on manual handling that comes into force in January.
The regulations apply to all industries and services. The main new duties
placed on employers will be to avoid the need for manual handling operations
involving a risk of injury 'so far as is reasonably practicable'; to make an
assessment of the risk of injury in those operations that cannot be avoided;
and reduce the risk of injury to the 'lowest level reasonably practicable,
using the assessment as a basis for action'.
