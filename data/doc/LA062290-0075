VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK; 
ADULT LITERACY PROGRAM TO BEGIN 
Organizers of a countywide reading program will launch Moorpark's first adult 
literacy classes in late July at Moorpark High School on Casey Road. 
The Ventura County Library Services Agency's reading program for adults is 
looking for tutors, as well as adults who are interested in participating in 
the program, said Pat Flanigan, adult reading program coordinator for the 
agency. A training program has been set for July 14 at the Moorpark Community 
Center. 
The Moorpark City Council two months ago awarded the agency $8,000 in Community 
Development Block Grant funds to start a one-year class to help adults with 
reading problems.
