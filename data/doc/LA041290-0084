ENGINEER ACQUITTED OF FRAUD CHARGES 
A federal jury has acquitted a senior Cubic Corp. engineer of charges he 
falsified test results on mine detectors to be used by the Army. "It's been a 
long time. 
It's been a huge upheaval in my life," Dennis B. Fink, 41, said after the 
verdict. "It's virtually ruined my career." U.S. Atty. William Braniff said he 
was disappointed, but said the case sent a message that "defense contractors at 
all levels will be fully accountable if found to be involved in contract 
fraud." Fink, engineering project manager for Cubic's $7.3-million mine 
detector program, was charged in the 1988 indictment with participation in a 
massive fraud. Prosecutors alleged inferior workmanship and said that 
manipulation of test results on land-mine detectors was allegedly overlooked in 
order to achieve favorable results. Fink was acquitted on two fraud-related 
counts in August, but the jury deadlocked on 21 other charges. Another Cubic 
employee, William B. Bauder, also was acquitted.
