  [Text] Last May, the rate of inflation stood at 6.2 percent 
in Lithuania. Director-General of the Lithuanian government's 
Statistics Department Kestutis Zaborskas told INTERFAX that the 
rate of inflation, registered last May, was the highest this 
year. However, it was lower than some local economists and 
manufacturers predicted (20-30 percent). 
  Zaborskas believes that the main cause of the inflation jump 
was the introduction of the 18 percent VAT [value added tax] 
which replaced the 18 percent general excise levied on a 
narrower range of goods and services, and which did not apply to 
imports. 
  Alcoholic drinks and tobacco became 11.4 percent more 
expensive - the highest increase registered last May. Prices on 
food went up by 5.5 percent, clothes and footwear by 4.5 
percent, rent and electric energy by 7.1 percent, transportation 
and communication by 8.2 percent and other goods and services by 
8 percent. 
  In April, the rate of inflation stood at 1.6 percent. 
Zaborskas said that in June it will not exceed 3-4 percent. 
  In Latvia, the rate of inflation was 2.7 percent last April 
and in Estonia - 3.1 percent.
