FT  05 OCT 94 / UN maritime agency panel to review safety: A look at action
prompted by the Baltic ferry disaster
International moves to strengthen safety controls on roll-on roll-off
ferries gathered pace yesterday with the announcement by the International
Maritime Organisation of plans to establish a panel of safety experts to
recommend action.
The efforts by the IMO, an arm of the United Nations, follow the sinking in
the Baltic last Wednesday of the car ferry Estonia with the loss of more
than 900 lives.
The proposal by IMO's secretary general, Mr William O'Neil, is unprecedented
in the organisation's 35-year history and is intended to shorten its
frequently lengthy procedures. Even so, a final decision to go ahead with
the panel will not be taken until its safety committee meets in two months.
At the same time, the UK department of transport's marine safety agency said
it would ask its surveyors to carry out immediate checks on the bow doors of
all ro-ro passenger ferries operating out of UK ports. Mr Robin Bradley,
chief executive of the agency, described this move as 'precautionary' but
added: 'In the light of the evidence emerging from the Estonia, I believe it
is important we should take this additional safety measure.'
Checks of vessels' inner and outer bow doors will be carried out within the
next 28 days. Inspectors will also examine closing procedures, surveillance
equipment and indicators.
P&amp;O European Ferries, which operates 45 ferries, said it hoped these moves
would put an end to speculation and start to establish some facts about
ferry safety.
The IMO expert panel will be headed by Mr Giuliano Pattofatto, an Italian
naval architect and chairman of the organisation's safety committee. It will
consist of representatives of member governments and outside experts. It is
expected to begin its work after the next meeting of the IMO's safety
committee between December 5 and 9 and present its recommendations to the
next meeting of that committee in May 1995.
'The idea is to speed up the process of review instead of deferring it to a
sub-committee meeting in three months time,' Mr Roger Kohn, the IMO
spokesman said.
'Nothing will be excluded. You have got to prove to the travelling public
that you are looking at everything seriously and give reassurance.'
Like other IMO committees the expert panel will only be able to make
recommendations. But only a small number of countries operate ro-ro ferries
and since they will be represented on the panel they can be expected to
carry out its suggestions, Mr Kohn said. Most ro-ro ferries are in use in
Europe, Japan and Australasia.
The IMO has been criticised in the past by some of its more safety-conscious
member governments for the slow pace of its deliberations. The UK clashed
with other members over plans for a tightening up of ferry regulations in
the wake of the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in 1987 and last
year warned that countries would take unilateral action if the IMO did not
move more quickly.
IMO officials point out, however, that the 149-member organisation has to
work by achieving consensus. 'For some of our members the pace is unbearably
quick, for others we are very slow,' Mr Fernando Plaza, a senior safety
director said recently.
The IMO has created 30 conventions, which are mandatory on member
governments, as well as more than 700 codes, which are advisory, on a wide
range of maritime safety issues. But it depends on governments to ratify and
enforce its regulations.
In its early days amendments to conventions required ratification by
two-thirds of member governments before they took effect.
Many proposals took years to implement, so in the early 1970s this was
changed to make amendments effective unless one-third of members rejected
them.
At present member governments are given two years or more to consider
amendments but this is shortly to be reduced to 18 months.
The IMO is constrained by the need to balance the interests of developing
countries, where economic development often takes precedence over safety
considerations, and those of western nations where the public demands higher
safety standards.
'We produce the highest practicable standards, not the highest possible
ones,' said Mr Plaza.
The transport committee of the European parliament is to discuss ferry
safety when it meets next Monday.
