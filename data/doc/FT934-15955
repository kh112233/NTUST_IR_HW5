FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: CPC re-enters S African market
CPC International, one of the biggest US and international food
conglomerates, yesterday said it was re-entering the South African market
following last month's call by Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African
National Congress, for a lifting of remaining sanctions against the country.
The company has signed an agreement with Tongaat-Hulett, the diversified
South African group, licensing Tongaat-Hulett to make and market CPC brands
such as Mazola corn oil, Skippy peanut butter, Ambrosia desserts and
Mueller's pasta for the South African market.
Tongaat-Hulett will set up a company called Tongaat Consumer Foods to make
and sell the CPC brands. This company will export CPC brands such as Knorr
soups, Hellman's mayonnaise and Marmite spread to sub-Saharan Africa.
First-year sales of Dollars 260m are expected.
CPC pulled out of South Africa in 1987 on political grounds. Its decision to
re-enter the market comes a week after Pillsbury, a US subsidiary of
Britain's Grand Metropolitan group, said it was bringing its Jolly Green
Giant and Pillsbury Doughboy brands to the South African market through a
joint venture with a local company called Foodcorp.
Mr CR Shoemate, CPC's chairman and chief executive, said: 'Now that Mr
Mandela has called for a lifting of remaining sanctions, we are eager to
return to South Africa, which was a very good market for us.'
