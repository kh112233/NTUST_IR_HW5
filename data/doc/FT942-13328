FT  26 APR 94 / World Trade News: BMW to build Mexican car plant
BMW, the German carmaker, has announced its intention to build a Mexican car
plant and distribution network, making it the seventh foreign vehicle
producer in the country.
The Mexican government said the total investment would be about Dollars 600m
(Pounds 410.9m), although it appears this sum will include investment by car
parts suppliers brought to Mexico by BMW. The government said the plant
would be ready from the middle of next year, and would be based in the state
of Mexico, near Mexico City. It is expected to create about 1,600 jobs.
An official said BMW 'is not going to invest a lot in its own plant, since
it will be mainly assembling cars for the luxury market'. The move follows
an earlier BMW decision to build a car plant in South Carolina in the US.
Mr Eduardo Henkel, head of BMW Mexico, said the company would export
assembled cars from Mexico, principally to Central and South America. The
car producer is expected to buy parts from Mexico for its planned plant in
South Carolina, thereby circumventing current restrictions on the amount of
local content required for Mexican cars.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement Mexico has agreed to relax
requirements for a given Mexican content for vehicle parts, and to reduce
tariffs for US and Canadian parts.
The liberalisation of the car sector should eventually enable BMW to
integrate its US and Mexican operations. Mr Horst Teltschik, a BMW director,
said the company was attracted to Mexico by the economy's strength and by
opportunities offered by Nafta.
Mercedes-Benz recently began assembling luxury cars in the country. Mexico's
principal carmakers are Volkswagen, Nissan, and the US big three, Chrysler,
General Motors and Ford.
