The number of police officers killed on drug-related duty reached an all-time 
high in 1988, the Washington-based Crime Control Institute said. The group's 
study found that 14 officers died in drug raids and arrests and in serving 
warrants, including one who was assassinated in New York. It said such killings 
have averaged seven a year since 1972, when the FBI began analyzing on-duty 
police deaths, and the proportion attributable to drug-related crime was 18% in 
1988, up from 6% in 1985. Lawrence W. Sherman, the University of Maryland 
professor who heads the institute, said that stepped-up anti-drug efforts 
influenced the figures.
