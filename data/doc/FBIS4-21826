  [Text] Istanbul, March 27 (AFP) -- Three tourists were 
injured Sunday when a bomb exploded in the gardens of the Saint 
Sophia mosque [as received], the Anatolia agency said. 
  A German man and a Spanish woman were taken to a hospital, 
the agency said. The third tourist, who is Dutch, was treated 
for light injuries and discharged. 
  Investigators said the device, a fragmentation bomb, 
exploded 
at noon (0900 GMT) in the gardens of the historic mosque and 
museum. 
  It was the second time in four days that tourist attractions 
had been the target of attacks. On Thursday a bomb explosion 
injured four people, including two Romanian women, in the heart 
of the city's historic tourist district. [see previous Terrorism 
Report] 
  Although there was no immediate claim of responsibility for 
either attack, police suspect they were the work of the outlawed 
separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). 
  There was no clear indication that the bombing was linked to 
the PKK's earlier threat to disrupt Sunday's municipal elections. 
  The separatist group operates mainly in Turkey's 
southeastern, predominately Kurdish region. But last summer 
they announced that they would begin attacking cities and 
tourist sites in western Turkey. 
  Since that announcement, attacks on tourist sites have been 
rare, but several attacks have been perpetrated, notably in 
Antalya, on the southern Mediterranean coast, and in Istanbul. 
  The Saint Sophia mosque on the western side of Istanbul is a 
sixth century Byzantine church that was transformed into a 
mosque when Constantinople was taken over by the Turks in 1453. 
The site attracts thousands of tourists every month.
