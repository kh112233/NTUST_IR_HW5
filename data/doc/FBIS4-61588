  [Text] Pretoria 8 May TASS -- Leader of South Africa's 
African National Congress Nelson Mandela, who is to be sworn in 
as the country's newly-elected president on 10 May, received 
here on Sunday a Russian delegation headed by Vladimir Shumeyko, 
speaker of the Russian Parliament's Upper House. The delegation 
had arrived in South Africa to attend the inauguration ceremony. 
  During the friendly meeting, Shumeyko delivered to Mandela a 
personal message from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. In the 
message, the Russian leader congratulated South African people 
on the victory of democracy in their country and confirmed the 
invitation for the newly-elected South African president to 
visit Russia. 
  The head of the Russian delegation said he hoped to discuss 
the main aspects of the fledgling all-round cooperation between 
the two countries in a personal talk with Mandela. 
  In his turn, South Africa's newly-elected president stressed 
that he was inspired with Yeltsin's words and invitation to 
visit Russia, which he will try do in the near future. Mandela 
thanked Russian people for their support of South Africans in 
their struggle for democracy and expressed confidence in 
fruitful development of relations between the two states.
