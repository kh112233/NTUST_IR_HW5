  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said he was astonished 
at the remarks of Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili, and said 
the two issues Zvili mentioned -- a Palestinian state and the 
future of the Golan -- contradict the resolutions of the Labor 
Party convention and certainly do not reflect its positions. 
  This evening, Zvili denied having said that he is in favor 
of 
a Palestinian state. He nevertheless added that he foresees the 
emergence of a Palestinian state at the end of a long process, 
although this is a bad solution and Labor opposes it. Zvili 
added that he foresees Israel ultimately recognizing Syria's 
sovereignty over the Golan. Referring to an agreement with 
Jordan, he said that although it has been finalized he does not 
expect the Jordanian monarch to publicize it any time soon.
