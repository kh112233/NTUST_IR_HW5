FT  02 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: New vote 'would see hung House'
CALCULATIONS to be included in the Plant report on electoral reform suggest
that the supplementary vote system would have resulted in a hung parliament
after the April 1992 general election, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, first proposed the
system in 1989. In a later submission to the Plant committee he estimated
that the 1992 results would have left the Tories as the largest party but
with Labour able to form a government with the support of Liberal Democrats
and nationalists.
The number of Liberal Democrat MPs would have been between 44 and 48 -
compared with 20 at present.
Such calculations have to be treated with caution.
Under proportional representation, the behaviour of voters, as well as the
campaign tactics of the political parties, would undoubtedly change.
If a supplementary vote system was adopted, voters would indicate a first
and second preference.
If no candidate secured 50 per cent or more, the first and second placed
candidates then enter a run off with the votes for the eliminated candidates
distributed according to second preferences. Whoever then has the highest
tally wins.
At the last general election, about half of the current number of sitting
MPs won a straight majority of their constituencies' electors.
This is how the system could have affected some of those who did not:
LOSER? Mr John Patten,
Oxford West and Abingdon.
Result, April 1992:
Conservative 25,163
(45.4 per cent of vote)
Liberal Democrat 21,624 (39.0%)
Labour 7,652 (13.8%)
The Labour candidate would have been eliminated and his votes
re-allocated.
If, as would seem likely, enough put Liberal Democrats as second choice,
Mr Patten would have lost his seat.
SAFE? Mr Tristan Garel-Jones,
Watford.
Result, April 1992:
Conservateive 29,072
(48.8 per cent of vote)
Labour 18,482 (32.7%)
Liberal Democrat 10,231 (17.2%)
The Liberal Democrat would have been eliminated and his votes
re-allocated.
But unless almost all second preferences were Labour, Mr Garel-Jones
would probably have been safe.
UNSURE? Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
Edinburgh Pentlands.
Result, April 1992:
Conservative 18,128 (40.7%)
Labour 13,838 (31.3%)
Scottish National 6,882 (15.4%)
Liberal Democrat 5,597 (12.6%)
A four-way split allowed Mr Rifkind to win. Whether he would survive
under supplementary vote would depend on how many Scottish nationalists
and Liberal Democrats put Labour as second choice.
LOSER? Ms Glenda Jackson,
Hampstead and Highgate.
Result, April 1992:
Labour 19,193
(45.1 per cent of vote)
Conservative 17,753 (41.8%)
Liberal Democrat 4,765 (11.2%)
Ms Jackson could have lost to the Conservative candidate if enough
Liberal Democrat voters had indicated that the Tory candidate was their
second preference.
