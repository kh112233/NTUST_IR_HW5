 

(30) CFC12 and R502 Household Freezers, Retrofit. (a) HCFC22. HCFC22 is acceptable as
a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in retrofitted household 
freezers. See the discussion on HCFC22 under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114,
and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in retrofitted household
freezers. See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal chillers. 

(c) R401A and R401B. R401A and R401B, which consist of HCFC22, HFC152a,
and HCFC124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC12 and R502 in retrofitted household freezers.
See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12 and R502 industrial process
refrigeration. 

(31) CFC12 and R502 Household Freezers, New. (a) HCFC22. 
HCFC22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in new household 
freezers. See the discussion on HCFC22 under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114,
and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in new household
freezers. See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal chillers. 

(c) HFC152a. HFC152a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in new household
refrigerators. HFC152a does not contribute to ozone depletion. In addition, HFC152a's GWP and atmospheric
lifetime are significantly lower than those of most alternatives. Although HFC152a is flammable, a risk assessment
demonstrated it could be used safely in this end-use. 

(d) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to household freezers using
CFC12 or R502. See the discussion on the Stirling cycle under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113,
CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(32) CFC12 and R500 Residential Dehumidifiers, Retrofit. Please note that different temperature
regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. 

(a) HCFC22. HCFC22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in retrofitted residential dehumidifiers.
See the discussion on HCFC22 under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500
centrifugal chillers. 

(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in retrofitted residential dehumidifiers.
See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal chillers. 

(c) R401A and R401B. R401A and R401B, which consist of HCFC22, HFC152a,
and HCFC124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC12 and R502 in retrofitted residential dehumidifiers.
See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12 and R502 industrial process
refrigeration. 

(33) CFC12 and R500 Residential Dehumidifiers, New. Please note that different temperature regimes
may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. 

(a) HCFC22. HCFC22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in new residential dehumidifiers.
See the discussion on HCFC22 under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500
centrifugal chillers. 

(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in new residential dehumidifiers.
See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal chillers. 

(34) CFC12 Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, Retrofit. (a) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as
a substitute for CFC12 in retrofitted motor vehicle air conditioners. HFC134a does not contribute
to ozone depletion. HFC134a's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are close to those of other alternatives which
have been determined to be acceptable for this end-use. However, HFC134a's contribution to global warming
could be significant in leaky end-uses such as MVACS. EPA has determined that the use of HFC134a in these applications
is acceptable because industry continues to develop technology to limit emissions. In addition, the number of available
substitutes for use in MVACS is currently limited. HFC134a is not flammable and its toxicity is low. While 
HFC134a is compatible with most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment parts, it is not compatible
with the mineral oils currently used in such systems. An ester-based lubricant should be used rather than mineral
oils.
