Conquer Leprosy"] 
  [Excerpt] Kenya is well advanced in the World Health 
Organisation-initiated efforts to conquer leprosy by the year 
2000, researchers have learned. 
  Dr. Daniel Kibuga, head of the National Tuberculosis and 
Leprosy Control Programme (NLTP), says numbers of new cases 
registered yearly for treatment have dropped remarkably from 
10,000 to 700 patients between 1985 and 1992. A further drop to 
400 is expected in the next five years. 
  By Kibuga's prediction, Kenya may be among the first of some 
94 countries where four to six people in every 10,000 suffer 
from leprosy to come down to the WHO target of one in every 
10,000 by the year 2000. WHO considers the current rate 
"endemic." 
  In Kenya, leprosy is endemic in Western, Eastern and Coast 
provinces. Researchers say the disease is largely caused by 
overcrowding and poverty, a factor that makes it difficult to 
understand why it has not been reported in the North Eastern 
Province. 
  Isolated cases of leprosy have been recorded in Kenya's 
other 
provinces, Central, Rift Valley and Nairobi, says Kibuga, adding 
that the disease is caused by a bacteria clinically known as 
Mycobacteria lepraer. 
  According to Dr. Patrick Orega, the head of Alupe Leprosy 
and 
Skin Disease Research Centre of the Kenya Medical Research 
Institute (KEMRI), the last epidemiology survey conducted in 
Kenya in 1988 found four in every 10,000 people to be afflicted. 
  Of these 97 percent were recorded in Western and Nyanza 
provinces. Kenya, with some six million people suffering from 
leprosy, is one of the countries targeted in the global WHO 
strategy to combat the disease. 
  Alupe, on the edge of the Angoromo Shopping Centre, 500 kms 
west of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, maintained a record of 
4,000 patients on treatment countrywide, although Orege believes 
that there are 30,000 people suffering from leprosy in Kenya.
