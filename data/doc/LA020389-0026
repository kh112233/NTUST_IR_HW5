THE STATE; 
POLICE UNION SUES SAN JOSE 
The San Jose police officers' union has filed suit against the city, charging 
that inadequate staffing contributed to the shooting death of a police officer 
by a crazed gunman last month. "The situation probably would have been resolved 
if there had been two officers there," said Carm Grande, president of San Jose 
Police Officers' Assn. Officer Gene Simpson, 45, was killed Jan. 20 after he 
responded alone to a call that led to a confrontation with a mentally unstable 
suspect outside a downtown doughnut shop. After overpowering Simpson, the 
suspect used the officer's .357 Magnum service revolver to shoot him in the 
head.
