LOCAL; 
TRAIN DERAILS IN MT. WASHINGTON 
A freight train derailed today and one of the cars plowed into an apartment 
building, but no injuries were reported in the third Southern California train 
derailment in a month. 
Twelve cars of the freight train derailed just after 10 a.m. in the Mt. 
Washington neighborhood near the Pasadena Freeway, city Fire Department 
spokesman Pat Marek said. 
The cause of the derailment was unknown. 
"One of those freight cars did hit an apartment building," he said. "There were 
no injuries reported from that apartment building being hit." 
One of the cars also carried an unidentified hazardous material, but no leaks 
were found, Marek said. 
The derailment was the third in Southern California in the last month. Fourteen 
runaway railroad cars collided with a locomotive in Pico Rivera on Sept. 9, and 
about two weeks later, a boxcar loaded with Navy munitions jumped the tracks in 
Westminster. No one was injured in either derailment.
