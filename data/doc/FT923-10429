FT  30 JUL 92 / Observer: Prepared for the burst
'Keep taking the iodine tablets' is the Swiss government's advance
prescription for potential victims of disasters at Switzerland's five
nuclear power stations.
With a precautionary zeal befitting a country where all home-builders must
provide fall-out shelters for every resident, the 1.5m citizens living
within 20km of the plants are to be given rations of potassium iodide as a
safeguard against any outburst of radioactivity.
The chemical's protective value against thyroid cancers was shown by tests
after Chernobyl where, of 18m people treated with it, only three developed
an over-functioning thyroid gland.
The distribution has been meticulously planned, with zones of differing
urgency reflecting reflecting nearness to the plants. Since it is calculated
that beyond 20km away there will be at least 12 hours to take protective
action, supplies for residents at greater distances will be held in stores.
The cost is put at about Pounds 2m initially, plus annual charges - based on
five years shelf-life for the tablets - of Pounds 230,000. And naturally,
given Swiss logic, the bill will go largely to the potential
disaster-causers, the power stations.
