  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said there has been an improvement 
in the British media reports on Malaysia after the Malaysian 
Government banned new government contracts to British companies 
following adverse reports on the country. 
  We notice an improvement, particularly after the person 
(Andrew Neil, editor of THE SUNDAY TIMES) who started such 
reports, had been transferred, he said Sunday. 
  We will see whether his transfer will bring about a drastic 
difference in the (British media) reports, he told reporters at 
the airport after welcoming back Malaysia's badminton team which 
participated in the Thomas Cup tournament in Jakarta. Malaysia 
lost 0-3 to Indonesia. 
  Neil, 44, has been seconded to New York from next month to 
launch a current affairs programme of the Fox Television 
Network. He will be the executive editor of the new programme 
for seven months. 
  Replying to a question, Dr. Mahathir said the government 
would wait a while before deciding whether to offer contracts 
again to British firms because it wanted to ensure that the 
British media truly stopped its allegations against Malaysia.
