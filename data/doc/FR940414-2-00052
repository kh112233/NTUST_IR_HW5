<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive world-wide license to
practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Applications SN 07/401,141 and 07/892,485, both entitled ``A Method
for the Treatment of Dopaminergic Neurodegenerative Disorders'' to Phoenix: Regenerative Technologies, Inc.
of Peoria, Illinois. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America.


The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. This prospective exclusive license may be granted unless within 60 days from the date of this published
notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent
with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.
The patent applications disclose a novel surgical implantation method, which comprises implantation, into the
brain, of suitable histocompatible leukocytes activates by such agents as plant mitogens, lymphokines, and cytokines.
The claimed process offers an improved method of treating Parkinson's disease and other diseases that affect the
dopaminergic system. This therapy can reduce or totally eliminate LDopa therapy, which has significant toxic
side effects, and also presents an alternative to fetal implantation therapy. Use of the patient's own autologous
leukocytes is also convenient and reduces the chance of host rejection.
