FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Duties on fuels to be
extended - Hydrocarbons
This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which
were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and
Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his
publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill.
HYDROCARBON oil duties are to be extended to all fuel substitutes.
Previously only petrol substitutes and road fuel gases were subject to duty.
Customs and Excise said the intention was to apply duty to all substitutes
for oils used as motor fuel or heating fuel. Petrol substitutes and road
fuel gases are already charged with duty.
The principal commodities affected are orimulsion, a fuel oil substitute,
diesel fuel substitutes and some motor fuel additives. These will be charged
at the duty rate of the equivalent hydrocarbon oil.
A 10 per cent rise in rates of duty on hydrocarbon oils was announced.
Customs and Excise said the duty increases (including VAT) were equivalent
to: light oils (mainly leaded petrol), 3.3p a litre, 14.9p a gallon;
unleaded petrol 2.7p/12.5p; heavy oil used as road fuel (derv) 2.7p/12.2p;
gas oil (excluding VAT) 0.1p/0.6p; fuel oil (excluding VAT) 0.1p/0.5p.
A commitment was also announced to raise road fuel duties by, on average, at
least 3 per cent a year in real terms, as part of the strategy to return
carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000.
