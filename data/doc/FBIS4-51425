  [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- Taiwan will allow domestic 
and foreign beer and wine makers to set up production sites here 
as part of Taiwan's bid to enter the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Finance Ministry said Friday [27 
May]. 
  Standards for setting up plants will be the same for foreign 
and local manufacturers, a ministry official said. He added 
that the lifting of the ban on foreign alcohol production will 
be limited to low alcohol spirits and beer. Foreign companies 
will still be prohibited from producing hard liquors in Taiwan. 
  Famous alcohol manufacturers in Japan, Germany, and the 
Netherlands have expressed interest in setting up plants here, 
the official said. 
  This will be the first time in more than 40 years that 
Taiwan 
has opened its alcohol production to foreign countries. 
Currently, all domestic alcohol is produced exclusively by the 
provincial Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau, the official 
said. 
  A total of 1.24 billion bottles spirits were consumed across 
the island in fiscal 1993 with 95.35 percent produced locally 
and the remaining 4.65 percent imported, the bureau said.
