FT  15 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Video games
Dixons' executives must be slightly bemused by the Office of Fair Trading's
decision to refer the video games market to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. Last week the company issued a profits warning because games
discounting is rife and sales are poor. But while UK retailers may not now
be making money hand over fist in games hardware, software is still a nice
little earner. Since marginal production costs for software are low, there
is also a case for the manufacturers to answer over differential pricing
between the UK and the US. The restrictions on software licensing are also a
worrying sign, as is the fact that the Federal Trade Commission fined
Nintendo for price fixing in the US three years ago.
Differential pricing, however, occurs in areas as diverse as a trip to a
Disney theme park or the purchase of a CD. Multinational manufacturers'
margins are not normally broken down by regional market, so genuine returns
are difficult to assess. If companies are using US demand to fill their
factories and Europe to generate profit, it will be hard to prove and harder
still to change.
