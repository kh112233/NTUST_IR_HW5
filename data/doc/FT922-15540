FT  01 APR 92 / Li Peng under fire over economic growth policy
CHINESE legislators have expressed unusual criticism of Prime Minister Li
Peng's annual report, urging faster economic growth in keeping with senior
leader Deng Xiaoping's call for bold reforms, AP reports from Beijing.
Even though Li echoed Deng's call for bolder economic reforms, accounts in
the official media suggest many delegates at the annual session of the
National People's Congress believe the prime minister is not adequately
promoting the changes.
The official Xinhua News Agency yesterday quoted army delegate Wei Mingyi as
saying Li's proposed 6 per cent rate for economic growth in 1992 was too
low. China's growth rate for 1991 was 7 per cent. 'This does not accord with
the spirit of speeding up economic development,' Xinhua paraphrased Wei as
saying.
Another delegate said many local enterprises lost key decision-making powers
after the central government imposed anti-inflation measures in 1988. Others
criticised the government for failing to streamline the bureaucracy.
Xinhua also reported on several delegates opposing the plan to build the
world's largest hydroelectric project, at the Three Gorges on the Yangtze
River. Li has been a main backer of the dam.
A senior Chinese official acknowledged yesterday that Beijing is collecting
information on Hong Kong residents, but denied they would be arrested after
China takes control of the territory in 1997.
Tao Siju, China's minister of public security, told the government-owned
Hong Kong radio that Beijing keeps files on scores of Hong Kong residents.
Many of them are believed to be pro-democracy activists.
