  [Text] Taipei, Dec 28 (AFP)--[passage omitted] Another 
attempt to hijack a Chinese airliner to Taiwan failed only hours 
earlier when a hijacker was overpowered, the state-funded 
Broadcasting Corporation of China reported, citing Taipei 
airport sources. [passage omitted] 
  The hijacker's bomb turned out to be a vitamin can with 
three 
batteries, one nail and a matchbox inside, and wired with thin 
cable, said a government official. 
  The couple told police they had been forced to seek asylum 
after the Chinese communists demolished their house four months 
ago. 
  A government statement said Luo, holding the fake bomb in 
one 
hand, threatened the pilot while his wife showed a card on which 
was written "Go to Taiwan, or we will blow up the plane" to 
stewardess Zhang Wei. Pilot Zhen Shanming said he did not have 
enough fuel to fly to Taiwan, but agreed to do so after the 
hijacker threatened to detonate the device, the government 
statement said. 
  The earlier attempted hijacking reported by the Broadcasting 
Corporation of China occurred near the neutral line separating 
airspace between China and Taiwan. [passage omitted] 
  Tuesday's hijacking came only a day after China vowed to 
beef 
up security at its airports, which western experts consider to 
be lamentably poor. 
  Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of 
China 
(CAAC), Jiang Zhuping, said China would invest 200 million yuan 
($35 million) next year to build a series of safety facilities, 
including "defensive stockades surrounding airports and 
equipment for safety examinations and fire prevention." 
  Flight crew members will be "instructed to take action 
against hijackers," the report said, but only "on the supreme 
principle of ensuring the absolute safety of passengers and the 
planes," Jiang, quoted by the Xinhua news agency, said.
