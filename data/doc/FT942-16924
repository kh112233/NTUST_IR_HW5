FT  07 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: E Europe investment patterns
spelt out
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Russia are the most attractive of
the eastern and central European markets for long-term investment and
expansion, according to a survey of international investors and professional
advisers published yesterday.
But Slovakia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Estonia and Romania are seen as
'tomorrow's stars for regional development', according to Central &amp; Eastern
European Investment: 1994 Research Report, which compiled its report from
questionnaires completed by 213 international organisations.
Joint ventures remain the most common corporate investment vehicle, with
comparatively little acquisition or greenfield investment in the region. But
survey participants point to several problem areas.
'The lack of any secure, workable banking infrastructure was cited as a
major drawback to investment,' the report says. In addition, the lack of
reliable auditing services locally deters investors from making local
acquisitions, while 'the pervasive command economy mentality' poses
difficulties for those involved in advising on privatisations.
