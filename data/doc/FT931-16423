FT  07 JAN 93 / Menem reiterates Falklands claim
WITHIN minutes of British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's arrival in
Argentina yesterday President Carlos Menem reiterated strongly his country's
claim to the disputed Falkland Islands.
Mr Menem said on TV that 'before the year 2000, Argentina' would be 'setting
foot on the Falklands, without any type of conflict.'
Mr Hurd, who is to meet Mr Menem today, repeated at Buenos Aires airport
Britain's refusal to discuss sovereignty of the Falklands, over which the UK
fought a 1982 war. 'We have no doubt of our position, so what we have to do
is build on progress already made.'
Mr Hurd said his visit will further consolidate relations with Argentina,
with which Britain resumed diplomatic links three years ago. The two have
reached temporary fishing agreements in the South Atlantic and on military
confidence-building measures.
One of Argentina's most cherished foreign policy objectives is to assume a
more prominent role in international affairs. Mr Menem and Mr Guido di
Tella, foreign minister, will hope Mr Hurd can help them advance this goal.
However, frequent reiterations of Argentina's claim to the islands has not
advanced Mr Menem's aim to make an official visit to the UK.
