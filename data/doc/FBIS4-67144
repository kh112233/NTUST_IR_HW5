  [Text] ANF -- At an international antinarcotics conference 
that has been under way in Quito, Ecuador, since last week, 
Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz said that the Colombian 
cartels, and mainly the Cali cartel, are establishing themselves 
in Bolivia to produce cocaine on a large scale. 
  "We could be facing the imminent and increasing transfer of 
foreign criminal drug organizations to Bolivia," said Soliz, in 
a speech before the 12th International Drug Enforcement 
Conference (IDEC). 
  He said that the drug trafficking organizations, and 
especially those from Colombia, are able to subjugate the most 
important indigenous organizations in gaining control over the 
entire drug circuit, from producing coca to cocaine paste, 
refined cocaine, and the export and marketing of pure cocaine. 
  He added: "The Colombian drug rings hope to establish their 
own supply system for the chemicals they need, as it is known 
that they want to complete the circuit by refining their own 
production." 
  Soliz said that to estimate the presence of illegal 
chemicals 
in Bolivian territory "is a frightening exercise, as the huge 
border regions shared with our neighbors are the natural habitat 
for unique species of animals and plants, with rivers full of an 
impressive variety of fish, and with fertile land suitable for 
all manner of cultivation." 
  Soliz added: "This entire habitat where ancient ethnic 
groups live, forming a natural ecosystem, alive and without 
contamination, is now in danger due to the voracity of drug 
traffickers and their suppliers of chemicals."
