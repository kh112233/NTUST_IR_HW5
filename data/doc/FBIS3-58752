  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN)--The Federal Intelligence Service 
(BND) has denied reports from the ARD (German television) 
magazine program "Monitor" alleging that the BND is about to 
extend its activities to industrial espionage ("Competitive 
Intelligence") [previous two words in English] to the benefit of 
German industry. 
  "We have no mandate for this," BND spokesman Elmar Lehberg 
said on Friday [21 January] in response to a question, but he 
would not comment on the detailed information from the 
television program. In keeping with the BND law, the BND only 
gathers information about foreign countries that are of foreign 
and security policy importance for Germany, said Lehberg. 
  The "Monitor" program showed documents on Thursday allegedly 
proving that the BND had, without the knowledge of the 
parliamentary control commission, developed plans to restructure 
Department 1 and to commission it with spying on foreign 
businesses. The report, which was classified as secret, names 
German industry as the "consumer" [Bedarfstraeger]. Bernd 
Schmidbauer, state secretary in the Federal Chancellery, said he 
had no knowledge of such plans.
