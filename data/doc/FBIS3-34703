  [Text] Labor's Secretary General Nisim Zvili says that a 
Palestinian state will emerge in the territories at the end of 
the peace process and the Golan Heights will be returned to 
Syria. Zvili adds that Israel has a framework agreement signed 
with King Husayn, and when it is publicized, people will find 
the security arrangements achieved for the border crossings 
surprising. Nisim Zvili spoke before Hashomer Hatza'ir [youth 
movement affiliated with MAPAM, the United Workers Party, a 
Meretz component] council at Ma'ale Habesor in the western Negev 
yesterday. 
  Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that Hashomer 
Hatza'ir leaders decided to convene their council near the Gaza 
Strip border in order to emphasize the main topic of their 
discussion: a call on the Palestinian youth to establish a 
peace camp and to struggle against the extremists.
