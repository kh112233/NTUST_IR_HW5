  [Text] Although authorities have not ruled out that the 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board could have exploded a car bomb [on 
22 May] that killed six men in uniform and injured nine other 
people, the strongest theory is that this was a strike by the 
terrorist wing of the Medellin Cartel. 
  An official report states that after it was announced that 
Germany's Eintracht soccer team would play at the Atanasio 
Girardot Stadium intelligence organizations traced several 
telephone threats against this team, because the government of 
that country refused to grant asylum to the family of the late 
capo Pablo Escobar Gaviria 
  [Begin National Police Director General Octavio Vargas Silva

are analyzing this and other information at our disposal and we 
will, in due time, issue a complete report on what really 
happened. [end recording] 
  The police in Antioquia Department were placed on maximum 
alert following the terrorist attack.
