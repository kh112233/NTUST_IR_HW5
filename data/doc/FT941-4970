FT  09 MAR 94 / Employers face Pounds 55m maternity pay bill
The additional Pounds 55m a year cost of improved maternity payments, which
will benefit about 285,000 working women, will be met by employers, the
government said yesterday.
The announcement follows a government consultation which set out options for
adapting UK maternity benefits to meet European Union directive
requirements.
The new system, which must be in place by October 16, simplifies current
benefits which give different rates of maternity pay depending on whether a
women has worked 26 weeks, two years or five years in the same job.
In future, any woman who has been employed in the same job for 26 weeks or
more will be entitled to statutory maternity pay. This will be 90 per cent
of earnings for all recipients for the first six weeks and Pounds 52.50 for
the remaining 12 weeks.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said in a Commons written reply
that the additional cost would be covered by reducing employers'
reimbursements for statutory maternity pay to 92 per cent from September 4
this year.
Small employers would continue to be fully reimbursed.
'As a whole employers will not be out of pocket,' said Mr Lilley. This was
because the reduction in employers' National Insurance contributions
announced in the Budget would more than compensate them.
