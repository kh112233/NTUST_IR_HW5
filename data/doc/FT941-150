FT  31 MAR 94 / Arms For Iraq - The Scott Inquiry: Passing the buck
Where will the buck stop? Over the summer Lord Justice Scott and Presiley
Baxendale QC will consider the roles of Matrix Churchill prosecutor Alan
Moses QC, who claimed he was not shown key intelligence papers. Ministers
Alan Clark and William Waldegrave relaxed guidelines for defence exports but
Alan Clark later described his colleagues' explanations as 'Alice in
Wonderland'. Prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major both denied
all knowledge of the affair. Michael Heseltine was reluctant to sign a
certificate to suppress official documents but was overruled by Sir Nicholas
Lyell, who later insisted he was as steady as a lighthouse. Paul Henderson,
former Matrix Churchill managing director and MI6 spy, was one of three
businessmen pursued by Customs and caught in the Whitehall web of civil
servants and intelligence agents.
