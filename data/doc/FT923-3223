FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (12): Expanding tourism presents
dilemmas - Paradise has problems
GOLDEN sunlight dances off the clear turquoise water of the Indian ocean. A
gentle breeze, blowing across the lagoon, rustles the deep green leaves of
palm trees fringing white sandy beaches. Half a mile out to sea, the surf
breaks gently over the coral reef.
There are few 'sea, sun and sand' tourist destinations in the world which
come as close to paradise as Mauritius, with its excellent facilities for
deep sea diving, big game fishing, water skiing, wind surfing, riding and
sailing.
But the tourism sector is struggling to come to terms with a rocketing
expansion of the industry. This has created serious environmental and
economic problems and left government confused about the policy direction it
should follow for the next five years.
Industry experts say a comprehensive government five-year tourism
development policy is eagerly awaited. They look to this to give clear
directions about critical policy issues such as tourist arrivals, hotel
development, international marketing strategies, environmental impact
assessments, and plans to develop a more diversified and high quality
product.
The tourism boom in Mauritius has been impressive. Tourist arrivals have
doubled in six years: 148,900 in 1985 to 298,500 last year. Earnings have
risen from MR845m to M3.9bn over the same period, making tourism the third
biggest foreign exchange winner. Particularly good results have been
achieved in boosting the average spending per tourist, which increased from
MR5,676 in 1985 to M13,000 in 1991.
After a disappointing year in 1991, during which tourist arrivals increased
only by 2.4 per cent over the previous year ( mainly because of world
recession and the Gulf War), Mr Noel Lee Cheong Lem, minister of tourism,
says arrivals look likely to return to a growth rate of about 10 per cent
this year.
This pattern of growth has had its costs. The number of hotels in the past
six years has increased from 55 to 80, with an increase in the number of
beds from 5,387 to 10,482. Bed occupancy rates fell to a record low of only
47 per cent last year, as the increase in tourists has not kept pace with
the increase in beds.
Between 1985-1988, according to Mr Lem, a number of hotel development
certificates were distributed as 'political favours' - without either
adequate planning about how the new hotels were going to be filled, or
consideration of the environmental impact of this expansion. With low
occupancy rates the new hotels are struggling to make profits, despite
attempts to buy market share by cutting rates.
Furthermore, the unregulated growth in the number of hotels has had a
detrimental impact on the environment. Dumping of untreated sewage into the
seas and lagoons, particularly severe in the Grand Baie area, has had a
damaging impact on the marine ecosystem.
A moratorium on 20 new hotel projects expired last year, but Mr Lem says 16
of these projects have subsequently been shelved, and the government is
trying to persuade the other four not to go ahead. 'We are applying the
brakes on the further expansion of the tourist sector and at the same time
trying to widen the market to allow hotels to achieve the rate of occupancy
which is viable and profitable.'
All new hotel developments will now also be subject to an environmental
impact assessment under the new Ministry of the Environment.
If hotel development is slowed, and the growth in arrivals continues to
boom, Mauritius's capacity problem and the economic viability of hotels is
likely to ease considerably within the next three to four years. The
government has now abandoned an arbitrary limit of 400,000 arrivals by the
year 2000, and Mr Lem says Mauritius is a long way from the threshold of
tolerance of tourist arrivals, and that the ratio of tourist arrivals to
population is still so low that at least 500,000 arrivals by the end of the
century is acceptable and possible.
Two important challenges face the government in seeking to increase
arrivals: developing new markets, and developing the infrastructure for the
'second phase' of development.
Government is pinning its hopes on development of the Japanese and Indian
markets, and consolidation of the French, British, German and South African
markets. A once-a-week flight from Osaka to Mauritius is expected to start
by 1994. But hoteliers and tour operators say the Government Tourist Office
is weak and ineffective, and must develop a much more aggressive marketing
campaign. They say the MR65m allocated to promotion in this year's budget is
not enough.
The government will continue to ban charter flights, camping and caravan
sites, to discourage 'low budget' tourists and maintain Mauritius's image as
an upmarket destination for 'low volume high income'. The question remains
whether the sufficient growth in numbers can come from the high income
market alone.
Moreover, many 'low budget' tourists, especially from France, continue to
find their way to Mauritius by taking charters to Reunion and then making
the short (50 minutes) flight to Mauritius. Some hoteliers and tour
operators believe it would be better to accept that low budget tourists are
going to come, cater properly for them, and get the maximum revenue out of
them.
They also say that Mauritius remains an extremely expensive destination,
even for the high-income bracket tourist, and that only by considerably
improving the quality of the product and service will the industry be able
to continue to attract increased volume in the face of competition from
Kenya, Seychelles, Indonesia, Maldives and Thailand.
Development of infrastructure and added facilities will be critical to
further growth - as will maximising revenue by attracting tourists off the
beaches to spend more money on other activities. The development of the
National Handicraft Centre, and of inland facilities such as the 'Domain du
Chasseur,' a deer hunting and nature park, is being welcomed by the private
sector.
After a period of rapid growth the government is now facing crucial
decisions on how to consolidate and expand its thriving tourist sector to
ensure that continued growth will be sustainable.
