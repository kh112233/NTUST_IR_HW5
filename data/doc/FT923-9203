FT  06 AUG 92 / Members of Greenpeace arrested in Japanese plutonium protest
Japan's coastguard yesterday detained six activists of the environmental
group Greenpeace for questioning, hours after they hung a banner at a
shipyard (pictured above) to protest at plans to transport plutonium, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
A coastguard spokesman in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, said he did not know if
they would be formally arrested or when questioning would be completed. A
Greenpeace spokeswoman told a news conference the treatment was tantamount
to an arrest.
Riding in rubber boats, the group hung a 10-metre banner across a dry dock
housing the Akatsuki Maru, the ship due to carry one tonne of reprocessed
plutonium from France later this year.
The Akatsuki and an accompanying coastguard cutter are due to transport the
highly radioactive material for use in Japan's ambitious nuclear energy
programme. The timing and route of the shipment have been kept secret.
Rebecca Johnson, Greenpeace's co-ordinator for the plutonium issue, said
that Japan and Britain were giving contradictory accounts of the ownership
of the Akatsuki Maru.
Soon after the Greenpeace activists disembarked they were surrounded by some
25 coastguard officers and police, said Ms Johnson. Two Japanese, two
Britons, a Dutch national and an Australian were then taken to the
coastguard's Yokohama office.
