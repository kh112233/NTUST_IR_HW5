ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
COUNTYWIDE; 
$500 REWARD OFFERED FOR LOST POLICE DOG 
The Orange County Police Canine Assn. has offered a $500 reward for the return 
of a German shepherd that ran away from the Santa Ana police canine unit Monday 
after strong winds blew open a wooden gate at its handler's Westminster home. 
Vasko, a 5-year-old, male German shepherd, disappeared from the home of Officer 
Mike Fleet, near Springdale Drive and the San Diego Freeway, between midnight 
and 5 a.m., Santa Ana police spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. 
Fleet's family dog, a 6-month-old, black and white Alaskan malamute named 
Nakita, also ran away. Vasko, described as "very friendly," has an 
identification number, GH2999, tattooed inside his right ear. 
Vasko is used primarily in crime scene searches and searches for narcotics and 
missing persons, Thomas said. The dog also is used in demonstrations at Orange 
County schools. 
Thomas said Vasko obeys commands in both German and English and does not have a 
collar.
