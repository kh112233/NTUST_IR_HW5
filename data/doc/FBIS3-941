  [Text] The South African Police [SAP] will withdraw their 
security services at the country's airports as of 1 April. This 
will now be the duty of a private security firm while the SAP 
will be released to perform only policing duties. Divisional 
manager of protection services at Jan Smuts Airport, Mr. Andre 
Olivier, said the move will bring South African airports in line 
with international trends and will help cut costs.
