CARSON ARRANGES COLLECTION, RECYCLING OF CHRISTMAS TREES 
For the second consecutive year, the city of Carson has teamed with two private 
firms to recycle Christmas trees. 
Residents are being asked to place their trees -- minus ornaments, nails and 
stands -- curbside on their regular trash pickup day Wednesday, Thursday or 
Jan. 4. 
Western Waste Industries, the city refuse hauler, will pick up the trees and 
take them to Kellogg Supply, a Carson-based fertilizing company. The firm will 
grind up the trees to make compost. City officials said last January's pickup 
collected about 8,000 trees that produced 55 tons of compost chips. 
Flocked trees cannot be recycled but will be picked up with other garbage.
