  [Excerpts] His Majesty King Husayn arrived in Vienna this 
evening on a short visit to Austria during which his majesty 
will hold talks with top Austrian officials on developments in 
the Middle East peace process, the situation in the Balkan 
region, and bilateral relations. 
  Before this, his majesty visited the Jordanian troops 
operating within the international peacekeeping forces in 
Croatia. [passage omitted] 
  At the end of the visit, His Majesty King Husayn, commander 
in chief of the Jordanian Armed Forces, spoke to a number of 
Jordanian newspaper correspondents. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified 
Correspondent] Your Majesty the King, if you will allow me, I 
have a question about the talks Your Majesty held in the United 
States on the peace process. Can you tell us about the outcome 
of these talks, and since Jordan is concerned about the issue of 
peace, do you think that there is progress on the [Jordanian] 
track? 
  [Husayn] The visit was very successful. Contacts at all U.S. 
official levels were good, starting with President Clinton, the 
U.S. Administration, and many of those I met with who are 
concerned about peace in the entire region. Naturally, we began 
talks on the various tracks at that time. Afterwards, we 
followed reports from Davos and the meeting that was held there. 
I believe that there has been progress achieved on certain 
issues and that our stand is clear toward them. We supported 
our kinfolk and brothers until they decided to talk on behalf of 
themselves and we will continue to support them to the best of 
our ability. 
  We are seeking a comprehensive, durable, and just peace that 
is acceptable to future generations. However, in terms of the 
Jordanian-Israeli track, we began discussing the items on the 
agenda. We were never convinced of the proposals that have been 
presented from time to time on signing a peace treaty first and 
then starting discussions all the requirements of peace. We are 
marching toward peace, but we have to tackle all important 
issues in a manner that satisfies God, our consciences, and our 
people. May God bless us in this endeavor. 
  [Correspondent] Sir, can you give us the honor of reporting 
to the Jordanian citizens about your health condition? 
  [Husayn] May God bless you. Thanks be to God. The results 
were very good. They did not find any traces of the illness. 
They only asked that I undergo a final medical checkup within 
six months and then routine annual checkups, nothing more or 
less. Everything is good, thanks be to God. [end recording]
