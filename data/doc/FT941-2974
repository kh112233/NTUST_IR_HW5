FT  18 MAR 94 / New cancer drug shows promise in first tests
The first tests on patients of a new form of cancer treatment developed by a
British company have shown promising results, data published yesterday show.
British Biotechnology's drug batimastat performed well enough with 15
patients in the trial for investigators to give additional doses to some
patients.
Professor John Smyth of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund's Medical Oncology
Unit at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital said he was 'very encouraged'
by the results of the trial, which suggested the drug 'may be effective in
the treatment of ovarian cancer'. It had not shown significant side effects.
Batimastat works by acting against enzymes that destroy tissue surrounding
cancer cells.
If the drug does well in the next two years of clinical trials it could be
used in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including breast, lung,
colorectal and prostate, even on patients close to death. Mr James Noble,
finance director of British Biotechnology, said 650,000 people died of such
late-stage cancers each year in Europe and the US.
The second phase of clinical trials starts next month and the third phase,
which is needed for applications for approval by the world's health
regulatory bodies, should begin later this year. Cancer drugs often receive
priority treatment from regulatory bodies because so many patients do not
respond well enough to existing treatments.
Batimastat works by acting against enzymes that destroy tissue surrounding
cancer cells. By breaking down the tissues, the cancer can grow and spread.
British Biotechnology shares rose 5p to 450p yesterday.
