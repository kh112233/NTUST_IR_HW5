FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Why should the rich have all the fun? -
Hawks &amp; Handsaws
I HAVE always liked the rich. I have met thousands of them, I suppose, and
have always found them far more interesting, charming, witty, attractive and
intelligent than poor people.
Poor people are not interesting. Their views are plain-textured, their lives
monochromatic. They do not drive Aston Martins or collect Venetian glass or
holiday in Barbados or know anything about the gold price, so how can they
avoid the choking dust of dullness that settles, inevitably, upon a life
without money?
More of the poor in a minute. Dull they may be, but they do not go away. The
other reason I like rich people is that their stories and experiences are
much livelier than poor people's stories. Here is an example. I found it
this week in a book, Horsetrader, by Patrick Robinson, an account of Robert
Sangster's exploits as a racehorse owner. Sangster is rich, intelligent,
interesting.
One night Sangster and his wife Sue and an Irish friend of Sangster's, Billy
McDonald, a bloodstock agent from Ballynahinch, were on the beach outside
Sangster's house in Barbados, gazing at the distant lights of Michael
Smurfit's yacht. Suddenly, McDonald announced that he was fed up with all
this vodka. 'Dat bloddy boat of Smurfit's is packed with Chateau Petrus,' he
shouted, 'and I'm going out there to get a decent bottle.'
Upon which he plunged into the sea and began swimming, inexpertly, towards
the yacht. Slowly, McDonald's sounds grew fainter until, on the velvety
Barbadian air, came a waterlogged Irish roar: 'Oi'm bloddy drownin'. Fock
it]'
At once, Sangster's wife whipped off her skirt, knifed into the water and
swam strongly to the Irishman's resue. She got him on his back, grabbed his
hair, told him that if he wriggled, belched or spoke she would abandon him,
and dragged him 200 yards back to the beach, depositing him, poleaxed with
exhaustion, upon the sand.
'I'd say he owes you,' Sangster told his wife. 'None of us could have done
that. Shame about the Petrus.'
Nice story. I wish that poor people had such stories to tell. If I had three
wishes, I would wish that most rich people were somewhat poorer, that many
poor people were not so poor, and that some poor people were greatly richer.
I had better explain. I am not a professor, but if you ask me we seem to be
living through a period, in the western democracies, of political decadence
and moribundity. Things are badly skew-whiff. I am not talking about humdrum
recessions. Get rid of one and along comes another. I am talking about the
distortions and inequities that disfigure our economies - specifically, the
crudeness of our distribution of benefits between the haves and have-nots.
Take the US, an extremely decadent society that has lessons for us all.
According to an analysis by Neil Howe and Phillip Longman in The Atlantic
magazine some time ago: 'When we add together all the tax expenditures and
all the direct outlays for which we have data . . . an unambiguous picture
emerges. On average, households with incomes under Dollars 10,000 collected
a total of Dollars 5,690 in benefits (in 1991). On average, households with
incomes over Dollars 100,000 collected Dollars 9,280. In terms of total
fiscal cost . . . the aggregate amounts received by the non-needy in 1991
were staggering.'
Whatever one's vision of the future, they said - whether it was a negative
income tax or a 15 per cent flat rate; green cars running on hydrogen or
mag-lev trains humming between cities - to get something new, one must give
up something old. 'A society that cannot find the resources to pay for
60-cent tuberculosis vaccinations for 10-year-olds must ask itself why it is
offering subsidised health care and housing to millionaires.'
Shuffling government ministers around is low-grade sport compared with the
shuffling of resources between the haves and have-nots, where progress will
be slow. To ginger things up - to provide more people with stories - I
would, at random, sequester the fortunes of one deceased multi-millionaire
in seven and divide the spoils between 15 poor people.
They could spend it how they liked. Aston Martins. Crates of Petrus. Homes
in Barbados. Tickets to Royal Ascot. Elocution lessons. Founding businesses.
Why should the rich have all the best stories?
