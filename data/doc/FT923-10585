FT  30 JUL 92 / German warning on right-wing terrorism
THE radical right-wing in Germany now presents as big a threat to internal
security as left-wing urban guerrillas once did, the government said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
At least 4,400 of the 40,000 right-wing extremists in Germany are prone to
violence and some may want to stockpile weapons for possible terrorist
attacks, it said in a written answer to a query in parliament. 'The
government takes the dangers to internal security arising from right-wing
extremism and xenophobia as seriously as the left-wing extremist attacks of
the 1970s,' it said.
Skinheads make up 4,200 of the 4,400 violent right-wingers identified by
Bonn's internal security watchdog, the Federal Office for the Protection of
the Constitution (BFV). The Ku Klux Klan from the US was also active in
providing neo-Nazi propaganda, the government said.
