FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SmithKline alliance with genes company
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceutical group, is setting up a
wide-ranging strategic alliance with Human Genome Sciences, one of the new
wave of US companies set up to identify the structure and function of human
genes in health and disease.
The goal is to convert genetic discoveries into new drugs and diagnostic
products. By the nature of pharmaceutical research, these are unlikely to
reach the market for several years.
The companies refused to disclose any financial details, but SB will have to
spend tens of millions of pounds on R&amp;D if the collaboration is to lead to
significant new products.
Dr George Poste, SB's pharmaceutical R&amp;D chairman, said the work would lead
to new drugs and vaccines and also to accurate molecular tests for the early
detection of disease, including the identification of people at risk before
any symptoms have appeared.
