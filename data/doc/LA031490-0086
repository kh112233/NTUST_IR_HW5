DECEMBER TRAIN CRASH BLAMED ON SPEEDING TRUCKER 
An Amtrak passenger train crash that killed three people and injured dozens on 
a foggy day last December was caused by the driver of a speeding truck that 
smashed through warning gates and hit the train, investigators said Tuesday. 
A report by an investigative task force concluded that the driver "was going 
too fast for the foggy conditions" at the crash site near Stockton, said 
California Highway Patrol spokesman Bob Whitmire. 
The truck driver was one of those killed. 
The findings contradict a statement by a motorist who was following the 
big-rig. The motorist said that warning equipment at the railroad crossing was 
not working, Whitmire said. 
The driver, David Haskell, 47, was killed instantly as the cab of the big-rig 
shattered. The engineer and fireman, who were operating the train within the 
speed limit, were burned to death when flames engulfed the derailed engine, 
Whitmire said. 
The five-car train, carrying more than 140 people, was southbound from Oakland 
to Bakersfield when the crash occurred on Dec. 19.
