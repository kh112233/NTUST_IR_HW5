Secondary Direct Food Additives Permitted in Food for Human Consumption; Perfluorinated Ion Exchange Membranes



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of a perfluorinated
ion exchange membrane intended for repeated use in the treatment of bulk quantities of liquid foods at temperatures
up to 70 


C

 (158 


C

). The membrane is a copolymer of ethanesufonyl fluoride, 2-[1-[difluoro-[(trifluoroethenyl)oxy]methyl]-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy]-1,1,2,2,-tetrafluoro-
with tetrafluoroethylene that is subsequently treated to hydrolyze the sulfonyl fluoride group to the sulfonic
acid. This action is in response to a petition filed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 21, 1989 (54 FR 7519), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 9B4123) had been filed by E.I. du
Pont de Nemours and Co., Wilmington, DE 19898. The petition proposed that the food additive regulations in part 173


Secondary Direct Food Additives Permitted in Food for Human Consumption

 (21 CFR part 173) be amended to provide for the safe use of a fluorocarbon resin, manufactured by the reaction of tetrafluoroethylene
and perfluoro(4-methyl-3,6-dioxa-7-octene-1-sulfonyl fluoride), and followed by hydrolysis of the sulfonyl
fluoride group to sulfonic acid, for use as a membrane to process food. 


FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the
food additive is safe, and that part 173 should be amended by adding new 173.21 to subpart A, as set forth below.
The additive was described in the filing noitce by nomenclature commonly used in industry. In accordance with agency
policy, the listing in new 173.21 uses Chemical Abstracts nomenclature.
In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before May 4, 1994, file with the Dockets
Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered, and
each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection is
made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.


List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 173


Food additives.
Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs and redelegated to the Director, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 21 CFR part 173 is amended
as follows:


PART 173_SECONDARY DIRECT FOOD ADDITIVES PERMITTED IN FOOD FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION


1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 173 continues to read as follows: 





Authority:

 Secs. 201, 402, 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 342, 348).



2. New 173.21 is added to subpart A to read as follows:


173.21 

Perfluorinated ion exchange membranes. 


Substances identified in paragraph (a) of this section may be safely used as ion exchange membranes intended for use
in the treatment of bulk quantities of liquid food under the following prescribed conditions:
(a) 

Identity

. The membrane is a copolymer of ethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2-[1-[difluoro-[(trifluoroethenyl)oxy]methyl]-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy]-1,1,2,2,-tetrafluoro-,
with tetrafluoroethylene that has been subsequently treated to hydrolyze the sulfonyl fluoride group to the sulfonic
acid. The Chemical Abstracts Service name of this polymer is ethanesulfonic acid, 2-[1-[difluoro-[(trifluoroethenyl)oxy]methyl]-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy]-1,1,2,2,-tetrafluoro-,
polymer with tetrafluoroethane (CAS Reg. No. 31175209). 
(b) 

Optional adjuvant substances

. The basic polymer identified in paragraph (a) of this section may contain optional adjuvant substances required
in the production of such basic polymer. These optional adjuvant substances may include substances used in accordance
with 174.5 of this chapter. 
(c) 

Conditions of use

. (1) Perfluorinated ion exchange membranes described in paragraph (a) of this section may be used in contact with
all types of liquid foods at temperatures not exceeding 70 


C

 (158 


F

).
(2) Maximum thickness of the copolymer membrane is 0.007 inch (0.017 centimeter).
(3) Perfluorinated ion exchange membranes shall be maintained in a sanitary manner in accordance with current good
manufacturing practice so as to prevent microbial adulteration of food.
(4) To assure their safe use, perfluorinated ionomer membranes shall be thoroughly cleaned prior to their first use
in accordance with current good manufacturing practice.
