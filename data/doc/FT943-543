FT  29 SEP 94 / Bow doors leak reported after 800 die in Baltic ferry
sinking
Officials from Sweden, Finland and Estonia yesterday began investigating the
cause of Europe's worst maritime disaster since the second world war amid
reports that water flooding in through the bow doors caused the ferry
Estonia to capsize.
More than 800 lives were lost when the 21,794 tonne ferry, sailing from the
Estonian capital Tallinn to Stockholm, sank within minutes early yesterday
morning in the Baltic Sea 40km south west of the Finnish island of Uto.
There were 964 passengers and crew aboard, and a full cargo of cars and
heavy trucks.
The sinking of the Estonia is expected to lead to renewed calls for
improvements to ferry safety despite recent international efforts to raise
standards. Roll-on roll-off ferries present particular problems because of
their large open car and truck decks. These lack dividing bulkheads, which
give extra protection against capsizing to other vessels.
The world's shipping nations agreed on tougher rules governing the stability
of ships in 1990, although Britain, Sweden and eight other European nations
have agreed higher standards which take effect on October 1.
Last night, Mr Raimo Tiilikainen, the leader of the Finnish rescue
operation, said teams of helicopters and ships had rescued 141 people and
recovered 42 bodies. But he said 781 people were missing and officials said
there was little hope of finding anyone alive in the cold Baltic waters.
Estline, the joint Swedish-Estonian operator of the ship, said it could not
explain the sudden capsize and sinking. It said the last radio message from
the bridge reported the engines had failed and the ship was listing badly.
However, a member of the crew, Mr Henrik Sillaste, said he saw water burst
into the car deck past the bow loading ramp shortly before the vessel
foundered. 'On the TV monitor in the machine room, we could see water
rushing in on the car deck,' he told reporters.
Two Swedish maritime inspectors who saw the vessel in Tallinn on Tuesday
said the rubber seals around the bow doors were partly damaged, but not to a
dangerous degree. They were quoted as saying: 'We saw ageing and worn-out
lashings and seals which had been damaged. But none of the faults was so big
it could have caused the disaster.'
The 14-year old German built vessel was regarded as being well designed to
deal with tough conditions in the Baltic Sea.
The speculation that the disaster was caused by water coming in through the
bow doors raised alarming comparisons with the sinking of the Herald of Free
Enterprise outside the Belgian port of Zeebrugge in 1987. The Herald
capsized with the loss of 189 lives after the bow doors had not been closed
properly.
Some 500 of the Estonia's missing and dead were Swedes and most of the rest
were Estonians. Both countries declared a national state of mourning.
The Estonia began sailing between Stockholm and Tallinn in February 1993 for
Estline, a company jointly owned by the state-owned Estonian Shipping
Company and Sweden's Nordstrom &amp; Thulin. It was reported to have been
insured for Pounds 38m, about half of this through the London marine market.
