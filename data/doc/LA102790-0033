VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO; 
MAN JUMPS TO SAFETY AS TRAIN HITS TRUCK 
A Point Mugu man stalled his pickup truck on railroad tracks in Camarillo 
Friday afternoon, jumping from the cab seconds before an oncoming freight train 
smashed the truck into a post, officials said. 
Jerry Joseph Alarcon, 46, was driving south on Las Posas Road, the sun in his 
eyes, approaching East Fifth Street when he noticed the railroad crossing arms 
were down, said California Highway Patrolman Brian Demattia. 
Alarcon tried to brake, but his foot slipped onto the accelerator, Demattia 
said. 
After crashing through one of the crossing arms, the truck stalled and Alarcon 
could not restart it, Demattia said. 
A Southern Pacific freight train traveling west smashed the truck into a 
control box post, scattering the camper shell and its contents along the 
tracks, he said. 
Alarcon suffered minor injuries from his jump. Officials closed Las Posas Road 
for about 45 minutes while the accident scene was cleared. KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ
