FT  30 APR 93 / Iraq nerve agent evidence found
EVIDENCE that Iraq used lethal nerve agent weapons as well as mustard gas
against its own Kurdish citizens in 1988 has been found by scientists at the
UK's Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment.
Soil samples from the village of Birjinni in northern Iraq have shown traces
of the nerve agent sarin. Iraq is also alleged to have used nerve agents in
the attack on Halabja near the Iraq-Iran border earlier in 1988, but this
has not been proven.
Although nerve agents have existed since the 1930s, when sarin and other
substances were developed by Nazi Germany, this is the first ever documented
evidence of use.
A British official said Iraq was probably the first country to have employed
nerve gas, which affects the central nervous system, causing breathing
difficulties, involuntary movements and death.
Scientists of the US organisation Physicians for Human Rights collected the
samples in 1992 from the craters left by one of three bomb clusters.
Dr Graham Pearson, the CBDE's director general, said one set of samples
provided traces of mustard gas, which damages the skin, respiratory tract
and eyes. The other set, including metal fragments, contained an acid that
Dr Pearson said could only have come from sarin.
Four people are known to have died after the attack. But samples from the
graves of two victims showed no traces of chemical weapons.
The attack took place in August 25, shortly after the ceasefire between Iran
and Iraq. It is believed to have been the last time Iraqi forces made use of
their nerve weapons.
Dr Pearson said he hoped the findings would deter states from thinking they
could get away with chemical warfare without leaving evidence. They would
help to underpin the Chemical Weapons Convention which, since it was opened
for signature in January, has been signed by 145 countries and will come
into force at the earliest in January 1995.
Iraq's stockpile of chemical arms is in the process of being destroyed under
UN auspices. But a British official admitted; 'You can never be absolutely
certain that you have detected all the weapons.'
