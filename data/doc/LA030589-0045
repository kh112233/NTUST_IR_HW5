TOURISTS RECRUITED TO PRESERVE WILD DOGS 
Scientists at Kruger National Park are recruiting tourists to help them track, 
count and conserve the African wild dog, the most endangered large carnivore on 
the continent. 
The big-eared dogs have intricately patterned coats, each one distinct enough 
so individual animals can be identified from photographs. Once scientists know 
how many wild dogs there are and how they move, they will begin drawing up 
conservation plans. 
South Africa's National Parks Board and the private Endangered Wildlife Trust 
have started a contest to get tourists to take pictures of the animals and send 
the prints in with information on location, pack size and number of young. 
About 1,000 photographs have been entered in the contest, which began in 
January and runs through July. 
The first prize is a free trip to a South African national park and the 
runner-up prizes are photo equipment. 
'Not Scared of Vehicles' 
"We could drive through the park for a month and never see one wild dog, but 
probably every day someone somewhere in the park sees them. They stay close to 
the road and they are not scared of vehicles," said Gus Mills, head of predator 
research at the park. 
He said he believes there are about 300 in the park, the biggest group in 
Africa. Others are in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and parts of East Africa. 
"They move long distances and seem sometimes to go out of the park. When that 
happens, they get into trouble," said Mills. 
Since wild dog packs hunt by day and don't fear humans, they are easy targets 
for farmers protecting their livestock. Mills said a farmer whose land borders 
the park recently shot 20 dogs. 
"People have an exaggerated hatred for wild dogs; it's somewhat like the way 
the wolf is regarded in America," Mills said.
