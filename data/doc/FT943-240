FT  30 SEP 94 / Labour attacks cost of Welsh quangos
The 10 largest quangos in Wales spend more than Pounds 26m a year on board
members and administration, the Labour party said yesterday.
Publishing a survey of quango costs, Labour claimed 'vast sums' were being
spent on their executive tier and on 'wasteful' overheads. It argued that
the amount would amply fund an elected Welsh assembly which, together with
local authorities, could take over control of their board functions.
Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, said in Cardiff: 'The existing quango
system is not only unaccountable but has become inefficient and in some
cases corrupt.' The survey, he said, 'demolishes comprehensively' the
Conservatives' argument for retaining quangos that a Welsh assembly would
cost too much.
While Mr Davies stressed his support for the work of many of the quangos,
including the Welsh Development Agency, he said: 'I am convinced that local
government and a Welsh assembly could do the job of quango boards cheaper
and more efficiently, not to mention with more accountability and probity.'
He added: 'We have in effect an extra tax in Wales to pay for the Tories'
political failure. They need quangos to find jobs for failed Tories because
they can't win elections.' The Conservatives hold only six of the 38
parliamentary seats in Wales.
The survey, based on replies to a questionnaire sent to 110 Welsh
non-departmental public bodies, or quangos, found that the 10 largest paid
their total of 89 board members an average of Pounds 10,495 a year each in
remuneration and expenses.
This compared with an average of under Pounds 3,000 in allowances and
expenses for Welsh councillors. Their administrative costs, including
buildings and expenses but excluding staff salaries, totalled Pounds 25.6m.
