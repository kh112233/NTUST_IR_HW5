FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Healthy forecast
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, reports its second
quarter results on Tuesday. Analysts expect a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 280m, excluding any one-time exceptional items such as
disposals to Wella and Sara Lee. The dividend is likely to be unchanged.
Sales are expected to be up by about 25 per cent in the pharmaceuticals
division and the group. Both figures will be assisted by currencies.
Analysts will be looking for strong growth from Engerix-B, the hepatitis B
vaccine, Seroxat, an anti-depressant, Kytril, an anti-nausea treatment.
Relafen, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory for arthritis, and Augmentin,
an anti-biotic. The latter may overtake SB's anti-ulcer treatment Tagamet as
the company's most important drug.
The impact of the healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy will be carefully
monitored, as will the company's progress in the increasingly competitive US
market.

pre-tax profits of between Pounds 75m and Pounds 80m against Pounds 62.5m a

and from expanding business in the Far East and Pacific Rim countries. Full
year profits for the year ending December are forecast at about Pounds 180m
(Pounds 144m).
First Technology, a maker of crash dummies and security equipment for the
car industry, is forecast to turn in a big increase in pre-tax profits to

enjoyed a pick up in US demand.
