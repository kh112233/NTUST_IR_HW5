U.S. Patent 5,221,825 and U.S. Patent Application 08/065,393 relate to methods of sensing gas-metal-arc welding
process characteristics and correcting flaws indicated by the detected process characteristics.

NIST may enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (``CRADA'') to perform further research on
the invention for purposes of commercialization. The CRADA may be conducted by NIST without any additional charge
to any party that licenses the patent. NIST may grant the licensee an option to negotiate for royalty-free exclusive
licenses to any jointly owned inventions which arise from the CRADA as well as an option to negotiate for exclusive
royalty-bearing licenses for NIST employee inventions which arise from the CRADA.
