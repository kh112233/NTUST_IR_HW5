<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Notice is hereby given that the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) has made final findings of scientific misconduct
in the following case: 





Gerald J. August, Ph.D., University of Minnesota Medical School:

 The Division of Research Investigations (DRI) of the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) reviewed an investigation
conducted by the University of Minnesota into possible scientific misconduct on the part of Gerald J. August, Ph.D.,
an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Minnesota Medical School. The University concluded that
Dr. August committed scientific misconduct by plagiarizing materials in a Public Health Service (PHS) grant application
which he obtained as a member of a PHS Special Study Section. ORI concurred with the University's findings. Dr. August
accepted the misconduct findings and agreed to a Voluntary Settlement Agreement under which, for a five year period
beginning May 6, 1994, (1) Dr. August will not serve on PHS advisory committees, boards, or peer review groups and (2)
he is to submit a certification with each document, application, or report that he submits to a PHS component that the
work of others contained in the document, application, or report is properly attributed.
