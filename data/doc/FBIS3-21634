  [Text] Alleged Valle Department drug trafficker Jaime 
Orejuela will not be released as was thought. The Cali regional 
prosecutor's office has issued a warrant for his arrest. 
  "National Newscast" established, through high-level sources 
within the Dijin [Judicial Police and Investigations 
Directorate], that an arrest warrant was issued yesterday by the 
Cali regional prosecutor's office against Jaime Orejuela 
Caballero for the illegal possession of weapons. Also, the 
Bogota regional prosecutor's office has another preliminary 
investigation under way for illegal profiteering. 
  With the Cali arrest warrant, Orejuela Caballero will be 
unable to gain his freedom or be extradited to the United States 
where he is sought for his role in cocaine production, 
possession, and distribution. In addition, the Colombian 
Constitution forbids the extradition of native-born Colombian 
citizens. 
  The DEA has also reported that Orejuela Caballero was 
involved in the murder of his former wife, and he is under 
investigation for his role in counterfeiting and arms 
trafficking to Colombia.
