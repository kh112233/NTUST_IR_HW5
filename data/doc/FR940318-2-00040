<DOCTITLE>J  T Hydro Co.; Availability of Final Environmental Assessment</DOCTITLE>


March 14, 1994.


In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for an original, minor license for the proposed Ramseur Hydroelectric Project, located on the Deep
River, in the City of Ramseur, Randolph County, North Carolina, and has prepared a Final Environmental Assessment
(FEA) for the project. In the FEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the
project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigative and enhancement measures, would
not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
The Notice of Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment for the Ramseur Hydroelectric Project was issued on
December 8, 1993. In response, the Commission received two comment letters which were reviewed by the Commission's
staff and addressed in the FEA.
Copies of the FEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.
