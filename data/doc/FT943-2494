FT  19 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Drugs on diet
The growth rate of Glaxo's R&amp;D spending is decelerating fast. Increases of
25 per cent and 24 per cent during 1992 and 1993 have been followed by a
budgeted rise of only 16 per cent this year. The company expects the budget
to advance only 4.8 per cent in 1995. Part of this reflects Glaxo's own
development programme which has just completed a particularly busy period.
But the slowdown also underscores a more general trend. Last year 11 of the
top 12 US groups moderated the growth of their R&amp;D spending. Three actually
cut their budgets.
The slackening rate of R&amp;D spending is not necessarily damaging for the
sector which had been raising R&amp;D budgets to unsustainable levels. Worldwide
R&amp;D investment expanded from Dollars 5.5bn in 1981 to an astonishing Dollars
30bn last year. To obtain a return of 10 per cent on that sum by 2004, the
world drugs market would have to reach Dollars 448bn, compared with a
present size of about Dollars 200bn. That would require market growth of 8.4
per cent a year, more than double the present rate.
Concerns that slowing investment growth will mean fewer innovative medicines
are unjustified. Much of the recent rise in spending was used to create
worldwide development capabilities. For most groups these are now in place.
Moreover, the waste in the pharmaceuticals industry has been legendary, with
R&amp;D departments among the worst offenders. Drugs groups will have to raise
their productivity by spending their money more wisely. Those failing to do
so will prove incapable of finding the new medicines necessary for survival.
