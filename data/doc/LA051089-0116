ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE; 
CEREMONY TO HONOR POLICE WHO LOST LIVES 
A memorial ceremony will be held Monday in Santa Ana for three Orange County 
police officers who have died in the line of duty within the past year, 
Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said. 
Three plaques commemorating Seal Beach Police Officer Edward William Clavell 
Jr., Anaheim Motorcycle Officer Robert T. Roulston and Sheriff's Deputy Mark 
Tonkin will be added to the 25 plaques already on the memorial, Olson said. 
Each plaque honors an officer who has died in the line of duty since 1889. 
Clavell, 31, died in a chase last August. Roulston, 38, died in a motorcycle 
accident last October, and Tonkin, 31, died during the same month in a 
helicopter crash near the Mexican border while on a drug interdiction mission. 
The ceremony will be held at 11 a.m. on the Plaza of the Flags at the Civic 
Center in Santa Ana. Best-selling author and former police officer Joseph 
Wambaugh will be the keynote speaker.
