FT  22 DEC 94 / World Bank doubts on dam
A World Bank plan to help finance a Dollars 1bn hydro-electric project in
Nepal has come under fire from the bank's own newly established inspection
panel, raising doubts about its ability to become involved in this sector.
The panel, established in November after complaints from four Nepalese, said
in an initial report that the project to dam the Arun river, involved
'apparent violations of policy that require further investigation'. Bank
officials fear that other countries may be discouraged from seeking bank
help for hydro-electric schemes if the project, which Germany and Japanese
companies are to help finance, does not go ahead. China has deliberately
avoided seeking World Bank finance for its controversial Three Gorges dam,
which is much more controversial.
