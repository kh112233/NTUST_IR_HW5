FT  22 FEB 94 / Romania bails errant reporter
Romanian police have freed on bail a reporter arrested for writing an
article that likened President Ion Iliescu to a fairy-tale pig, Reuter
reports from Bucharest. The article mixed a well-known fairy tale with
elements of Mr Iliescu's past as a top communist. He was accused of
'offending state authority', a charge which the old communist regime used to
silence critics.
