FT  22 DEC 94 / Twenty die in Burundi clashes
About 20 people were killed in two days of ethnic attacks in Burundi's
capital Bujumbura which have brought the city close to a standstill, police
said yesterday. Residents said Tuesday night was punctuated by the blasts of
about 50 hand grenades and outbreaks of shooting following the killing of
five people - most of them members of the Hutu majority - in the main market
on Tuesday.
There have been widespread fears of a full-blown ethnic war after genocide
between April and July in neighbouring Rwanda, Burundi's ethnic twin. In
October and November, hundreds of people in Burundi were killed in attacks
by Hutu extremists and in army reprisals
The latest attacks focused on the capital's northeast district of Bwiza,
where witnesses said at least a dozen houses were set ablaze and destroyed.
Buildings were still burning yesterday. Troops in Bwiza, one of the few
remaining mixed districts of Tutsis and Hutus, told reporters at least 10
people were killed.
