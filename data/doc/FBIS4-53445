  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Local assemblies across 
Japan have called on the government to assert Japanese 
sovereignty within the country's 200-nautical-mile territorial 
waters, fisheries organization officials said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Officials of the National Federation of Fisheries 
Cooperative 
Associations said that so far assemblies of 22 prefectures and 
274 cities, towns and villages have passed resolutions or issued 
statements to that effect since September. 
  They said that more assemblies are intending to move 
likewise 
to urge the government to put an end to poaching in territorial 
waters by fishermen from such countries as South Korea and China. 
  The officials said Japanese fishing communities are 
suffering 
greatly from losses of revenue due to the government's lax 
enforcement. 
  Japan declared a 200-nautical-mile exclusion zone in 1977, 
but does not apply it in the case of South Korea and China, with 
which it has territorial disputes. 
  South Korean and Chinese fishermen have taken advantage of 
this, trawling for crabs, squid and flatfish as close as 12 
nautical miles off the coast, they said. 
  They ignore regulations that Japanese fishermen must abide 
by 
and use methods that damage maritime resources, officials said.
