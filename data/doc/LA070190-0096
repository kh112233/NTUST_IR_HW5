LOVING AND LOSING A CHILD OF ADOPTION 
Two days ago a family was told they must give up their 17-month-old son to his 
birth mother. As a prospective adoptive mom, I can't imagine the horror this 
child's adoptive parents are going through. 
I am outraged. 
This is an issue that pro-choice and pro-life forces can join together on. It 
is also an issue on which birth parents and adoptive parents can agree. It is a 
matter of being pro-family and pro-child. 
Families, like my husband and I, who tried for years to have a child are so 
eager to love and cherish our adopted children. They are no different to us 
than any biological child. They are our children. 
Why, after struggling for so many years and suffering disappointment after 
disappointment, must we be afraid that a birth mother can after six months' 
time (or in this instance 17 months) take our child away from us? 
Think of the impact on the child. He is being ripped away from his loving 
parents to go live with someone he doesn't even know. 
The biological process of conception is not what makes you a parent. It is the 
wonderful hours rocking the baby to sleep, playing with the baby, feeding the 
baby, staying awake at night when the child has a cold, seeing the first smile. 
This issue is not anti-birth parents. We want to tell our children that their 
birth parents loved them and made a very difficult but loving choice. Loving 
their children, they should want their child to have the best that life has to 
offer.
