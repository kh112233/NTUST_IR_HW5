FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Argentine group raises Dollars
200m to cut debt
SOCIEDAD Comercial del Plata, a Buenos Aires-based holding company, plans to
raise about Dollars 200m in a combined disposal of assets and international
rights issue in order to reduce its heavy debt burden.
SCP, like other large Argentine holding companies, has grown rapidly over
the past three years by buying privatised companies.
However, in the process SCP has built up Dollars 300m in debts as it has
acquired minority stakes in energy companies and utilities.
SCP has sold for Dollars 112.5m its 5 per cent stake in Cointel, a vehicle
that controls one of Argentina's two privatised telephone companies, to
Cointel's operator, Telefonica of Spain.
SCP also plans to raise Dollars 80m in a local and international rights
issue and a further Dollars 4.6m through a smaller asset sale.
Other Argentine conglomerates are reorganising and shuffling stakes in
utilities between each other as Argentina's privatisation programme winds
down.
In part, this is due to new corporate strategies and to the need to reduce
debt. In SCP's case, debt was equivalent to its 1992 turnover of Dollars
310.8m.
SCP's stake in Cointel has proved highly profitable, growing in value by
more than 500 per cent since privatisation in November 1990.
However, SCP will retain its 25 per cent holding of preferred stock in
Telefonica de Argentina, the telephone company which is controlled by
Cointel.
SCP said that as well as strengthening its balance sheet and reaping a
substantial profit from Cointel, it wanted to concentrate resources in
investments which enabled it to exercise some management control over
companies.
Last week, the Citilec consortium, in which Sociedad Comercial and National
Grid Company of the UK each have a 15 per cent stake, won a concession to
run Argentina's electricity distribution system.
