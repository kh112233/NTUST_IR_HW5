FT  13 MAY 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): ICL system adjusts screen
brightness
Most computer users adjust their screen once and work regardless of light
conditions. ICL has launched a system called Autobrite which automatically
adjusts the screen to match surrounding levels.
'Visual ergonomics is a big problem,' says Bjorn Malmberg, technical
co-ordinator at ICL Personal Systems. 'People can get red-eyed, tired and
develop headaches when reading from the screen.' Two detectors in the
Autobrite module sense lighting conditions at the front and back of the
screen; these are compared with pre-set correction tables and brightness and
contrast are changed accordingly.
ICL (owned by Japan's Fujitsu) has linked up with Helvar, a Finnish lighting
company, to add an infra-red controlled office lighting system.
