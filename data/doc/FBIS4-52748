  [Text] Nemuro, Hokkaido, May 13 KYODO -- The latest group 
of Japanese to make a visa-free visit to the Russian-held 
islands off Hokkaido's eastern tip returned Friday [13 May] 
after two nights on Kunashiri Island. 
  Entering the third year of the visa-free exchanges, the 48 
Japanese, led by Jun Katagi, head of the prefectural 
government's general affairs office, was the first group of the 
year to travel to the disputed islands. A Russian group visited 
Hokkaido in April. 
  The group departed Wednesday and arrived in Furukamappu, 
Kunashiri, and spent the evening with island residents. 
  The group visited an elementary school and a museum Thursday 
and in the evening took part in a discussion meeting with 
island's residents and were hosted to a dinner party. 
  Before this visit, the Russians had asked the Japanese 
charter vessel to fly the Russian flag alongside the Japanese 
flag and to use the name "Russia" in filling out arrival 
documents. 
  The visitors complied with the requests, but the 
negotiations 
delayed the arrival by an hour and 30 minutes. 
  A second group of 48 is scheduled to leave for Etorofu 
Island 
on Saturday. 
  The two islands along with Shikotan Island and the Habomai 
group of islets were taken over by the Soviet Red Army at the 
end of World War II, but Japan has continued to claim 
sovereignty over what it terms the "northern territories." The 
island dispute has prevented Tokyo and Moscow from ever 
concluding a peace treaty.
