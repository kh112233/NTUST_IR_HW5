FT  10 FEB 93 / Poland agrees to take back refugees
POLAND yesterday agreed to take back refugees rejected by Germany, but both
countries failed to decide how Warsaw could deal with tens of thousands of
refugees once the German parliament amends its liberal asylum laws.
Mr Jerzy Zimowski, Polish deputy interior minister, said in Bonn Poland
needed financial aid and advice on improving border security while Polish
government officials accused Germany of 'exporting' its refugee problem.
But Mr Johannes Vocking, Germany's state secretary at the Interior Ministry,
hailed the agreement as a 'crucial step' towards pushing through the
constitutional amendments to the asylum law, agreed in principle by the
country's main political parties last December. The amendments would allow
Germany to send back refugees who are not genuine asylum-seekers to a safe
third country.
However, the opposition Social Democratic party and the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees have said Poland, the Czechs and Slovaks have no
infrastructure to deal with refugees.
