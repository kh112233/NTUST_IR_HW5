mandates that EPA develop guidelines for homeowners and other persons who may engage in renovation and remodeling

of lead hazards when conducting RR activities in homes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The draft RR guidelines text is available as an electronic file on the Federal Bulletin Board at 9 a.m. on the date
of publication in the 

Federal Register

. By modem dial 2025121387 or call 2025121530 for disks or paper copies. The document is
available in WordPerfect and ASCII formats.



 Under the Congressional mandate in section 402(c)(1) of TSCA, EPA has developed guidance for homeowners and building
occupants to alert them to potential lead hazards associated with renovation and remodeling activities (which may
create a risk of exposure to dangerous levels of lead). Congress specifically required that these guidelines be developed
for homes and buildings constructed prior to 1978. It is further mandated that these guidelines are to be distributed
through paint and hardware stores, employee organizations and trade groups, State and local agencies, and through
other appropriate means.

The Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics is seeking public comment on all aspects of the content and design of
the RR Guidelines document.

In particular, EPA requests comment on the tone of the document, and the extent to which the current wording and design
tend to support (or undermine) its effectiveness as an informational tool. One issue that EPA has considered is the
need to balance technical accuracy with clarity and freedom from overly technical jargon. The extent to which the
current draft is clear and understandable is of primary concern to the Agency, given the broad distribution that the
document will have.

In addition to soliciting public input through this notice, EPA will conduct a series of focus group reviews on the
draft RR guidelines document to evaluate the effectiveness of the current reading level, content, and graphic
presentation. EPA will include a summary of the focus groups' test results when it announces the availability of the
final RR guidelines document in the 

Federal Register

.

EPA also recognizes that this lead hazard information may be important in some communities that may have a limited
ability to utilize information provided in English. For that reason, EPA is developing a Spanish language version
of the Guidelines document as well. The Spanish-language RR guidelines document will be available after the
English version has been completed.
