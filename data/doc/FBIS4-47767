  [Text] The likely victory of the African National Congress 
in South Africa's first all-race elections has been welcomed by 
several countries as a new political and economic dawn for the 
country. Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata welcomed the 
expected victory of Nelson Mandela's ANC, and said South Africa 
was now heading for democracy. 
  Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans forecast 
the 
emergence of a new economic triangle in the Indian Ocean region, 
following South Africa's return to the international fold. 
  In Hong Kong, it was said the results were predictable, and 
the greatest reason for confidence in the new South Africa was 
the quality of its leaders.
