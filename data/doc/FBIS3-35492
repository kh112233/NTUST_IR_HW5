  [Text] The settler who this morning murdered the Arab 
worshipers in the Cave of the Patriarchs is Dr. Barukh 
Goldstein, a Qiryat Arba' doctor. Dr. Goldstein immigrated from 
the United States. He was a Kakh member and was its candidate 
to the Qiryat Arba' local elections. During the shooting spree, 
Dr. Goldstein wore his IDF [Israel Defense Forces] uniform with 
the insignia of his rank of captain in the military reserves. 
Dr. Goldstein was killed after the shooting, but it is not 
clear whether he committed suicide or the worshipers killed him.
