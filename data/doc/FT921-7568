FT  21 FEB 92 / Cheney urges halt to Condor missiles
MR Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, pressed Argentina to keep its promise
to halt the Condor II medium-range missile project and impose tighter
controls on other sensitive projects, especially its small nuclear
technology industry.
Mr Cheney arrived yesterday in Buenos Aires as part of a tour of five Latin
American republics.
The US is leading an international campaign to halt the Condor project. The
Argentine air force has systematically evaded civilian control and is
believed to have transferred Condor designs to Middle Eastern countries.
Only last week did the air force formally transfer the Condor to a civilian
space commission.
Mr Cheney's visit comes as the region's armed forces are searching for a new
role, now that civilians govern South America. Mr Cheney gave his firm
backing to efforts to professionalise the military.
Mr Erman Gonzalez, Argentine defence minister, agreed broadly with Mr
Cheney.
The Argentines demanded that Washington resume arms sales to its armed
forces. Mr Cheney did offer to supply some equipment, but the US has
informally backed Britain's arms embargo, introduced at the time of the 1982
Falklands conflict, by withholding sensitive hardware.
Argentina wants to buy second-hand F-16 jet fighters, a move opposed by
London.
