SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SANTEE 
A Santee man was shot and killed Sunday in a dispute over a borrowed car, 
according to a spokesman for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. 
John Reynolds, 27, was shot in the back with a single shotgun blast at 6:53 
p.m. in his apartment, in the 8800 block of Olive Lane, said sheriff's 
dispatcher Chris Hinshaw. 
Reynolds' roommate, Alan Anthonis, 28, scaled a back-yard fence and fled on 
foot, evading police dogs and a helicopter search, Hinshaw said. The men had 
argued about the condition of the car Reynolds had borrowed from Anthonis, 
according to Hinshaw. 
Anthonis was still being sought Monday night.
