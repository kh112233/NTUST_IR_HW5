FRANCE COOL TO KING HUSSEIN'S PLEA 
King Hussein of Jordan pleaded Monday for dialogue with Iraq, but French 
President Francois Mitterrand said that only an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait 
could lead to a peaceful outcome to the Persian Gulf crisis. 
"There has to be no embargo on dialogue, there has to be dialogue to get us to 
achieve results," the king told reporters after nearly an hour with Mitterrand 
at the Elysee Palace. 
A Mitterrand spokesman quoted the French leader as reiterating that "nothing 
has fundamentally changed since Aug. 2," the day Iraq invaded Kuwait. 
"The only way to have a peaceful solution is to obtain Iraq's compliance with 
United Nations Security Council demands" that Baghdad pull its troops out, free 
all foreign hostages and restore Kuwaiti sovereignty, Mitterrand said. 
King Hussein, who met Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz on Saturday, said he 
brought no message from Baghdad. Mitterrand has said his government has had no 
negotiating contacts with Iraqi leaders. 
The king stressed that a solution should also encompass the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict. He would not comment on whether Iraq should pull out of Kuwait first. 
"Obviously, we are against occupation by war. . . . We are against the 
annexation of territory," he said. 
The king, caught between neighboring Iraq and dependence on Western aid, 
reiterated that Jordan, which has an $8-billion foreign debt, is complying with 
U.N. trade sanctions despite its former heavy reliance on Iraqi oil and other 
trade.
