  [Text] Mexico City, May 31 (AFP) -- Mario Ruiz, the deputy 
attorney general of the Republic, stated this Tuesday, that drug 
trafficking in Mexico is controlled by four large groups that 
have "all the economic and technological resources to conduct 
their activities." 
  In an interview given to the Monitor newscast, the official 
admitted that the powerful Mexican traffickers have a 
"corruption mattress" among the police and they also have "ties 
with international capos." 
  The Mexican capos are the Arellano Felix brothers of the 
Tijuana cartel, Hector Palma of the Sinaloa cartel, Juan Garcia 
Abrego of the Tamaulipas cartel, and Amado Cardillo of the 
Juarez cartel, the deputy attorney general stated. 
  Ruiz, who recently gave Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
members 
a one-month ultimatum to arrest the drug chieftains, said the 
Attorney General's Office (PGR) is attempting to break the 
intermediate structures of the bands. He pointed out that, 
until the capos are arrested, the authorities will attempt to 
interrupt the flow of money and drugs to the cartel chieftains. 
  The deputy attorney general said getting to the capos is 
very 
difficult as they have a "corruption mattress" as well as "all 
the economic and technological resources to move about and even 
to leave the country and return. It is, thus, very difficult to 
search for them." However, he added, "when we arrest 
intermediate drug traffickers, they will give us information 
that will allow us to achieve bigger objectives." 
  Ruiz admitted the struggle against drug trafficking is an 
endless war but as long as the institutions and the PGR continue 
to battle they will be able to control the situation and, in 
principle, stop drug-trafficking activities from growing. 
  Last week end, Ruiz demanded that the PJF, in charge of the 
fight against drug traffickers, arrest the drug chieftains. 
Ruiz said that if the PJF does not make arrests, they will be 
charged with negligence or complicity and they will be subjected 
to justice. He explained there is evidence tying policemen with 
organized crime but he asserted that most of the PJF members are 
honest. He said the PGR is determined to get results such as a 
large quantity of drugs seized and the arrest of more drug 
traffickers.
