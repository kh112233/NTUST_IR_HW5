  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 14 (YONHAP) -- Fewer Koreans moved to 
foreign countries while more overseas Koreans came back to Korea 
last year as the country achieved further political stability 
and economic development, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday. 
  The number of Koreans emigrating to foreign countries last 
year was the lowest since 1970, only 14,477, while people 
resettling in their home country showed a steady increase with 
8,781, according to the Ministry. 
  The number of emigrants did not reach 10,000 a year until 
1969, then recorded 16,268 in 1970 and soared to 46,000 in 1976. 
  During the 1980s, 26,000-37,000 Koreans a year moved to 
foreign countries. The number of Koreans who emigrated was 
23,314 in 1990 and decreased to 17,433 in 1991 and 17,927 in 
1992. 
  People who returned to South Korea numbered about 1,000 a 
year until the early 1980s, increasing to 4,700 in 1988, 6,400 
in 1990, 7,029 in 1991 and 8,892 in 1992. 
  Those who married foreigners and moved to other countries 
totaled only 1,510 last year, compared to 6,306 in 1979, and 
those who emigrated to live with relatives in foreign countries 
amounted to 6,044. 
  An official at the Foreign Ministry attributed the drop in 
emigration to a clear improvement in living conditions and 
political democratization here.
