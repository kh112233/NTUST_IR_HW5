CYANIDE FOUND IN YOGURT EATEN BY TEEN-AGER WHO FELL CRITICALLY ILL 
Cyanide has been found in a container of yogurt eaten by a teen-ager who became 
critically ill Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported. 
Laboratory tests by the FDA confirmed the presence of cyanide and federal 
officials informed the state Health Department. 
The victim, Thomas Lee, 17, of Haddonfield, was in critical condition at West 
Jersey Hospital's Eastern Division in Voorhees, said George Kerns, a spokesman 
for Camden County prosecutor Samuel Asbell. 
The cyanide, a rat poison, was found in an 8-ounce container of Breyer's black 
cherry yogurt with the code date Feb. 9, 1989. Officials say the yogurt was 
purchased from either the Haddonfield or Westmont Acme supermarkets. 
Acme has removed all yogurt from five Camden County stores and Breyer's yogurt 
products from all of its stores, the Health Department said. 
Kraft Inc. Dairy Group, based in Philadelphia, is withdrawing all flavors of 
Breyer's yogurt from retail stores in the Delaware Valley because of suspected 
tampering. 
The Dairy Group announced Tuesday night that it is cooperating with the FDA, 
local law enforcement and public health authorities in the investigation of the 
incident, which is believed to be an isolated product tampering. There have 
been no other reports of illness. 
The company said Breyer's yogurt packages have a tamper-evident seal.
