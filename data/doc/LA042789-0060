Rioters have stabbed, stoned or clubbed to death at least 40 people and wounded 
nearly 700 in two days of attacks against Senegalese living in the Mauritanian 
capital of Nouakchott, hospital sources said. Troops were on patrol in the city 
and in Dakar, capital of neighboring Senegal, where Mauritanian traders and 
shops have been attacked. There was no reliable word on the number of 
casualties outside Nouakchott. Both governments appealed for calm and began 
repatriating victims who wanted to leave. The violence in the two countries on 
the edge of the Sahara was sparked by competing claims to farming areas on an 
island in the Senegal River, which forms the border between the two western 
Africa nations. The dispute flared into violence on April 9.
