British military authorities have a lovely dilemma for anyone who fought in
the Gulf War and now believes he is suffering because of the drugs
prescribed as a supposed defence against possible chemical attack by Saddam
Hussein. They just pop it all under the Official Secrets Act and prevent you
finding out anything. The Americans have acknowledged the existence of 'Gulf
War Syndrome' which entails damage to the auto-immune or nervous systems,
and have agreed to compensate victims, but the British are refusing to
accept that any such condition exists. Critical Eye has a second go at
investigating (9.00 C4). You do not often hear anyone say 'Serves them
right, the greedy pigs' about the Lloyds names who are losing everything in
the great insurance crash, yet the phrase hovers unspoken. However, to most
of us these people are faceless, so Inside Story sets out to meet some of
them (10.00 BBC1). In the opening episode of ITV's new soap, Revelations, we
had the bishop's new daughter-in-law in lacy basque and stockings, and
enthusiastic rumpy-pumpy on the bonnet of a car, so you can see why they are
transmitting it at 10.40.
