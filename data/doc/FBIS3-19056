<F P=106> [Javier R. Ventosa report: "Spain Rejected German Leopard </F>
Tank Purchase Offer"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The German authorities recently offered a 
consignment of Leopard tanks to Spain, which did not even 
consider the offer, believing that its stock is already 
sufficient, according to Defense Ministry sources. 
  The informal offer was made during the Spanish-German summit 
held in Granada at the end of November, in which the two 
countries' defense ministers took part, meeting again in Bonn a 
few weeks later. 
<H5>  Almost Free of Charge </H5>
  Although specific details of the offer have not leaked out, 
it apparently involved several dozen Leopard-1 tanks -- some 
circles speak of 300 -- which were to be destroyed or withdrawn 
from Germany as a result of the conventional disarmament treaty, 
which limits the tanks of all European countries. The terms for 
their sale were virtually free of charge. 
  The Spanish Army had been keenly interested for some time in 
Leopard tanks in order to renew its aged armored vehicle stock, 
although the Defense Ministry sources consulted stated that the 
latest German offer "came too late," since Spain has already 
renewed its stock since 1993 with the arrival of 300 U.S. M60 
tanks. 
  Moreover, receiving German technology would necessitate 
changing the Spanish Army's maintenance and logistic systems, 
which are geared to the U.S. equipment. In this connection, 
reliable sources state that the German offer's ultimate aim 
could have been a commercial motive; the creation of a "captive 
market" in Spain which would necessitate purchasing all the 
spare parts in Germany. 
  Since 1992, Spain's armored vehicle stock has undergone a 
transformation as a result of the implementation of the 
conventional disarmament treaty. Spain had 854 tanks (375 
M47's, 180 M48's, and 299 AMX-30's), and the conventional 
disarmament treaty set the Spanish Army a ceiling of 794 tanks, 
so it had to destroy just 60 in order not to exceed that limit. 
The decision to accept 420 surplus U.S. tanks in Europe raised 
Spain's stock to 1,264, with the consequent need to destroy 480. 
  The Army later discarded 110 of the 420 M60's, although it 
still needed to destroy the 480 surplus tanks, so Spain's 
armored vehicle stock was finally put at 684 tanks (310 M60's, 
already received, 164 M48's, and 210 AMX-30's), with the 
possibility of increasing it by 110, to reach the ceiling set by 
the conventional disarmament treaty. 
  Out of the 480 tanks to be destroyed or disabled, the 
Spanish 
Army has now discarded 120 tanks between September and November 
1993. The other 360 -- mostly ancient M47's -- are to be 
disabled before November 1995.
