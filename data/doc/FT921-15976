FT  07 JAN 92 / Savimbi deplores killings
ANGOLAN opposition leader Jonas Savimbi said yesterday his former rebels
were not responsible for the deaths of four British travellers killed in an
ambush, Reuter reports from Abidjan.
However, Mr Savimbi, head of the Unita movement, also said at a press
conference in the Ivory Coast that while he deplored the killing of
tourists, he did not think it was wise for foreigners to travel in a country
which had just ended a civil war. He blamed robbers for the attack, near a
base where thousands of former Unita rebels are confined.
