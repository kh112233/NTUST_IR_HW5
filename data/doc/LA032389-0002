1990 CENSUS HOLDS PROMISE FOR LATINO POLITICAL ACTIVISTS 
Leo Estrada recalls the pitched battles of the 1970s between a band of Latino 
activists and the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Back then, Estrada, who was a college professor from Texas, and his Latino 
allies inside and outside government, had a difficult time convincing East 
Coast officials "that we existed," he recalled. Estrada, a demographer, knew 
what was at stake, and he took it upon himself to persuade Latino leaders 
across the country to push for an accurate count. 
The decade-long effort paid off: The 1980 census was the best count ever of 
Latinos. It recorded a 61% population explosion nationwide, including an even 
more dramatic 87% increase in California. 
America discovered Latinos. The media touted "The Decade of the Hispanic." And 
the phrase "numbers are on our side" became a slogan among Latino activists. 
Census-based reapportionment of congressional, state and local districts is 
credited with a doubling of Latinos in Congress and the election of hundreds of 
Latino officials across the country. Because the distribution of billions of 
dollars in federal funds is also based on the census, cities and states with 
large Latino populations received additional money. 
The 1990 census holds even greater promise for Latinos, according to Estrada, 
now a renowned UCLA demographer and chairman of the Hispanic advisory committee 
of the U.S. Census Bureau. 
"The 1980 census gave us a visibility we never had before on a national level," 
said Estrada. But today, he added, Latinos are better prepared to make the 
census numbers count, "to move from bragging about our growth to understanding 
how to use the numbers to improve conditions for ourselves." 
Already, with census day -- April 1, 1990 -- still a year away, Latino 
organizations have begun gearing up for the decennial count and to monitor the 
reapportionment that will follow. They are also keeping a close watch on two 
lawsuits against the Census Bureau that pit the interests of states with large 
minority and immigrant populations, like California and New York, against 
states that have neither. 
The 1990 census is expected to show an increase over the decade of more than 5 
million Latinos nationwide, for a total of nearly 20 million. About 1.3 million 
of that increase is expected to occur in Los Angeles County, where Latinos are 
projected to become one-third of the population. In California, Latinos are 
projected to reach 7 million, or about one-fourth of the population. 
Estrada said he also expects the census to show unprecedented changes in the 
composition and distribution of Latinos. For the first time, it will provide a 
complete breakdown by country of origin. In 1980, Central and South Americans 
were lumped into a category of "other" Latinos. 
The census will also measure whether income and education levels have improved. 
And it will reveal a lot about the "shadow" population of 3 million illegal 
immigrants who applied for amnesty under the 1986 Immigration Reform Act. 
According to census estimates, about half the growth among Latinos is 
attributable to immigration. 
Census officials say they are gearing up for their most intensive effort at 
counting hard-to-reach segments. Despite dramatic improvement in the 1980 
census, the bureau estimates that it still missed 7% of Latinos, compared to 1% 
of the general population. 
The Census Bureau is devoting "more staff, money and resources" to reaching 
minorities than it did in 1980, said Jose Bermea, who is coordinating the 
Census Bureau's Latino promotion campaign. 
A focus of the promotional campaigns, scheduled to begin in late spring, will 
be to encourage hard-to-reach illegal immigrants to be counted. The appeal to 
illegal immigrants will stress the census' strict confidentiality, Bermea said. 
Census questionnaires will be available in Spanish, upon request, as will 
Spanish-speaking operators and census takers for those who need assistance. 
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) is launching 
its own media campaign this spring across California, parts of the Midwest and 
possibly Texas. The campaign will focus on the hardest Latinos to reach -- 
illegal immigrants, day laborers, the homeless, those living in garages or 
doubled up in apartments. 
The challenge will be greater this time, said the campaign's director, Arturo 
Vargas, because the numbers of the poor and the homeless are greater. 
Concern among cities and states that stand to lose most from an under-count of 
minorities and poor led to the suit demanding that the Census Bureau correct 
the anticipated under-count with a follow-up survey. Besides Los Angeles and 
California, other plaintiffs include the city and state of New York, Chicago 
and Dade County, Fla., as well as Latino and black organizations. 
The Census Bureau argued that there is not enough time to conduct the 
additional survey and meet its deadline of delivering the census to the 
President on Dec. 31, 1990. 
In the other case, an anti-immigration organization, 41 congressmen and three 
states without sizable immigrant populations are demanding that illegal 
immigrants be excluded from the count for reapportionment. The organization, 
the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), filed a similar suit 10 
years ago, but without congressional backing. It lost on a legal technicality. 
Plaintiffs in both cases agree that timing is crucial if either of the court 
rulings are to be implemented in time for the 1990 census. 
Whatever the cases' outcome, Latino organizations say they are preparing for 
the count and preparing early. 
"Over the next two years, we're going to be setting our political potential for 
the next decade in concrete," said Andrew Hernandez, president of the Southwest 
Voter Registration and Education Project. The organization has begun training 
groups in 150 communities nationwide to monitor redistricting, which begins in 
1991, Hernandez said. 
"The monitoring groups will ensure that redistricting plans brought forward at 
the local level are fair to Latino voters," he said. Historically, he noted, 
political districts have been gerrymandered at the expense of Latinos. This has 
been particularly "atrocious" in California, he added, where the proportion of 
Latinos elected to office is substantially smaller than in other southwestern 
states. 
A Justice Department lawsuit filed in September charges that the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors has gerrymandered supervisorial districts to 
prevent the election of a Latino. The board -- five white men representing one 
of the largest Latino constituencies in the nation -- has vowed to fight the 
discrimination suit. They have argued that redistricting should wait until 1991 
when new census numbers are routinely used to redistrict anyway. 
But Latino advocates counter that two supervisorial elections are scheduled 
before then and should be conducted with corrected district lines. 
California's Latino Population Growth 
The Latino population in California is projected to reach approximately seven 
million in the 1990 Census, one-fourth of the state's total. The number of 
Latinos, which grew steadily in the early 20th Century, rose dramatically in 
the 1950s, '60s and '70s, with a population nearly doubling each decade.
