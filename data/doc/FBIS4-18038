Study of Public Opinion on Social and Economic Questions: 
"Today Russians Would Vote Differently to 12 December"] 
  [Text] As the date of the elections to the Federal 
Assembly recedes, the discrepancy between the actual deeds of 
the various blocs and parties represented in the State Duma and 
the promises which they lavished during the election campaign is 
becoming increasingly obvious. 
  In order to measure trust in the political blocs and 
parties, 
the following question was posed during an opinion poll 
conducted recently by the All-Russia Center for the Study of 
Public Opinion among approximately 4,000 Russians from a 
representative sample of the adult population of the Russian 
Federation. If elections to parliament were held next Sunday, 
for which bloc or party would you vote in these elections? The 
answers to this question were distributed (in percentages) as 
follows:

  The Communists and Agrarians had the most stable supporters 
in this poll. Relatively less stability is shown by the 
advocates of Zhirinovskiy's party (57 percent) and the "Russia's 
Choice" (55 percent) and "Yabloko" (52 percent) blocs. The 
supporters of Travkin's party (44 percent) and the "Women of 
Russia" political bloc (35 percent) showed the least constancy.
