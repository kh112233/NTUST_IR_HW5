FT  13 APR 92 / Winnie Mandela in fresh row over beating
A CO-DEFENDANT in last year's kidnap and assault trial of Mrs Winnie
Mandela, wife of the African National Congress leader, Mr Nelson Mandela,
has told a Johannesburg newspaper that he was present when Mrs Mandela beat
four young men in her Soweto home, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg.
The claims, published in the Johannesburg Sunday Times, will heighten
controversy surrounding the role of Mrs Mandela in the 1988 beatings. They
follow allegations made a fortnight ago that Mrs Mandela ordered the murder
of a prominent doctor who would have been a key figure in the case. In light
of those claims, police are re-examining the doctor's death, which had been
treated as a robbery-related murder.
The charges are an embarrassment to the ANC, in which Mrs Mandela holds
senior positions. However, her influence in the organisation has declined
sharply since the trial and she is seldom seen in public with her husband,
leading to speculation that they will soon become legally separated.
Mr John Morgan, Mrs Mandela's former driver, told the Sunday Times that he
lied in court to protect her during last year's trial. Mrs Mandela was
convicted as an accessory after the fact to assault and given a one-year
prison sentence, as well as a five-year sentence for planning the kidnapping
of the boys. The case is subject to appeal.
The judge failed to find Mrs Mandela guilty of assault because he accepted
her alibi that she was not present when the boys were beaten - which Mr
Morgan now disputes.
One of the four victims of the beatings later died, and Mr Morgan told the
newspaper that Mrs Mandela ordered him to remove the corpse from the house.
'I was told by Winnie to pick up the dog and dump him,' it quoted Mr Morgan
as saying.
Mr Morgan received a one-year suspended sentence during the trial.
