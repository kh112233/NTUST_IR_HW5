INMATES TAKEN OFF DOG TRAINING 
The practice of inmates wrestling and fighting with tracking dogs at the end of 
training exercises was temporarily halted today by the state prison board. 
Members of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice unanimously approved the 
recommendations of a board subcommittee that the "contact" practice be 
suspended until inmates have more protective gear and policies are in place to 
ensure that only volunteers are used for the exercise. 
Until now, an inmate would be given a head start and go into hiding or climb a 
tree, and then, when the inmate was located by the dog, he would briefly fight 
with the animal. 
The dog training came under fire after board Vice Chairman Jerry Hodge took two 
companions on an inmate hunt for sport. Hodge later had jackets made for them 
that dubbed the trip "The Ultimate Hunt." He has since apologized for the 
jackets.
