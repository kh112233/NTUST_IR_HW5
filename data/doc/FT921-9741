FT  11 FEB 92 / Crackdown on Basque party
Spain's attorney-general yesterday ordered the immediate arrest of three
radical Basque politicians accused of aiding and abetting terrorism, his
office said, AP reports from Madrid.
The action came only a few hours after suspected Basque separatists set off
a car bomb in Murica that killed a policeman who became the 11th victim of
political violence in Spain this year. Mr Leopoldo Torres filed the suit
against Jon Cruz Idigoras, a deputy in the lower house of the Spanish
parliament for the radical Basque party, Herri Batasuna (HB), Floren Aoiz,
deputy for HB in the regional parliament of Navarre and Patxi Zabaleta, a
member of HB's national executive committee.
