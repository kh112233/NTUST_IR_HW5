FT  18 NOV 92 / Argentina acts to stabilise the peso
ARGENTINA plans to take currency convertibility a step further in response
to last week's speculation, which drove the peso below parity with the US
dollar, by allowing banks and individuals to broaden hard currency holdings.
The central bank president, Mr Roque Fernandez, announced on Monday evening
that individuals could open dollar current accounts and banks could meet
central bank reserve requirements in pesos or dollars. However, wages and
taxes would still be paid in pesos.
The hope is that this will strengthen confidence in the peso and encourage a
decline in interest rates - which reached 100 per cent a year, in dollar
terms, on the interbank market on Monday. Yesterday, interest rates settled
down to 35-40 per cent, while share prices climbed 7 per cent and the peso
rose above its maximum official rate of one peso to the dollar.
The government formally pegged the peso to the dollar in April 1991, when it
made the currency fully convertible and required central bank reserves to
equal the money supply. However, confidence in the peso is ebbing, as
inflation continues rising at about 20 per cent a year, making the currency
increasingly overvalued.
Observers say Mr Fernandez's proposal - originally floated last year - is
largely psychological. The US dollar is already a de facto parallel
currency. One US analyst said: 'A lot of inflation comes from expectations
that there will eventually be a devaluation. If they were really serious,
they would abolish the peso. By keeping it, they are keeping open the option
to print money or devalue.'
However, bankers commented that other factors such as seasonally tight
liquidity, the likelihood that privatisations due for December will be less
lucrative than expected, and continuing political risk, will keep interest
rates high.
