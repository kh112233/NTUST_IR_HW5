  The Economic Ministry accepted the proposal on 
enhancing the competitive ability of business ventures formed 
around the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, with specialists at 
the ministry expected to participate in the program. 
  "Cooperation between the domestic and national programs of 
developing economic policy has started to grow rapidly," said 
Karl Arusoo, economic advisor at the Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry. 
  While the Economic Ministry concentrates on charting the 
development of macro-economics, the goal of the program created 
at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry is to help with the 
development of business in a more limited context, Arusoo said. 
  Peeter Tohver, deputy chancellor at the Economic Ministry, 
said that the ministry's work group on economic policy 
cooperates with all groupings, institutions and organizations 
involved in this area. 
  The macro policy-makers at the Economic Ministry do not 
identify themselves as a specific grouping, institute or 
scientific body but try, on their own, to stimulate activity 
toward economic development. 
  "We want to see a social need emerge for developing economic 
policy," Tohver added. "The current program to enhance the 
ability to compete is quite extensive, indeed, but it is hard to 
determine just what it entails." 
  The proposal for enhancing the ability to compete is 
designed 
to solve problems for the clientele of the Estonian Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry, EVEA [Estonian Small Business 
Association], REEL [Alliance of State Enterprise Managers], and 
the Central Alliance of Industry. The proposal was signed by 17 
institutions.

  "Current research indicates that businesses do not perceive 
any governmental support to their activity," Arusoo said. "The 
program for enhancing the ability to compete is designed to help 
solve the problems of many of the businesses." 
  Todate, according to Arusoo, support systems have been 
created to implement the program. The plans of action, projected 
dates of completion and a listing of necessary resources for the 
program have also been submitted to the Economic Ministry 
recently. 
  The businesses, he added, are at this time concerned 
primarily with problems related to training, financing, credit 
and legislation. 
  The moving force behind the proposal for enhancing the 
ability to compete is a group of senior experts, representing 
expertise in production, privatization, industry, export, 
standards and design. The two supporting beams of the proposal 
are the development of a credit system for business enterprises, 
and the creation of a training system. 
  Up until now, Arusoo said, Estonia lacks a comprehensive 
system for economic education, the development of which should 
be started through business advice centers in the districts. 
  "Economic education should be a continuous process, not 
training by injection," he added. "Enhancing the ability to 
compete should start with changing the entrepreneurs' way of 
thinking and with training programs."
