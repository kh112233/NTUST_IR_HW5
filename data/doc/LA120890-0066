7 WHO WERE SENTENCED TO RECORD MOLESTATION TERMS ARE FREED 
Defendants in a child molestation case that produced the longest sentences in 
state history have been freed because of appellate rulings that their 
convictions were improper. 
One of the last to leave prison was Ricky Lynn Pitts, who was greeted by his 
wife and teen-age daughters when he was set free Friday. 
"No words can describe the happiness I'm feeling," Pitts said. "it's unreal. 
Six and one-half years in prison and having your girls taken away for something 
you didn't do -- it's unbelievable." 
Pitts' wife, Marcella, was released Wednesday. They and five other defendants 
had been serving prison sentences of 285 to 405 years on a total of 377 counts. 
The Pitts case was one of the most sensational of several multi-defendant Kern 
County child molestation cases in the early 1980s. They led to a state attorney 
general's report criticizing the methods of investigators, especially for 
asking children leading questions.
