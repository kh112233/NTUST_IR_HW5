  [Abstract] The work reported here is based on the 
assumption of dynamic domain organization of receptor molecules 
in biological membranes. According to that concept, the receptor 
molecules are structural elements of the cyclic process of the 
formation and decay of receptor domains, and they catalyze 
biochemical cell transformations, transport substances across 
membrane barriers, and generate cyclic electrical and 
biochemical changes. Cyclomononucleotides and inositol 
triphosphate operate as biochemical modulators of ion-channel 
permeability by blocking Ca- binding centers of gate mechanisms 
of receptor-domain ion channels, thereby mobilizing 
Ca[.sup]2+[/] ions in the cell from intracellular calcium 
depots and from the surrounding medium. Kinetic diagrams of the 
operation of the gate mechanisms are provided for instances in 
which ions or molecules capable of blocking just one Ca-binding 
center are present along with the Ca[.sup]2+[/] ions. Figures
