PETE WILSON IN SACRAMENTO 
Now that what used to be called voter apathy has been established to be 
frustration at the lack of choices between the major party candidates, it is 
high time that the media begin paying attention to the minor parties. These 
parties actually have divergent political philosophies that may appeal to many 
nonvoters who probably do not even know they exist. 
In attempting to rationalize the decision of the media (with the exception of 
some talk radio stations) to perpetuate the myth of the two-party system, I 
imagine that journalists feel these parties are not newsworthy because they 
receive few votes. However, the reverse is also true, as few people will vote 
for parties that they know nothing about. 
This is not to imply that The Times or other papers should endorse these 
candidates; only that they should acknowledge their existence. Feinstein was 
not, as The Times stated, the first female gubernatorial candidate in 
California, or one of only five female candidates on the ballot. She was the 
first major party female candidate, and one of five major party candidates.
