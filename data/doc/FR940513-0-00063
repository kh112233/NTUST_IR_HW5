SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 3, 1993 (58 FR 63995), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 3A4403) had been filed by H&uuml;ls
America, Inc., Turner Pl., P.O. Box 365, Piscataway, NJ 088550365. The petition proposed that the food additive
regulations in 172.811 

Glyceryl tristearate

 (21 CFR 172.811) be amended to broaden the specifications for the acid number, saponification number, and melting
point for glyceryl tristearate. 


 FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that glyceryl tristearate
conforming to the specifications requested by the petitioner is safe, and that the food additive regulations should
be amended as set forth below. 
 In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection. 
 The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(9) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
 Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before June 13, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
