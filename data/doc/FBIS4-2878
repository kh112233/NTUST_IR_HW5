  [Text] The Ministry of Communications recently issued an 
emergency circular on strengthening control over safety during 
springtime. The circular bans lake or river cruises during 
springtime by boats and ships without a certificate of registry 
or an operating license. Units that solicit tourists and use 
boats, as well as boatmen and shipowners shall be held 
responsible if an accident occurs due to their failure to comply 
with this requirement. Boats and ships that take passengers on 
a spring cruise must strictly comply with the regulations on the 
maximum capacity of passengers permitted on board, and must be 
equipped with standard lifesaving appliances as well as standard 
fire fighting facilities. 
  The circular requires departments responsible for 
transportation, and harbor navigation superintendency 
administrations at all levels to conduct widespread propaganda 
of the laws and regulations on surface transportation safety. 
As regards boats and ships that take passengers on spring 
cruises in violation of regulations, harbor navigation 
superintendency administrations are required to sternly punish 
boatmen, shipowners, and the crew responsible for such 
violations according to the law.
