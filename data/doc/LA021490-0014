MAN SOUGHT AFTER FIRING AT OFFICERS 
Police using search dogs and a helicopter scoured a rugged area in the Santa 
Susana Pass near Chatsworth Tuesday evening looking for a man suspected of 
shooting at two Oxnard police officers, authorities said. 
The officers were not injured when Mark M. Richendollar, 32, allegedly fired at 
them with a police service revolver he pulled from the holster of one of the 
officers during a scuffle in an Oxnard apartment complex about 5:45 p.m. 
Tuesday, Oxnard Police Sgt. Denny Phillips said. 
Richendollar tried to shoot again but the gun failed to fire, Phillips said. 
Richendollar drove off in a nearby car. 
Phillips said the officers had gone to the apartment complex at Charles and 
Clara streets to arrest Richendollar on an assault warrant. The officers 
wrestled the gun from him before he started running, Phillips said. 
About an hour later, a California Highway Patrol officer pulled over a car 
registered to Richendollar near the Topanga Canyon Boulevard off-ramp of the 
Simi Valley Freeway, Los Angeles police Lt. Frank Malan said. The driver, 
believed by police to be armed with a pistol and a large knife, fled into thick 
brush next to the freeway, Malan said. 
Malan said winds up to 50 m.p.h. made it difficult for police dogs to track the 
man's scent. 
Phillips said Richendollar had been staying with his girlfriend at the Oxnard 
apartment, but police did not know how long he had been living there.
