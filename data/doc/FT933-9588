FT  09 AUG 93 / Observer: Up the Pole?
If the choice of the next president of the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development was in the gift of newspaper leader writers, then
46-year-old Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister, would
already have the job. First the New York Times and now The Economist have
come out strongly in favour of the man credited with knocking the Polish
economy into shape.
Given that Balcerowicz served less than three years in the political
frontline as Poland's finance minister, he may lack some political savvy
and, on paper at least, his management skills look no better than those of
the EBRD's ex-boss, Jacques Attali. That said, for a man with no obvious
public relations skills, Balcerowicz seems to be doing a jolly good job
getting his message across.
