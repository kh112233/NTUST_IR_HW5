  [Text] Horne Srnie--Disagreement with the proposal put 
forward by Slovak Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna at talks with 
Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml in Piestany on 14 January, 
under which the Slovak part of the community of Horne 
Srnie-Sidonia is to be annexed to the Czech Republic, was voiced 
by the Horne Srnie local council at its meeting the day before 
yesterday. In a statement addressed to Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar, the Horne Srnie deputies demand that the present border 
between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic [CR], which 
is formed here by the Vlarka Creek, be retained. They appeal to 
National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies to endorse 
their demand that the present border remain unchanged.
