  [Abstract] The increasing stringency of the requirements 
imposed on the economic and environmental indicators of aircraft 
gas turbine engines (AGTD) brought to the forefront the issue of 
using liquefied hydrogen or natural gas as motor fuel which 
calls for preliminary fuel gasification in a special heat 
exchanger. The development of such heat exchangers-gasifiers is 
fraught with a number of problems, e.g., selecting the heat 
exchanger location, ensuring a stable cryogenic fuel flow in the 
heat exchanger channels, selecting the fuel preheating regime, 
etc. The solution to these problems is complicated by a lack of 
reliable design methods. To bridge this gap, an attempt is made 
to develop an analysis technique using the example of heat 
exchanger-gasifiers for NK-88 and NK-89 engines. The design of 
the heat exchanger and heat and mass transfer processes during 
cryogenic fuel gasification are described in detail, a 
mathematical model of the process is formulated, and an 
algorithm for solving the resulting equations is proposed. The 
analytical method of designing heat exchangers for cryogenic 
fuel gasification with two-phase flow conditions inside the 
pipes and frosting on the outside surface is verified 
experimentally. The maximum spread between the analytical and 
experimental data is within 15-25% which attests to the 
mathematical model's adequacy for practical applications.
