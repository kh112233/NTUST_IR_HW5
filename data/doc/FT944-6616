FT  29 NOV 94 / Railtrack blamed for train delays
One of the newly created train operating companies has accused Railtrack of
providing such a poor service that it has been unable to run its advertised
timetables.
North London Railways said it had held talks with the East Anglia zone of
Railtrack, owner of the track, signals and stations, to discuss urgently
needed infrastructure improvements.
Mr Chris Gibbard, retail manager of North London, said in a letter to Mr
John Sanderson, secretary of the North London Line passengers' committee:
'We have all been as frustrated as yourself and all our customers at
Railtrack's apparent inability to manage the route.'
A North London director had 'arranged high level talks with Railtrack East
Anglia Management to insist upon an improvement in infrastructure management
to enable North London Railways to run its advertised service'.
Details of Mr Gibbard's comments were made public by Ms Glenda Jackson,
Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate.
Railtrack East Anglia said the North London lines had been neglected before
it took them over from British Rail on April 1. It said: 'We inherited old
infrastructure which needed improvement.'
Railtrack added that plans to upgrade the line to allow the Channel tunnel
Eurostar trains to get to the north of England had been delayed but were
expected to be carried out next year. These improvements would also benefit
local train services.
London Underground will today unveil plans for a Pounds 70m 1 1/4 -mile
extension of the Piccadilly line to the proposed fifth terminal at Heathrow
airport.
If the plans are approved work could start in 1997 and the new extension and
station would become operational in the year 2002, when Terminal 5 is due to
open.
