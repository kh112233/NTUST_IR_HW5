STOLEN CAR CHASE ENDS IN NEWHALL 
Two men in a stolen car were arrested this morning in Newhall after a chase on 
the Golden State Freeway that reached speeds of 125 m.p.h., the California 
Highway Patrol said. 
Michael Yanacek, 21, and Michael Distefano, 22, both of Hollywood, were 
captured about 2:30 a.m. when the stolen Acura Legend that Yanacek was driving 
was struck by a CHP car on San Fernando Road near 4th Street, officers said. No 
one was injured. The two were arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto, the 
CHP said. 
The chase began when Los Angeles police spotted the stolen car on Vineland 
Avenue. When officers attempted to pull it over, the car sped away and entered 
the Golden State Freeway and headed north. 
The CHP took over the chase, and officers said the car reached a speed of 125 
m.p.h. before exiting the freeway at Lyons Road. The car sped on surface 
streets at 100 m.p.h. before crashing through a construction barrier on San 
Fernando Road and slowing in an unpaved area, the CHP said. A CHP car 
broadsided the stolen car when it attempted to turn north in the southbound 
lanes, according to CHP reports.
