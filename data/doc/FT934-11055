FT  02 NOV 93 / Midlands freight depot proposed
ABBCOTT Estates, a private property company half-owned by Severn Trent
Water, yesterday asked Daventry District Council for planning permission to
build a rail freight terminal with 2.3m sq ft of associated manufacturing
and distribution floorspace.
The move emphasises the search for land in the Midlands to develop
distribution depots close to the M1, M6 and M42 motorways. It reflects the
assumption that rail freight traffic will increase after the Channel tunnel
opens next year.
The Abbcott scheme, covering 160 acres five miles south of the M1/M6
interchange, would cost Pounds 140m to complete, but the terminal could
start operations after an investment of Pounds 35m on infrastructure.
The Daventry terminal could open in November 1995, depending on planning
procedures. It is then likely to be in competition with the terminal at
Landor Street, Birmingham, operated and recently expanded by Railfreight
Distribution, a British Rail subsidiary.
