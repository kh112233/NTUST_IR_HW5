  [Text] New Delhi, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- Addressing the 
International Children's Health Conference sponsored by the 
World Health Organization here today, Chinese Public Health 
Minister Chen Minzhang said that China reached its target of 
immunizing 85 percent of the children in provinces and counties 
in 1988 and 1990 respectively; now China has placed on its 
agenda the project of immunizing 85 percent of the children in 
townships and annihilating polio by the year 1995. He said 
China is also creating conditions so that immunization against 
hepatitis B can gradually be brought into plan. 
  The three-day meeting will close on 4 February. The 
representatives attending the meeting have exchanged views on 
the progress the world has made in achieving the intermediate 
objectives set for children's development during the 1990's, and 
they will also study and discuss the strategies and measures for 
achieving those objectives faster. 
  Chen Minzhang noted: A populous developing country, China 
has one-fifth of the world's children, and more than 20 million 
babies are born in China each year. Because the level of 
China's economic development remains low and its economic 
foundation is weak, children's health services and actual needs 
in China are still quite far behind the intermediate objectives 
set for the 1990's. China will continue to contribute its share 
to the global objectives by accelerating the process of 
achieving the objectives set for the 1990's.
