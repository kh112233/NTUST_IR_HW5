FT  02 OCT 92 / Technology: Herbicide doubles as a potential cure  - Worth
Watching
ICI, the UK chemicals group, likes to talk about the synergy between its
research into pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. A specific example of that
is published in today's Lancet, Clive Cookson writes.
NTBC, a compound originally invented as a potential herbicide at the
company's US agrochemicals research centre in California, turns out to be a
valuable drug for treating children with type I tyrosinaemia, an inherited
metabolic disorder.
The link was discovered during safety testing at ICI's central toxicology
laboratory in the UK. This showed that NTBC affected the metabolism of the
amino acid tyrosine.
A collaborative clinical study with Gothenburg University in Sweden has
confirmed that NTBC can prevent the build-up of toxic metabolic by-products
in tyrosinaemia. About one child in 100,000 is born with the disease - and
most die before they reach adolescence. ICI Central Toxicology Lab: UK, 0625
