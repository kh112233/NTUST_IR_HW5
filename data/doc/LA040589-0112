TODAY'S QUOTE 
"The bomb was built to kill and he had the bomb, so we felt that if the 
officers made a mistake, it just wasn't important." 
 -- Unnamed juror in the trial of makeup artist Donald Lee Morse, convicted of 
murder in the deaths of two police officers killed while dismantling a pipe 
bomb in Morse's basement. Although the trial judge disallowed defense arguments 
that the officers caused their own deaths by carelessness, jurors said they 
heard enough hints to know what the defense lawyers were getting at.
