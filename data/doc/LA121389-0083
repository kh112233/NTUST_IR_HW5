ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
5 ARTWORKS FAIL TO GET MINIMUM BIDS 
The Internal Revenue Service on Tuesday failed to get the minimum $10,500 it 
sought for five artworks said to be creations of Salvador Dali at a public 
auction and will try to sell the pieces again next spring, officials said. 
When the artworks were offered separately for bids, the total of the five 
highest bids was only $4,540. Of the estimated 50 people who attended the 
auction, several expressed concern that the works might be fakes and were 
hesitant to offer higher bids, spokeswoman Sally Ruhnau said. 
The artworks, along with several parcels of real estate, were seized for 
nonpayment of taxes. The five pieces consisted of two identical 1976 
tapestries, "Lincoln in Dalivision"; a wood engraving, "Divine Comedy -- The 
Misers" from 1963; and two hand-colored etchings from the "Astrology Series, 
"Aries" and "Leo," both from 1984. 
The IRS had the pieces appraised by Richard G. Ruskin of Ruskin Fine Arts of 
Los Angeles. He listed the fair-market value of each tapestry at $5,700. He 
appraised the wood engraving at $420, and the etchings at $240 each. 
But the highest bid at the auction for either tapestry was $2,050, and "The 
Misers" drew a bid of only $300. Those bids came from Clay Baxter of Yorba 
Linda, who said he did not believe that the IRS would sell forged items. THUAN
