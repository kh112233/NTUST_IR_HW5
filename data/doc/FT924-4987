FT  28 NOV 92 / Property: Sellers get a painful lesson - Instead of house
prices in Kent getting a boost from the Channel Tunnel, they're back to the
levels of 1986/87
FALLING house prices are a tender subject in Kent, despite the ever-nearer
advent of the Channel tunnel. It had been expected the Chunnel would boost
prices but this has not happened so far. Indeed, they are back to their
pre-boom level of 1986/87, which is roughly half what they were only two
years ago. That has been a painful lesson for sellers.
Richard Page, of Savills in Sevenoaks, cites two examples. Meopham Bank, a
Regency house near Tonbridge offered at Pounds 1.25m in the spring of 1990,
has just been sold for Pounds 550,000. Pilgrim House at Trottiscliffe, which
was sold in 1987 for Pounds 500,000, was re-sold recently at the same
figure.
Then there is Wardes, a nine-bedroom, Grade I-listed medieval hall/house in
four acres in the conservation village of Otham, near Maidstone. It is the
finest of several timber-framed houses in Otham and was restored in 1912 by
Sir Louis Mallet, the diplomat. There is a mural in the living room of a
stag being stalked by a hunter and a panther. It was painted by an
architect, Philip Tilden, to represent 'the unsuspecting income tax-payer
assailed on all sides.'
It now needs further restoration and modernisation. Wardes failed this
summer to attract a buyer for Pounds 450,000 and the house is being offered
by tender - closing on December 15 - at a guide price of Pounds 250,000. The
agent is Knight Frank &amp; Rutley at Tunbridge Wells (0892-515-035).
Having sold the Grange, a rundown, Grade II-listed 17th century house on the
edge of Goudhurst (which just failed to reach its guide price of Pounds
250,000), KF&amp;R's Robin Tillett is confident Wardes will find a buyer. 'We
are having considerable success in selling rundown properties at formal
tender,' he says. 'This will be the fifth since August. I believe going to
tender concentrates people's minds, and rundown houses inspire the
imagination.'
Meanwhile, the recent sale of another notable property at Otham provides
further evidence of the fall in prices. The 15-bedroomed Gore Court House,
set in 20 acres and listed grade II, came to market in June 1990 at Pounds
750,000. By the summer of 1991, the price had drifted down to Pounds
450,000. Two months ago, the property was sold at auction by Cluttons for
Pounds 317,500.
Nearly 18 months ago, I reported that the owners of the 428-acre Henden
Manor estate at Ide Hill, near Sevenoaks, had dropped the asking price of
their beautiful 16th century house from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3m because they
'now have a very real desire to sell.' That desire has assumed even more
urgency: the price has been reduced to Pounds 2m through Savills
(0732-455-551) and KF&amp;R.
Savills also is selling the home of journalist Jean Rook, who died last
year. South Riding, a six-bedroom country house in seven acres south of
Edenbridge is priced at Pounds 325,000. Howard Cundey (0342-833-333) is
joint agent.
'Prices have to be extremely sensible and realistic to achieve a sale,' says
Anthony Brooks, director of GA Town &amp; Country at Tunbridge Wells
(0892-542-711). 'People don't want to listen when we say that properties are
selling at 1987 prices - or even 1986 prices.'
He cites Sissinghurst Park, a Grade II-listed Edwardian house in 20 acres of
gardens not far from the better-known gardens at Sissinghurst Castle. It was
offered at Pounds 1.2m in April 1991 but now can be had for Pounds 650,000.
Brooks has just completed the sale of the six-bedroom Woodsden Farmhouse in
two acres near Hawkhurst for more than Pounds 250,000, reduced from its
original Pounds 460,000. Its former barn, now converted into a five-bedroom
house, is still for sale at Pounds 230,000, down from Pounds 325,000.
Simon Backhouse, of Strutt &amp; Parker's Canterbury office (0227-451-123),
explains: 'We have got through the pain barrier of explaining to vendors
that prices are lower.' He is looking for offers around Pounds 375,000 for
Tonford Manor, a Grade II, 18th century moated house in nearly six acres at
Harbledown, near Canterbury; and is seeking Pounds 285,000 for the
11-bedroom Colkins, a Grade II Georgian house in almost two acres at
Selling, near Faversham.
'There are a lot of cash buyers about,' says Mary Grieves, of the Canterbury
office of Cluttons. Acting jointly with GW Finn &amp; Sons, it has just
exchanged contracts at around Pounds 350,000 on Jossenblock, a Grade II
Georgian house in more than two acres at East Langdon, near Dover. But Peter
Bell, the Cluttons' partner at Folkestone, is still seeking a buyer for his
own Grade II-listed country house: Jacques Court, near Canterbury, for which
he has been asking Pounds 550,000.
Those seeking flats might, however, have better prospects - in Folkestone,
at least. Says Bell: 'Until 1988, we had never been able to obtain corporate
rentals here, but we let 25 flats at a time in new blocks to Eurotunnel and
Trans-Manche Link for their senior managers. There will be a slight glut of
flats when the last people move out in 1994.'
