FDA PANEL BACKS DRUG FOR AIDS-RELATED PNEUMONIA 
Final marketing approval for aerosol Pentamidine, a drug to prevent 
AIDS-related pneumonia, was unanimously recommended Monday by a Food and Drug 
Administration advisory committee. 
FDA officials said the drug, made by Lyphomed Inc. of Melrose Park, Ill., could 
gain final agency approval "in a matter of weeks." 
The drug is already widely available to AIDS patients in this country under a 
special FDA effort to cut through red tape when desperately ill or dying 
patients are involved. 
After reviewing research results and hearing two hours of testimony from the 
public, the committee concluded that aerosol Pentamidine is safe and its 
benefits outweigh its risks in the prevention of AIDS-related pneumonia. 
Researchers who had evaluated the drug in a trial involving 408 patients in the 
San Francisco area told the panel it reduced the risk fourfold when given once 
a month in a 300-milligram dose, compared to a 30-milligram dose. 
FDA staff reviewers said more study is needed to gauge the drug's long-term 
side effects and benefits, but recommended approval nonetheless. 
The same panel today will review the safety and effectiveness of another drug 
for an AIDS-related infection. It will examine a drug called Ganciclovir, made 
by Syntex Corp. of Palo Alto.
