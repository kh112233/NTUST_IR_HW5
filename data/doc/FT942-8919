FT  18 MAY 94 / UK Company News: SNC creates S African venture
Smith New Court has reached agreement with a leading South African
stockbroker to establish a New York-based joint venture which will sell
South African shares to US investors.
Agreement has also been reached in principle for Smith to acquire up to 30
per cent of Davis Borkhum Hare, the stockbroker. The stake is the maximum
envisaged by the recently published report of the sub-committee of the South
African Stock Exchange.
Mr Michael Marks, Smith's chief executive, said the deal was intended to
capitalise on the anticipated demand from US institutions which for decades
have been discouraged from buying South African shares by widespread
American revulsion for apartheid.
So far, several US states, including New York, have lifted restrictions on
public sector pension fund investment in South Africa. And others, such as
California, are in the process of doing so, he said.
The joint venture will act as an agency broker for investors wishing to buy
South African shares and as the vehicle for South African clients of both
firms who wish to offer their shares for sale in the US.
