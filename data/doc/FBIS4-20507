<F P=106> [Interview with German Federal Minister for Research and </F>
Technology Paul Krueger by Martin Urban and Juegen Busche; place 
and date not given: "For me, research policy is not only a 
policy of subsidies."] 
  [TEXT] [Text below title quote] The CDU [Christian 
Democratic Union] politician credits Munich with being the site 
of Germany's most outstanding fusion research, but he also wants 
to place large-scale projects in the East. 
  [SZ--Sueddeutsche Zeitung] You did not get off scot-free 
from 
the last round of cutbacks; instead, you are now going to have 
to relinquish an additional 250 million marks from your tightly 
apportioned budget. How are you going to manage that without 
causing damage to German research? 
  [Krueger] For me, research policy is not only a policy of 
subsidies but involves much more. Its effectiveness cannot be 
secured just by money alone. The budget reduction in the Federal 
Ministry of Research and Technology will probably affect nearly 
all areas. In the area of personnel in the research 
installations, however, we will hardly be able to do any 
economizing, also because of the legal commitments in the 94th 
budget. That means that we will probably have to economize more 
sharply in the area of project funding, in the area of 
investments, in the area of materials and equipment in research 
facilities, and with international contributions. 
  [SZ] You wanted to save even more on space travel in any 
case 
than the Minister of Finance considers necessary. 
  [Krueger] The budget is not determined by the Federal 
Minister of Research alone but rather in the end by the 
Parliament. If it is up to me and my department, space travel 
will indeed share in the cut-backs. 
  [SZ] How does it look for fusion research? The decision on 
the W7X experiment, which the Institute for Plasma Physics is 
very interested in, still has to be made. Is the experiment 
going to be done, and if so, where? 
  [Krueger] I do believe that the W7X stellarator [experiment] 
will happen. That is, after all, a project which is currently 
being examined within the scope of the European fusion program 
and which, if necessary, could be sponsored via the EU. So I 
believe that the resources will be sufficient also for a 
medium-term realization of the W7X. 
  [SZ] Where? 
  [Krueger] Since we are planning to build a fusion site in 
Greifswald, Greifswald will probably be considered for this. We 
are trying over the long term to create an innovative landscape 
for research in Eastern Germany as well. That also means putting 
some large-scale equipment in the new states and not always just 
adding still more [pieces of equipment to areas] which already 
have a lot. 
  [SZ] Does that mean that the Max Planck Institute for Plasma 
Physics has its future already behind it? 
  [Krueger] I do not look at it that way. Because outstanding 
work has been done here. Even if the stellarator research is 
moved to Greifswald, important large-scale equipment for fusion 
research would remain in Garching and would make preliminary 
work for the world-wide ITER project possible. 
  [SZ] What are the scientists there supposed to do if they do 
not get the new experiment? The large ITER test reactor is only 
a hope. Apart from the fact that the next fusion reactor, if it 
is operated with radioactive tritium, would have to be approved 
in accordance with the Atomic Energy Law--and according to the 
explanation of the SPG [Social Democratic Party of Germany], 
this would not receive majority approval in Germany. 
  [Krueger] We'll have to wait and see about that. I think 
that 
Munich is currently the most outstanding site of fusion research 
in Germany, that Greifswald could be a complement to Munich, 
possibly as part of the Munich institute; and the nuclear 
research center in Karlsruhe will continue to have a future. 
  [SZ] From what you are not saying, it follows that the 
Juelich nuclear research installation no longer has any future 
in fusion research. 
  [Krueger] It has not been finally decided yet what will 
happen with Juelich after the fusion experiments which are 
currently running are completed. So I am not able to say 
anything definitive either. 
  [SZ] What is your position on the new atom reactor project 
in 
Garching? 
  [Krueger] First of all, we need clear decisions in Bavaria 
in 
this regard. In addition, we have to see what financing 
shortages we already have now in the area of funding for 
university or college construction. A new research reactor would 
have to be financed very substantially through the Law to 
Promote College Construction. We have announced support for when 
that time comes of a firm investment cost subsidy of 160 million 
and an operating cost subsidy of 80 million marks. And if the 
project does become definite, we will make this sum available. 
  [SZ] In the face of criticism from the USA, how do you, as a 
politician at the federal level, assess the problem of 
proliferation via the highly enriched nuclear fuel which is 
supposed to be used in Garching? 
  [Krueger] There are no official statements on the part of 
the 
American government regarding this. But we should not 
underestimate the public discussion about it. The [German] 
government does not see any proliferation. All of the nuclear 
fuel of the research reactor is completely subject to the 
security measures of the European Atomic Energy Community 
(EURATOM)and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEO). As 
soon as the FRM's concrete reality becomes apparent, we should 
try very quickly to reach a clarification of these questions 
with the American government. 
  [SZ] You want to shorten the road from basic research to 
production for the market. That leads among other things to [the 
situation] that large research facilities which are now suddenly 
supposed to being trying for marketability are in competition 
with the Frauenhofer Institutes, which have traditionally been 
there to carry out applied research. 
  [Krueger] I do not see direct competition here. 
  [SZ] It will be seen and spoken of that way on both 
sides. 
  [Krueger] We want to help those sections of the large 
research facilities which are already more oriented toward 
applications to be given work which is line with our strategy, 
which we recognize as significant for the future. 
  [SZ] Are you considering doing something to help foster 
independance for the generation of college graduates in, for 
example, the chemical industry, where there are almost no jobs 
to be found now? 
  [Krueger] We are thinking a great deal about how we can 
support the basic requirements for livelihood. There is a whole 
series of programs for this. Right now in the new states, where 
the deficit is the greatest, these special subsidies for 
technologies extend to supporting the start-up of 
technology-oriented businesses. 
  [SZ] Subsidies also through the FMRT [Federal Ministry of 
Research and Technology]? 
  [Krueger] Yes. Although I doubt that young graduates are in 
the position to already be starting businesses. What is 
important is that we in general take more graduates into 
businesses. We are currently giving intensive thought to 
possibly also creating new incentives in innovative areas in 
industry in order to be able to place good graduates of colleges 
and universities. 
  [SZ] How is your collaborative work with the Ministry of 
Education going? 
  [Krueger] Smoothly and well. Better coordination of the 
research facilities would be necessary, particularly the 
facilities on the so-called "blue list." 
  [SZ] Since, as you said at the beginning, you now 
necessarily 
have to limit project research, a whole series of small 
businesses which live off of projects in, for example, energy 
research for the Ministry of Research will either go under or 
substantially down-size and will in any case have to let people 
go. 
  [Krueger] Funding from the FMRT should in any case only be 
jump-start financing, not a long-term subsidy. I hope that 
through the many measures we are undertaking we will help 
industry work more closely with research facilities and also 
with business facilities which are active in research. I hope 
that we are more successful than we have been in the past. 
  [SZ] Would a change in the guidelines for granting funds be 
necessary in this regard? 
  [Krueger] I hope that industry comes to the position of 
giving away more contracts to third parties--that is, of using 
commissioned or contracted research more intensively. At this 
point only two percent of the total research expenditures of 
business and industry is used for contracts [for research] to 
third parties. That seems to me to be too little. Otherwise, it 
cannot be the case that the government, at least with the budget 
reductions, has to see to it that private research facilities 
are receiving project funding right along with public research 
facilities. 
  [SZ] On the other hand, it is surely important that we do 
not 
thoughtlessly risk the expert knowledge we have available. And 
what you are now allowing to fall apart will take a long time to 
rebuild in better times. 
  [Krueger] I can only spend the money that I have. 
  [SZ] Do you think that your demand that research 
expenditures 
be offset by taxes beginning in 1995 still has a chance, and how 
should the finance minister who is then in office balance that 
out? 
  [Krueger] We are working on creating a preferential system 
for research and development with regard to taxes. How this will 
look is currently being worked out among the Federal Ministry of 
Research and the other departments, particularly the Federal 
Ministry of Finance. 
  [SZ] Do you consider it possible to recoup from businesses 
which are now doing well financially thanks to government 
funding of research some of the money which the government gave 
them? 
  [Krueger] We are already doing that. 
  [SZ] Where? 
  [Krueger] The good businesses spread things out, since 
according to the funding requirements of the FMRT they have to 
grant licenses to competitors. The government joins in the 
revenue. By the way, we have the highest tax rates in the world. 
  [SZ] They affect the good and the bad. 
  [Krueger] I do not view [the idea which] you are addressing 
to be a very good solution now, because it is very difficult to 
prove in individual cases how large the portion of the FMRT 
research subsidy was in concrete product developments. I think 
we should stay with our role as sponsor. 
  [SZ] It is often said about universities that students in 
Ph.D. programs must be increased, must be supported more. What 
is your view? 
  [Krueger] We still need a variety of measures regarding how 
we can do better at fostering future workers, including members 
of the elite. That, however, costs money. 
  [SZ] People have placed their hopes in the restructuring of 
the East German universities. 
  [Krueger] We created the innovation courses for East 
Germany. 
They are approved so far. Another matter is the funding program 
"Cooperation in Research" begun in September 1993. Among other 
things, this deals with the funding of research and development 
personnel transfers between businesses and research facilities 
done to maintain a kind of an intellectual transfer of 
technology. That is a very efficient form of technology transfer. 
  [SZ] Will you have to put the brakes on the Max Planck 
Society in their efforts to develop activities in the new states? 
  [Krueger] The Max Planck Society has our pledge to 
financially cover all measures which are tackled there. It is, 
however, to be feared that the building of new Max Planck 
Institutes will be more difficult to manage than the financing. 
  [SZ] Does that have something to do with the problems of the 
states? 
  [Krueger] It has first of all to do with the fact that it is 
difficult to summon qualified people to settle in the new states 
before general conditions are created which the scientists 
accept.
