Notice of Proposed Validation Requirements for Products Implementing Federal Information Processing Standards;
Publication (FIPS PUB) 1401, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules

Notice.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

NIST invites interested members of the public to review validation requirements that have been developed for products
that implement FIPS PUB 1401, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. NIST plans to establish a
product certification program using independent third party laboratories to validate cryptographic modules for
conformance to the security requirements of FIPS 1401. The requirements for certification will be finalized
after the proposed procedures, inspections and tests for conformance have been determined. A National Voluntary
Laboratory Accreditation Program will be set up to accredit the third party laboratories at an appropriate future
time. At this time, NIST solicits public review of the proposed procedures, inspections, and tests that will be used
and the expected results to be achieved in the validation of cryptographic modules.




Those wishing to review the validation requirements may obtain a copy from the Standards Processing Coordinator
(ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, room B64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899,
telephone (301) 9752816.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

NIST will continue to develop the validation program for FIPS 1401, and will issue notices as appropriate concerning
the program. Comments on the validation requirements are invited by May 25, 1994.
