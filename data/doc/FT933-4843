FT  07 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Ministers must offer Africa debt
lifeline
Sir, Your excellent and timely supplement, 'Africa, a continent at stake'
(September 1), rightly highlights the fact that IMF/World Bank Structural
Adjustment Programmes have fallen short of expectations and that few
problems in Africa are more burdensome and debilitating than external debt.
The supplement should be compulsory reading for the western finance
ministers attending this month's IMF/World Bank annual meeting in
Washington. A potential African recovery hangs by a thread. The meeting has
the power to throw Africa either a lifeline or a noose.
The last G7 summit in Tokyo failed to act on Africa's crushing debt. Africa
cannot afford a similar response from the IMF/World Bank meeting. The issue
is simple: if world leaders want to lead, then they have to deal decisively
with world problems.
