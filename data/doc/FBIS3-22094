  [Text] In Trieste, 300 kg of heroin have been seized. 
This is the largest amount of heroin ever seized by Italian 
authorities. The heroin was found in an Austrian truck [as 
received]. The driver has been arrested. The forwarding agent, 
based in [the Austrian province of] Styria, has also been taken 
to prison. The heroin was found in the truck that had been on a 
ferry crossing from Turkey. The official load was fruit and 
spice. The 80 percent pure heroin was to be sold in the Dutch, 
German, Italian, and Austrian markets. The smugglers had used 
pepper and paprika to divert the sniffer dogs' attention.
