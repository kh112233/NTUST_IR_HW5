CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
PORT COSTA; 
TRAIN KILLS 2 MEN WALKING ON TRACKS 
Two men killed when a Southern Pacific freight train hit them on tracks near 
the Contra Costa County community of Port Costa were identified by coroner's 
officials as a mentally retarded man and his counselor. Alan Boursse, 39, of 
the Berkeley area, and Georgio Melloni, 20, of Pinole, died in the accident 
about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco. Southern Pacific police officer 
Barry Ballence said two counselors and three clients from a Pinole residential 
facility were walking along the tracks when the eastbound train rounded a curve 
behind them. The train engineer saw a man about 100 yards away, walking in the 
middle of the tracks, with his back to the train, a Southern Pacific spokesman 
said.
