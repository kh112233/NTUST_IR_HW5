  [Text] Havana, 30 Dec (PL) -- Cuban tourism registered an 
increase of more than 25 percent in terms of the number of 
vacationers and gross income compared to the previous year, a 
high-ranking tourism official said today. 
  This means that slightly more than 600,000 foreigners 
visited 
tourist spots in Cuba during the past 12 months -- a period 
that, according to Enrique Rodriguez, vice president of the 
National Tourist Institute (INTUR), showed results that came 
from very hard work. 
  In brief statements to local reporters, Rodriguez said 
Cuba's 
tourism enterprises (INTUR, Cubanacan Corporation, and Gaviota 
Corporation) will work together in 1994 to boost tourism by some 
40 percent. 
  Special emphasis will be made (in 1994) to develop 
ecotourism 
and water activities (marinas and diving centers), Rodriguez 
said. 
  A noticeable gain in 1993 tourist activities also was 
registered by Cubana de Aviacion airlines, which, according to 
Director General Heriberto Prieto, carried more than 450,000 
travelers. 
  According to Prieto, aside from Cubana de Aviacion, 29 
foreign airlines fly to Cuba with 95 flights a week to nine 
tourist hubs.
