FT  29 APR 92 / Peace offer to Burma's minorities
BURMA'S military junta yesterday pledged to end harassment of two main
minority groups, continuing a series of political initiatives launched in
the past week apparently aimed at improving its tattered international
image.
State radio said the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc),
which overrode the result of a 1990 general election to stay in power, was
suspending its campaign against Karen ethnic rebels 'in view of national
unity and goodwill.'
Since January its forces had been trying to capture the Karen headquarters
at Manerplaw on the Thai border.
In the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, Mr Ohn Gyaw, Burmese foreign minister,
said the Slorc wanted the more than 200,000 Rohingya Moslem refugees who
have fled across that border 'to return to their homes as soon as possible,'
adding: 'There is no question of harsh treatment to our own people.'
The Slorc in mainly Buddhist Burma had previously insisted the refugees were
not its citizens. But refugee groups have said they will not return unless
human rights conditions improve in the western province of Arakan where most
of Burma's 3m Moslems live.
Since Gen Than Shwe took over last Thursday as head of the Slorc, replacing
the ailing hardliner, Saw Maung, 27 Burmese political detainees have been
released, with the Slorc saying it would release all such prisoners not
deemed a threat to national security.
Those released were said to include Mr U Nu, Burma's last democratically
elected prime minister, and four aides to Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the
opposition leader put under house arrest in 1989 for alleged subversion and
who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year.
