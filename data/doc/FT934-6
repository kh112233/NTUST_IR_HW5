FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Genentech expects drug to boost
1994 earnings
Genentech, the US bio-technology company, expects Pulmozyme, which the Food
and Drug Administration earlier yesterday approved as a treatment for cystic
fibrosis, to make a material contribution to the company's full-year 1994
earnings, Reuter reports from Los Angeles.
'I don't think it will be particularly material in the first quarter, but in
the 1994 full year it will be,' said Mr Kirk Raab, chairman.
Genentech, which is 60 per cent owned by Roche of Switzerland, said it
expected to begin shipping the drug to distributors in the US in
mid-January. Genentech said it had not yet determined pricing.
About 30,000 Americans suffer from cystic fibrosis. Mr Raab said he expected
Pulmozyme, an inhalant which is taken daily by patients, to have deep
penetration among most cystic fibrosis sufferers.
Pulmozyme is not indicated for children under five, because no clinical
trials have yet been conducted on that group.
