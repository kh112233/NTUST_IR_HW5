FT  15 SEP 94 / US researchers isolate breast cancer gene
An American research team has won the race for the most sought-after prize
in science this year - isolating the gene that causes an inherited form of
breast cancer.
Dr Mark Scolnick and colleagues at the University of Utah have found the
gene called BRCA1, responsible for an estimated 3 to 5 per cent of breast
cancers, ahead of a dozen other research groups in the US and Europe.
The discovery was announced last night by the US research journal Science,
which will publish details next month.
At the same time, Science said an international team led by Dr Douglas Eaton
of the Institute of Cancer Research in the UK was well down the road to
isolating a second gene, BRCA2, which probably causes another 3 to 5 per
cent of breast cancers.
Finding the two genes will enable scientists to develop tests that women
with a family history of breast cancer can take, to discover whether they
are individually at risk of developing an inherited form of the disease.
Prototype tests for BRCA1 may be available within two years.
Women who know they carry the genes will be able better to monitor
themselves for early signs of cancer - or even have a mastectomy as a
precaution. Those whose tests are negative, in spite of a family history,
will be reassured.
But scientists say the discoveries will eventually also help the 90 per cent
of breast cancer patients whose disease is not inherited. Random mutations
in the same genes are probably involved there too - and understanding the
chemical processes by which BRCA1 and BRCA2 trigger cancer will help
researchers develop drugs to treat the disease.
'These are very exciting stepping stones on the path to more effective
treatment and diagnosis of breast cancer,' said Dr Bruce Ponder, a UK Cancer
Research Campaign scientist working at Cambridge University on cancer genes.
'But it's important for people to realise that there are no immediate
practical consequences.'
The search for breast cancer genes - described last year by Dr James Watson,
a founder of modern genetics, as the most exciting story in medical science
 -has caught the scientific and popular imagination. The National Cancer
Institute and the US Army have responded to health lobbyists by devoting
many millions of dollars to the quest.
