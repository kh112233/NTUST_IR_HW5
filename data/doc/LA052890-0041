IN BRIEF: U.S. RESEARCHERS REPORT SUPERCONDUCTOR ADVANCE 
American researchers have reported an advance in the commercial production of 
superconductors. Paul Chu and colleagues at the University of Houston reported 
in the journal Nature last week that they had developed a continuous process 
for bulk production of an yttrium-barium-copper oxide compound capable of 
carrying electricity without any resistance. 
Superconductors convey electricity far faster than other materials; if 
perfected, they could be used in ultrafast computers and magnetically powered 
high-speed trains and considerably cut the cost of power generation. 
It was long thought that superconductivity could only be achieved at 
temperatures far too cold for practical use, but four years ago scientists 
discovered ceramic compounds capable of superconductivity at far higher 
temperatures. 
Chu and his team said they had produced a bar 2 inches long, 0.19 of an inch 
wide and 0.12 of an inch thick that conducted electricity consistently, a 
difficult task when producing ceramic oxides in bulk. It is the first report 
that something more than a thin wire or grain of superconductor material has 
been produced. 
Although the bar produced by Chu and his team is too small for practical use, 
the researchers said that theoretically bars of any desired length could be 
made.
