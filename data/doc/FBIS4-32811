Ministry in Havana on 27 May; from the NTV newscast -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] There was an attempted hijacking of a fishing vessel 
in Guantanamo Bay at 0910 on 27 May. The courageous action of 
the boat captain and Interior Ministry guards thwarted the 
hijacking, conducted by five individuals who work at that 
fishing facility. An Interior Ministry soldier was shot and 
injured by the hijackers, who were trying to leave Cuba 
illegally via the Yankee naval base. The hijackers tried to 
reach open seas once their initial plan failed. Two of the 
hijackers have been arrested, while the search for the other 
three continues.
