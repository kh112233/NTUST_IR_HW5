Pesticide Chemicals; Various Revocations




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 EPA is proposing to revoke tolerances and food additive and feed additive regulations established for residues of
17 pesticide chemicals in or on certain raw agricultural commodities (RACs), processed foods, and animal feeds.
EPA is initiating this action for those pesticides which have no food use registrations. The applicable registrations
for these pesticides have been canceled because of nonpayment of maintenance fees or by registrant request.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This document proposes the revocation of all tolerances and food additive and feed additive regulations (``tolerances'')
established under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a and 348)
for residues of the herbicides tributylphosphorotrithioite, 2-chloroallyldiethyldithiocarbamate, norea,
barban, sodium trichloroacetate, dinitramine, dipropetryn and bifenox; the plant regulators 1,2,4,5-tetrachloro-3-nitrobenzene
and cycloheximide; the insecticides 

O,O

-(dimethylsulfamoyl) phenyl phosphorothioate (including its oxygen analog), crotoxyphos, pirimiphos-ethyl,
chlorfenvinphos, phenothiazine, and flucythrinate; and the fungicide hexachlorophene in or on raw agricultural
commodities (RACs), processed foods, and feeds. EPA is initiating this action because all registered uses of these
pesticide chemicals in or on RACs and processed foods have been canceled. The registrations for these pesticide chemicals
were canceled because the registrant failed to pay the required maintenance fee, or the registrant voluntarily canceled
all registered uses of the pesticide.


Because there are no current food use registrations for any of these 17 pesticide chemicals, EPA proposes to revoke
the tolerances and food additive and feed additive regulations for these pesticide chemicals. A tolerance, food
additive, or feed additive regulation is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered
for a particular food use. The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these regulations.
Since there are no food use registrations of these products, and hence no legal use in the United States, and since these
pesticides are either not persistent, or sufficient time has elapsed since the prior use for residues to dissipate,
residues should not appear in any domestically produced commodities.
The tolerances and food and feed additive regulations listed in 40 CFR parts 180, 185, and 186 being proposed for revocation
are as follows: 180.186 (tributylphosphorotrithioite), 180.203 (1,2,4,5-tetrachloro-3-nitrobenzene),
180.233 (

O,O

-(dimethylsulfamoyl) phenyl phosphorothioate (including its oxygen analog)), 180.247 (2-chloroallyldiethyldithiocarbamate),
180.260 (norea), 180.268 (barban), 180.280 (dimethyl phosphate of 

alpha

-methylbenzyl-3-hydroxy 

cis

-crotonate (crotoxyphos)), 180.302 (hexachlorophene), 180.308 (pirimiphos-ethyl), 180.310
(sodium trichloroacetate), 180.319 (phenothiazine), 180.322 (2-chloro-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)
vinyl diethyl phosphate (chlorfenvinphos)), 180.327 (dinitramine), 180.329 (dipropetryn), 180.336
(cycloheximide), 180.351 (bifenox), 180.400 (flucythrinate), 185.3300 (flucythrinate),
and 186.3300 (flucythrinate).
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains any of these 17 pesticide chemicals may request, within
30 days after publication of this document in the 

Federal Register

, that the proposal to revoke the RAC tolerances be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e)
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation revoking the RAC tolerances
and processed food and feed additive regulations. Further, EPA is soliciting comments from anyone adversely affected
by revocation of these tolerances and food and feed additive regulations. EPA requests that any person adversely
affected by these revocations submit information providing the following specific information: 1. Are there any
existing stocks of the chemical? 
2. If so, how much? 
3. When will the stocks be depleted? 
4. How long would the commodities treated with these chemicals be in the channels of trade?
 Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300328]. All written comments filed
in response to this document will be available for public inspection in the Public Response Section, at the Virginia
address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.
The Agency has conducted an analysis in order to satisfy requirements as specified by Executive Order 12866 and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act. This analysis is available for public inspection in Rm. 1132 at the Virginia address
given above.


Executive Order 12866


Executive Order 12866 requires the Agency initially to determine whether a proposed regulatory action being proposed
or issued is a ``significant'' rule and therefore subject to the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e. Regulatory
Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2)
creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order. 
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 

Regulatory Flexibility Act


This proposed rule has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5
U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have an economic impact on small businesses, small organizations,
or small governmental jurisdictions.
This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the
subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner.
Since all domestic registrations for use of these 17 pesticide chemicals have been canceled, it is anticipated that
no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprises if these tolerances and food and feed additive
regulations are revoked.
Accordingly, I certify that this regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
