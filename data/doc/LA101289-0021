SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Another delay in the Nancy Hoover Hunter fraud trial was granted Wednesday when 
a juror said a death in her family required her to travel East for the funeral. 
Testimony is scheduled to resume Tuesday in the complex case against Hunter, 
50, former mayor of Del Mar and former lover of J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, who 
is serving a 20-year term for similar offenses. 
Hunter is charged with 197 counts of fraud, making false statements to 
authorities and income-tax evasion in connection with the failed J. David &amp; 
Co. run by Dominelli. 
The trial began in late March with jury selection and is one of San Diego's 
longest criminal trials.
