FRESNO NEWSPAPER ORDERED TO MAKE CHANGES IN VDTS 
In one of the few government rulings in the nation requiring specific 
protection for workers who use video display terminals, Cal/OSHA has ordered 
the Fresno Bee to provide adjustable furniture, training and hourly breaks from 
typing to lessen the risk of repetitive-strain injuries. 
The state workplace safety agency said the newspaper -- whose reporters and 
copy editors have complained for two years of widespread health problems 
related to intense VDT use -- must begin making some of the changes as early as 
next month. 
Bee executives said they plan to appeal the Cal/OSHA order because it 
duplicates planned equipment purchases and other measures already in effect. 
Representatives of the Northern California Newspaper Guild, whose complaint 
last spring led to the investigation, said they believe the paper would not 
have initiated those improvements as quickly without Cal/OSHA intervention. 
The state called for the changes in a "special order" made public late 
Wednesday after a final conference with newspaper officials. The order -- 
applicable only to the Bee -- was issued because the state has yet to develop 
regulations governing safe use of VDTs.
