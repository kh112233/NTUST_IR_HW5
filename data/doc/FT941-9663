FT  14 FEB 94 / Arab gunmen ambush Israeli agents
Arab gunmen killed an Israeli secret policeman and wounded two others in an
ambush in the occupied West Bank yesterday, agencies report.
The Arabs sprayed automatic gunfire at a car carrying undercover agents of
Shin Bet, Israel's internal security service. The Israeli army said the
agents were on 'operational duty' in Ramallah.
The Israelis returned fire but the Arab gunmen escaped.
The attack was blamed on the military wing of Hamas, the Moslem
fundamentalist group, which opposes Israel's accord with the Palestine
Liberation Organisation for self-rule in Gaza and part of the West Bank.
Hamas has been blamed for most of the attacks on Israelis since the
agreement was signed last September.
In Gaza, meanwhile, Palestinians killed two Arabs they suspected of aiding
Israel. At least 10 Arabs have been killed as collaborators in as many days.
