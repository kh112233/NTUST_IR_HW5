FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Improved volumes for BAT's tobacco side
BAT Industries strongly defended prospects for its tobacco business
yesterday, and reported improved volumes and profits in the US in spite of
the political backlash against smoking.
BAT said Brown &amp; Williamson, the third largest cigarette company in the US,
increased market share in the first half of 1994 from 10.3 per cent to 11.3
per cent, largely recovering the share it lost last year when Philip Morris
cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes.
B&amp;W increased domestic volumes by 20 per cent following a shake-up of its
sales force, and export volumes by more than 10 per cent. Operating profits
increased 76 per cent to Pounds 217m, benefiting from price increases in
value-for-money brands which account for 60 per cent of its US business.
BAT's performance outside the US was also strong. British-American Tobacco
lifted trading profits 9 per cent, in spite of difficult conditions in some
markets. Sales and profits in all operating divisions were up, with
particularly strong performances in Chile, Argentina, Singapore, Indonesia
and Australia.
However, trading profits were down at BAT Cigarettenfabriken, the German
business, because of a provision for relocation of a research facility.
German sales improved, although total exports fell in spite of a big
increase in exports to eastern Europe.
A problem area was the Souza Cruz business in Brazil, where Pounds 80m
profits last year were wiped out by weak economic conditions which led to
downtrading and increased cross-border imports. BAT said action by the
Brazilian government to stabilise the economy was likely to lead to
improvement next year.
Imperial Tobacco in Canada increased volumes and profits, benefiting from
the elimination of border trade after domestic tax reductions.
