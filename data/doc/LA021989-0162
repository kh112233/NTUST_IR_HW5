THE WORLD 
British Airways began inspecting passengers' electronic and electrical 
equipment following the announcement that explosives hidden in a radio-cassette 
player blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland on Dec. 21, killing 270 people. 
Britain's biggest airline was acting on a Department of Transport 
recommendation that all airlines using British airports examine radios, 
computers and other electronic or electrical equipment for possible explosives. 
British Airways is asking passengers to remove such equipment from their 
suitcases for a separate security check and, after clearance, to carry the 
pieces aboard as hand baggage. No major delays were reported as a result of the 
increased security.
