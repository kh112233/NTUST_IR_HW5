PROTESTERS DELAY NUCLEAR TEST AT NEVADA SITE 
Four protesters delayed but failed to halt the test of a British nuclear weapon 
Wednesday by infiltrating the remote Nevada Test Site and making their way to 
ground zero. 
The device, with an explosive force about 12 times that of the Hiroshima atomic 
bomb, was detonated at 11:17 a.m., more than two hours behind schedule after 
the four were removed by security officers, Department of Energy authorities 
said. 
The protest, by Greenpeace, is the second time in three years that anti-nuclear 
activists have infiltrated the sprawling desert site in an effort to halt such 
a test. Members of the group in Germany also staged a protest at the British 
Embassy in Bonn. All British nuclear tests are conducted in Nevada under a 
mutual defense treaty with the United States. 
Energy Department officials rejected claims that the four protesters were near 
ground zero until they popped into view of cameras monitoring the blast site 
during a technical hold six minutes from detonation. 
Greenpeace spokeswoman Junior Bridge identified the protesters as Juley Howard, 
23, Jane Gregory, 27, and Lorna Richardson, 25, all of London, and Michael 
Perry, 27, of the Rocky Mountain Peace Center. 
The four probably will be charged with trespassing, Energy Department spokesman 
Jim Boyer said. 
Motion from the blast was felt at Las Vegas City Hall and atop the city's 
high-rise hotels. It registered 5.1 on the earthquake scale at the National 
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
