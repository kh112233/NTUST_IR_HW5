  [Text] Moscow, March 1 (XINHUA) -- Russia's 
counter-intelligence agency today declared that it has arrested 
a top official of the country's war industry spying for Britain. 
  The official, whose name is not made public, was arrested on 
January 15 on a charge of treason. Criminal proceedings against 
him began 10 days later. 
  He was found providing the British intelligence agency with 
military and economic information, which covered Russia's latest 
developed arms, the amount of money for research in the 
country's defense and cooperation with other countries in 
military technology. 
  The official has reportedly confessed all the crimes he had 
committed. 
  The exposure of the case came after Russia's expulsion 
Monday 
[28 February] of a U.S. diplomat accused of being involved in 
spying activities. 
  Earlier last month, the United States lodged a protest with 
Russia over an espionage case involving a top U.S. intelligence 
official and his wife, who had spied for Russia and the former 
Soviet Union for about nine years.
