WORLD; 
S. AFRICA APARTHEID FOE TO RETIRE 
Helen Suzman, the country's most durable anti-apartheid politician, announced 
today that she will retire in September after 36 years in Parliament. 
Suzman, 71, is the longest-serving member of Parliament, having represented the 
same Johannesburg constituency since 1953. 
From 1961 through 1974, she was the only legislator representing the 
anti-apartheid opposition and often cast the sole vote against discriminatory 
or repressive laws. 
She announced that she will not seek reelection on Sept. 6, when a general 
election will be held for the white, Asian and mixed-race chambers of 
Parliament. She has campaigned consistently to extend political rights to the 
black majority, which has no representation in Parliament.
