P.M. BRIEFING; 
CAR, OIL FIRMS TO TEST METHANOL 
The oil and auto industries, seeking to influence the outcome of Congress' 
debate over alternative motor fuels, today announced a joint program to test 
the pollution-cutting benefits of gasoline against methanol. 
Keith McHenry, senior vice president of technology at Amoco Corp., said the 
$11-million testing program would provide an "objective assessment" of the 
relative air quality benefits of methanol and new formulations of gasoline. 
The joint program, involving the Big Three auto companies and the 14 largest 
oil companies, is to begin immediately. A report on findings is due by next 
July or August. 
McHenry said too little was now known about the emission-reduction potential of 
methanol and reformulated gasoline for Congress and the states to make good 
decisions on policies aimed at curbing smog caused largely by burning fossil 
fuels.
