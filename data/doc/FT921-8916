FT  14 FEB 92 / Colliery accident investigation opens
INVESTIGATIONS began yesterday into an accident 1,000ft underground at
Wearmouth Colliery, Sunderland, Tyne and Wear (above), in which two men died
and three were seriously injured, Chris Tighe writes.
The accident brings to three the death toll at the colliery since September.
Mr Davy Guy, north-east region president of the National Union of
Mineworkers, said that the union believed serious accidents in the coalfield
were increasing as the number of miners was cut and working hours
lengthened.
The accident happened as a train carrying 70 men to the coalface was
derailed and the locomotive and first carriage became wedged against the
tunnel roof.
Production at the 160-year-old pit was suspended as the Health and Safety
Executive's Mines Inspectorate, British Coal safety officials and the mining
unions started investigations into the accident.
Mr Guy said: 'There appears at the moment to be a greater emphasis on
productivity and profitability than on the health and safety of the people
who work in the industry.'
British Coal said the drive for increased productivity at pits had not led
to falling safety standards. The number of fatal accidents in the industry
had declined from 28 in 1985-86 to 11 in 1990-91. 'Modern mining is not only
more productive but far safer than it used to be,' British Coal said.
Wearmouth, the only colliery in the north-east with long-term prospects, is
undergoing a Pounds 17.5m investment to open up a seam under the sea. It is
loss-making at present because productivity has dropped due to geological
difficulties.
The dead men, both transport workers, were named as Mr Eric Evans, 36, of
Penshaw, Tyne and Wear, and Mr Gerard Sumby, 39, of Sunderland.
Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, said safety was paramount in the coal
industry. 'We need to know what lessons can be learnt from this dreadful
incident,' he added.
