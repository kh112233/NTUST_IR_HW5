ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare a draft environmental impact statement/environmental impact report and notice of scoping
meetings.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the California Environmental
Quality Act of 1970, as amended, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) and the Hoopa Valley Tribe propose to prepare
a draft environmental impact statement/environmental impact report (EIS/EIR) to evaluate mainstem Trinity River
fishery restoration projects and to assist the Secretary of the Interior in developing recommendations for permanent
instream fishery flow requirements and Trinity River Division operating criteria and procedures for the restoration
and maintenance of the Trinity River Fishery, Trinity River Division, Central Valley Project (CVP), California.
Such recommendations are required by the Flow Evaluation Program, authorized by a January 14, 1981, Secretarial
Directive, and for Section 3406(b)23(A) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) dated October 30,
1992.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Construction of the Trinity River Division of the CVP was completed in 1963. The keystones of the division are Lewiston
Dam and Trinity Dam located just upstream of the town of Lewiston, California. The primary function of the Trinity
River Division is to store Trinity River water for regulated diversion to the Central Valley of California for agricultural,
municipal, and industrial uses. A substantial amount of electric power is generated as water diverted out of the Trinity
River Basin passes through four hydroelectric power generation plants.


Construction of the Trinity River Division resulted in the diversion of up to 90 percent of the average annual discharge
in the Trinity River at Lewiston, and blocked access to 109 miles of spawning and rearing habitat to migrating salmon
and steelhead. The Trinity River Hatchery was constructed at the base of Lewiston Dam to mitigate for those fish production
losses that occurred upstream of Trinity Dam, and annual fishery flows of 120,000 acre-feet were released from Lewiston
Dam to maintain existing salmon and steelhead habitat downstream. These measures were insufficient to maintain
the fishery, however, and populations of salmon and steelhead declined at a rapid rate following completion of the
Trinity River Division.
Reduced river flows, combined with excessive watershed erosion and encroachment of the river channel by riparian
vegetation, caused major changes in the morphology of the Trinity River downstream of Lewiston Dam. Reduced flows
were no longer capable of transporting large amounts of sediment downstream. As a result, sand began to fill holding
pools, spawning riffles, and over-wintering and rearing areas with devastating effects on existing anadromous
salmonid habitat.
In 1974, six State and Federal agencies formed the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Task force (Task Force) to
develop an action plan and seek funding for restoration of the fish and wildlife resources of the basin. In May 1982,
the Task Force completed a Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Management Program Report, which identified an action
plan consisting of 11 activities aimed at restoring fish and wildlife habitat. These activities included sediment
control and watershed stabilization, improvement of the Trinity River Hatchery, and habitat improvements in the
river and its tributaries.
In response to declining fisheries and degraded habitat conditions, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) decided
in 1981 to increase flows in the Trinity River from 120,000 acre-feet to 340,000 acre-feet annually, with reductions
in dry and critically dry years. In addition, the Fish and Wildlife Service was directed to undertake a 12-year Flow
Evaluation Study to assess fish habitat at various flows, develop a recommended flow regimen, and evaluate mainstem
channel restoration measures. The Flow Evaluation Study began in October 1984 and will conclude in September 1996.
In October 1984, the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act (Public Law 98541) was enacted by
Congress with the goal of restoring fish and wildlife populations to pre-CVP levels. The Act provided funding for
construction, operation, and maintenance of the 11-item action plan developed by the Task Force in 1982. The program
is administered by a field office staffed jointly by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Fish and Wildlife Service and
will end in 1995. The Act also identified a Task Force consisting of representatives from 14 Federal, State, and county
entities and the Hoopa Valley Tribe to assist and advise the Secretary. A 14-member Technical Coordinating Committee
has been established to assist and advise the Task Force and the field office. Modification of the mainstem channel
is a key element of the restoration program.
Section 3406(b)(23) of the CVPIA provides, through the Trinity River Division, an instream release of not less than
340,000 acre-feet of water to meet Federal trust responsibilities to protect fishery resources of the Hoopa Valley
Tribe and to meet the fishery restoration goals of Public Law 98541.
In accordance with Section 3406(b)(23)(A) of the CVPIA, of Public Law 102575, recommendations for mainstem
Trinity River fishery restoration will be developed after appropriate consultations with Federal, State and local
agencies and after completion of an on-going Flow Evaluation Study. The Secretary of the Interior is directed to complete
the flow study and recommendations by September 30, 1996. The draft EIS/EIR is expected to be completed and available
for review and comment by the end of 1995.
The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Hoopa Valley Tribe will seek public input on alternatives, concerns, and issues
to be addressed in the EIS through a series of scoping meetings. The schedule and locations of the scoping meetings
are as follows:



October 27, 1994, 6:30 pm to 9:00 pm, Elks Lodge
