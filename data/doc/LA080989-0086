THE WORLD 
Vietnamese "boat people" arriving at a refugee camp in Malaysia said pirates 
had attacked their craft, raping 15 women and throwing others overboard. At 
least 71 people were feared dead. The 13 survivors told U.N. refugee officials 
on the island of Bidong that they fled Vietnam in a group of 84 but were 
attacked by pirates in two fishing boats as they headed for Malaysian waters 
late Saturday. Workers on an oil platform off the Malaysian coast rescued three 
survivors and fishermen picked up the other 10. U.N. statistics show more than 
70 refugee boats have been attacked by pirates since January, 1988, with more 
than 400 refugees either missing or presumed dead.
