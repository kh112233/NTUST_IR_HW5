FT  06 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow pushed to record by blue
chips
Wall Street
BLUE CHIP shares rallied yesterday, lifted by an encouraging January
employment report and residual bullishness from the cut in German rates,
writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average scored yet another record high, climbing
25.40 to 3,442.14, but declines led rises by 1,017 to 890 on the NYSE. Other
market indices failed to keep pace with the Dow's muscular performance.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 eased 0.63 to 448.93 and the
Nasdaq composite dropped 7.87 to 700.98. The Amex composite moved higher,
rising 1.07 to 416.58. Trading volume on the NYSE was heavy at more than
324m shares.
The Dow, which surged more than 106 points in the first four days of the
week, was up by 42.95 on Thursday to 3,216.74.
Investors took heart from the January employment report, which showed a
106,000 addition to non-farm payrolls and a decline in the unemployment rate
from 7.3 per cent to 7.1 per cent. December non-farm payrolls were adjusted
up to 90,000 from 64,000.
Chrysler, which has moved steadily higher since the successful completion of
its huge new stock offering earlier this week, firmed by Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 40 7/8 . Among the other big three auto manufacturers, General
Motors rose by Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 and Ford slipped by Dollars  3/8
to Dollars 49 5/8 . Shares in cellular telephone companies, which rallied
earlier this week on reports that there was no evidence of a link between
cellular phone use and cancer, were mixed through the day. Motorola fell
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 53 1/4 , GTE added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 3/8
and McCaw Cellular was Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 33 3/4 .
Cyclical stocks once more contributed to the Dow's rally. Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing gained Dollars 3 to Dollars 108 3/4 , Aluminum Company of
America advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 77 5/8 and International Paper
improved Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 69 1/4 .
Drug stocks, which have been particularly vulnerable in recent months, ended
the day on a mixed note. Merck was quoted Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 38
3/8 after edging towards a 52-week low earlier in the day. Pfizer dropped
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 63 1/4 , Upjohn held steady at Dollars 29 3/8 and
Bristol-Myers Squibb rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 58 1/2 .
Barr Laboratories plummeted Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 9 after the company was
ordered by a federal district court to suspend, temporarily, 24 products.
The court denied a request by the Food and Drug Administration to shut down
the company altogether. The company has denied FDA allegations that it
committed unsafe practices.
In Nasdaq trading, shares in Amgen plunged Dollars 5 7/8 to Dollars 53 7/8 .
The biotechnology company's investment rating was cut by Mabon Securities
amid concern that Amgen's sales were slowing.
