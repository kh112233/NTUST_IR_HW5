El-Al Bombing at Zurich-Kloten. Airport Police equipped with 
High Technology"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] 
  [Text] Bern 15 Feb (ATS) -- After the 1969 Palestinian 
bombing, the police force at Zurich-Kloten airport has undergone 
quite some changes. Insignificant until then, it has turned 
into an 800-strong security force outfitted with 
state-of-the-art equipment. Two new projects will be carried 
out in the near future, namely the upgrading of the airport's 
enclosure and cargo installation. 
  Immediately after the bombing of the Israeli aircraft, a 
decision was made to separately control planes coming from and 
going to the Middle East. These are under permanent 
surveillance, airport police chief Ulrich Neeracher told ATS 
[Agence Telegraphique Suisse]. Mail is now controlled using 
X-ray devices. From the Fall of 1969, Swiss Army troops began 
guarding the airport; they remained in place for a year before 
being relieved by the Zurich canton police. 
  After a bomb explosion in the luggage compartment of a 
Swissair aircraft in February 1970, leading to its crash in 
Wuerenlingen, luggage control was introduced, as well as 
controls of Israel-bound freight. Since the hijacking of a 
Swissair plane to Jordan in Fall 1970, specially trained 
security agents accompany long-distance flights.

  Today, Zurich-Kloten's airport police uses state-of-the-art 
monitoring techniques: bomb detectors, or bicolor X-ray 
machines. Security measures are reinforced depending on the 
needs. The last maximum security alert was installed during the 
Gulf War, in early 1991. 
  In 1990, policemen managed to avert an attack against an 
Israeli El-Al plane, when they discovered a bomb inside a 
suitcase.
