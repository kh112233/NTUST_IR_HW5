FT  16 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Week In The Markets - Tin
prices climb to 18 1/2-month highs
WHILE MOST base metals moved cautiously higher on nervousness about the
possibility of a strike by German metal workers, tin values responded
positively this week to signs of an improvement in the fundamental market
situation.
Monday saw the three months delivery tin price at the London Metal Exchange
break through the resistance at Dollars 6,000 a tonne that had halted last
week's rise, and no time was wasted before an assault was mounted on the
next resistance area, at Dollars 6,100 a tonne. That barrier held out for a
couple of days and dealers were suggesting that a technical correction to
Dollars 6,000 might be needed before further ground could be made. But the
decisive breach came on Thursday, unleashing a fresh wave of buying, and the
three months price peaked at Dollars 6,240 a tonne, an 18 1/2 -month high,
before running into profit-taking. Yesterday the price was trimmed by
Dollars 5 to Dollars 6,192.50 a tonne, up Dollars 210 on the week.
The latest improvement in tin market sentiment, instigated by last week's
announcement of Brazilian plans to cut output, was given further
encouragement this week when the Association of Tin Producing Countries
forecast a sharp fall in world stocks. Another factor that traders said had
been encouraging the rise in prices was a moderate downtrend in LME
warehouse stocks, but that was reversed by a 215-tonne rise, to 12,045
tonnes, announced yesterday.
In a statement issued yesterday the tin producers' association said that the
expected stocks fall by the end of this year should help to firm prices and
might lead to an early end to the voluntary export quota system operated by
members of the ATPC, which does not include Brazil or China. 'We are pretty
close to normal stock level (of 20,000 tonnes),' said Mr Redzwan Sumun, the
association's executive secretary.
'We may keep the quotas for only six months in 1993.' He suggested that
further stock depletion resulting from production cuts could push prices to
MDollars 16 a kilogram - equivalent to Dollars 6,325 a tonne  - in the
coming months.
'Producers do not want to see steep rises or falls in prices as it will be
difficult for them to respond to demand,' Mr Redzwan said after a four-day
meeting of the ATPC executive committee.
The association put end-1992 world stocks at 25,000 tonnes, compared with
39,100 tonnes at the end of 1991 and 73,200 in early 1987, just over a year
after the collapse of the price-supporting International Tin Agreement. It
forecast that western world supply would fall from 1991's 166,000 tonnes to
157,000 in 1992, while consumption would remain at about 176,000 tonnes. But
the association expected that the implied stock drawdown of 19,000 tonnes
would be partly made up by an 1,800-tonne increase in Chinese exports, to
17,500 tonnes.
Mr Redzwan said the supply balance would hinge on sales of stockpiled tin by
the US Defence Logistics Agency, which would be asked to limit sales to
5,000 tonnes a year instead of the present 7,000 tonnes a year.
The biggest loser on the German strike fears was copper, of which Germany is
one of the biggest importers. The cash price at the LME slid to Pounds 1,215
a tonne before steadying yesterday to Pounds 1,223.50 a tonne, down Pounds
16.75 on the week.
Last week's downturn in the LME's cash zinc price was reversed as fears of
supply tightness in the June-July delivery period flared up again. The fall
continued on Monday, taking the price down to Dollars 1,332 a tonne and
narrowing the premium over three months metal to Dollars 70. But by
yesterday's close cash zinc was quoted at Dollars 1,372.5 a tonne, up
Dollars 23 on balance, and the premium stood at Dollars 101 a tonne.
Aluminium prices yesterday surrendered the modest gains achieved earlier in
the week, despite news of a 300-tonne fall in LME stocks, only the second
since August.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange coffee prices bounced strongly
from last week's 22-year lows in response to signs of a more positive
approach from producers to market stabilisation efforts. Brazilian officials
held talks with coffee industry representatives and a high level meeting
with the Colombians is scheduled for Monday. Meanwhile Costa Rica, which
accounts for about 3 per cent of world supply, announced that it was halting
exports in protest at low prices.
The July robusta coffee price recouped last week's fall with interest to end
Dollars 58 higher at Dollars 734 a tonne.
