Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 4B4426) has been filed by Betz Laboratories, 4636 Somerton Rd., Trevose, PA 19053. The petition
proposes that the food additive regulations in 176.170 

Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods

 (21 CFR 176.170) be amended to provide for the safe use of the copolymer of the sodium salt of acrylic acid with polyethyleneglycol
allyl ether in paper mill boilers.


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4 (b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before (

results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
