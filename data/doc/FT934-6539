FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: US drugs group to take Dollars
468m charge
Warner-Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals and consumer products group,
yesterday announced a Dollars 468m restructuring charge for the latest of a
series of rationalisations in the pharmaceuticals industry.
The company, the US's 14th largest drugs group, blamed the need for the
charge on the profound changes in the pharmaceuticals market place. It
mentioned in particular the growth of managed care in the US, the partial
loss of tax credits from manufacturing in Puerto Rico, and healthcare
reforms in Europe.
The group is using the charge to close seven manufacturing sites, streamline
its salesforce of 1,300 people, and restructure Parke Davis, its
pharmaceuticals division. It said resources would be focused on its new
Alzheimer's drug Cognex. The restructuring would reduce the workforce by
about 2,800 over the coming years.
Mr Melvin Goodes, chief executive, said the company would continue to
strengthen its consumer operations through productivity improvements. The
charge of Dollars 468m is on a pre-tax basis. On a post-tax basis it amounts
to Dollars 327m, or Dollars 2.43 a share. It will be taken against
fourth-quarter earnings.
Research and development spending in the pharmaceuticals division is
currently running at about 20 per cent of sales, as the group struggles to
bring new products to market.
The drugs operations, generating sales of about Dollars 2bn a year, have
been suffering from the expiry in January of the US patents of Lopid, its
top-selling cholesterol-lowering drug which generated sales last year of
Dollars 556m. Revenues from Cognex were held up by the drug's late US
approval in September.
Warner-Lambert also lost Dollars 150m worth of sales this year because it
was forced to shut down six manufacturing plants in the US following
concerns by the Food and Drug Administration.
