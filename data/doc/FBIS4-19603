  [Text] Bayonne, France, April 18 (AFP) -- At least three 
French trawlers were ablaze on Monday [18 April] after being 
attacked by 60 Spanish fishing boats off this south-western 
port, French authorities said. 
  The French air-sea rescue organisation CROSS-A said the 
Spanish crews, from the frontier port of Fontarrabie, came 
alongside the French boats and hurled diesel oil and petrol 
bombs aboard in a dispute over anchovy fishing. 
  The Spanish crews hurled stones and cut across the bows of 
the 12-strong French flotilla, CROSS-A said. 
  It named the three burning boats as the Gael Julienne, the 
Laetitia, and the Mefi. 
  The French patrol boats Mauve and Reseda set sail to try to 
restore order at the scene, but the Mauve became entangled in 
hawsers and nets dropped by the Spanish. 
  CROSS-A said no French ships large enough to intervene were 
in the immediate vicinity. The 60 Spanish vessels were massed 
off Bayonne. 
  The Spanish fishermen say the French have violated bilateral 
agrements endorsed by the European Union under which their 
anchovy fishing campaign should have ended on March 31.
