SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
U.S. BAN ON USING FETAL TISSUE DOESN'T STOP RESEARCH; 
HEALTH: NOVEL EXPERIMENTS IN ANIMALS STIR EXCITEMENT AMONG SCIENTISTS. 
The timing was ironic. As 12,000 researchers gathered recently at the Society 
for Neuroscience's annual meeting, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. 
Sullivan extended indefinitely a ban on federally funded fetal tissue 
transplants. 
The moratorium, which predominantly affects neuroscientists, forbids federal 
support for experimental transplants into humans of tissue from intentionally 
aborted fetuses. Continuing a ban initiated in March, 1988, by the Reagan 
Administration, it does not apply to transplants of animal fetal cells. 
Sullivan, rejecting the conclusions of a National Institutes of Health advisory 
committee convened last year, decided that "permitting the human fetal research 
at issue will increase the incidence of abortion across the country." 
Though the extended ban has angered many neuroscientists, researchers at the 
conference shared a wealth of data from novel experiments in animals -- many 
involving transplants of nonfetal nerve cells that may some day find 
application in humans. While most neuroscientists doubt nonfetal cells will 
ever match the therapeutic potential of fetal cells, this work stirs excitement 
among many researchers. 
But whatever the potential of nonfetal substitutes, fetal cells remain 
neuroscientists' tissue of choice. Some experiments indicate fetal tissue may 
prove valuable in treating Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and other 
neurodegenerative conditions. For example, the first U.S. patient to receive 
such a transplant -- a 52-year-old man with a 20-year history of Parkinson's 
disease -- has responded to his surgery with significant improvements in 
mobility, reports Curt R. Freed of the University of Colorado School of 
Medicine in Denver, who performed the surgery with private funds in November, 
1988. 
The federal ban undoubtedly will minimize the number of such surgeries in the 
near future, further delaying any conclusions about the procedure's 
effectiveness in humans, Freed said. Moreover, the few privately funded U.S. 
researchers continuing to experiment with human fetal cell transplants complain 
bitterly about being relegated to the status of scientific renegades. 
But economic and political problems are not the only factors prompting 
neuroscientists to seek alternatives to human fetal cells. "The (funding) 
problems have in part stimulated people to look for alternatives, but this 
would have evolved even if there hadn't been a ban on fetal tissues," said Fred 
H. Gage of UC San Diego. "We're expanding our horizons; we're looking for 
options." 
Gage and his colleagues recently demonstrated that nonfetal cells do show some 
promise. Recently, they reported that they had successfully transplanted 
genetically engineered rat-skin cells called fibroblasts into the brains of 
rats with a syndrome resembling Parkinson's disease. Engineered to secrete the 
brain chemical dopamine, which has been found in short supply in Parkinson's 
patients, the cells alleviated the rats' symptoms by an average of 35% and may 
hold potential as a treatment for Parkinson's, said Gage and others. These 
experiments were described in the November proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences. 
Researchers elsewhere are experimenting with other nonfetal cells -- some 
gene-altered and some not -- with equally intriguing preliminary results. For 
example, many presentations at this year's neuroscience meeting focused on 
transplants of fibroblasts genetically engineered to produce substances such as 
nerve growth factor, a protein that stimulates nerve regeneration. These cells, 
when implanted into the brains of rats suffering from nerve damage, stimulate 
neuronal repair. 
Other researchers have transplanted young astrocytes -- star-shaped, central 
nervous system cells -- from donor rats onto injured spinal cord tissue in 
recipient rats. Astrocytes belong to a class called glial cells, which provide 
physical and biochemical support for neurons. Reports at the neuroscience 
meeting indicate that transplanted astrocytes and other types of glial cells 
appear to improve coordination in the injured rats by stimulating the 
production of nerve-nurturing substances around the injury and by preventing 
scarring there. Tiny scars can block regenerating neurons from renewing 
connections with surviving nerve endings. 
"It's become a very hot area to look for cells that secrete factors that may 
facilitate repair," Timothy J. Collier of the University of Rochester (N.Y.) 
School of Medicine and Dentistry said. "Everyone's very interested in glial 
cells, which seem to make damaged cells happier." 
Researchers have begun genetically engineering glial cells in attempts to 
enhance their therapeutic potential. However, Freed said, "it will be some time 
before we become as comfortable with custom-made cells as we are with fetal 
cells, which we understand much better." 
Moreover, scientists have yet to demonstrate that engineered cells can perform 
all the functions of their fetal counterparts. "I absolutely support 
(engineered) cell-line research to come up with improved transplant material," 
said D. Eugene Redmond, director of the neurobehavior laboratory at Yale 
University. "But the probability of taking something like a fibroblast and 
engineering into it all the factors necessary for neuronal function and 
communication so it knows who to talk to, when to release its transmitter. This 
may involve a thousand things." 
Added Gage: "It certainly is clear that fetal neuronal transplants are more 
effective than any of the other cell types at present." 
Indeed, fetal cells today seem awash in scientific praise. "Their ability to 
survive and multiply necessitates the grafting of only small numbers of cells . 
. . and they are adaptable to the host environment," wrote University of 
Rochester neurobiologists John T. Hansen and John R. Sladek in a review article 
in the journal Science. "The benefits of studying fetal cells are many, and the 
clinical potential for their use as therapeutic tools is just now being 
realized." 
In contrast, Redmond noted, gene-altered fibroblasts and other engineered cells 
"are going to be extremely suspect" because of their potential to divide 
uncontrollably, like cancerous tumors. "Some of these alternatives are going to 
have extreme liabilities." 
At this point, Gage said, no one really knows whether fetal cells can live up 
to their exalted promise. Ban or no ban, he thinks researchers need to conduct 
more fetal cell transplants into animals -- a procedure allowed under the 
moratorium -- before embarking on widespread human trials. 
But until the fetal cell transplants into humans can proceed unimpeded, their 
value will remain an open question, Gage and others say. And the decision on 
whether to go ahead with such trials should be based upon scientific rationale, 
they insist. 
"None of the reasons for the ban had anything to do with bad science or good 
science or whether or not it's reasonable to pursue this work on scientific 
grounds," Gage said. "I can't believe that patients with degenerative diseases 
are not up in arms. It doesn't seem real. But, then, I'm a scientist."
