  [Text] A worrisome fact that could be a decisive factor for 
the expansion of poppy plantations in the country is the coca 
growers' readiness to replace their traditional coca plantations 
with poppy plantations. 
  The Cedro [Information and Education Center To Prevent Drug 
Abuse] has conducted a poll among 200 peasants from various 
settlements of San Martin and Huanuco Departments. Only 12 
percent of them said they would not replace coca with poppy. 
  Another 28 percent said that they would and the remaining 60 
percent were undecided. They said that, depending on the 
circumstances, they might. 
  Considering that the price of coca is extremely low and that 
very few people are purchasing coca leaves, these "undecided" 
peasants could easily begin to plant poppies. 
<H5>  A Matter of Survival </H5>
  Our correspondent in Tarapoto talked to Jesus Rivera, leader 
of the Selva Maestra Agrarian Federation (Fasma). Rivera 
asserted that a large number of peasants were willing to plant 
poppy if they had someone to sell it to. 
  "It is a matter of survival. The peasants must survive and 
to 
be able to do so they are willing to plant poppy. They have no 
other option because they have no access to loans that would 
enable them to replace their coca plantations with subsistance 
crops or any other authorized crop," he said. 
  Rivera, who participated in the crop replacement program 
negotiations, said that a large numnber of peasants have 
threatened to begin sowing poppy seeds next month, unless the 
government grants them credit or some other sort of assistance, 
as the regional officials have promised.
