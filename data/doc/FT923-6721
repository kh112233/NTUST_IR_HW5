FT  22 AUG 92 / Wind farm for east coast
EUROS POWER, a subsidiary of Unigroup, the timber and building products
company, yesterday announced plans to commission within the next three
months the first wind turbine farm on the east coast.
The Pounds 2m-plus farm at Blood Hills, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk will produce
about 6m kilowatt/hours of electricity per year from 10 wind turbines,
enough to supply the energy needs of about 1,200 homes.
