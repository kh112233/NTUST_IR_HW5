FT  10 NOV 93 / VW may agree to suspend managers
SEVERAL top Volkswagen managers may be ordered temporarily to stop work if a
legal compromise between the German automotive group and rival Adam Opel is
approved by the two companies' boards later this week.
Prospects of a deal, which could end one of the legal battles between the
groups, emerged after private negotiations in the back room of a Frankfurt
court yesterday.
An open-court hearing, called to consider an appeal from Opel, the General
Motors subsidiary, that seven former GM group employees should be banned
from working at VW for a year, was adjourned after presiding judge, Mr Heinz
Traub, recommended that the two sides should look for a compromise.
An earlier attempt by Opel to win a temporary banning injunction was turned
down because, the court decided, the seven had been drawn to VW by the
'charisma' of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM executive who
defected to VW in March.
Further evidence has since emerged to support Opel's claim that Mr Lopez and
colleagues systematically poached key GM group employees. Volkswagen is
still bound by a separate injunction not to continue this practice.
Under orders from Judge Traub to keep strictly silent or risk endangering
the outcome, neither company would discuss yesterday's deal.
It is believed that three or four of the seven, including Mr Jorge Manuel
Gutierrez, head of VW production and Mr Lopez's closest colleague, may be
suspended if the companies' boards approve before the end of this week - a
deadline set by Mr Traub.
Criminal investigations into suspicions that Mr Lopez, Mr Gutierrez and
colleagues stole secret GM data before leaving for VW, are continuing. A
probe into possible perjury by Mr Lopez is also under way.
