FT  13 MAY 93 / People: Glaxo cures R&amp;D gap
Concerns about the enormous responsibilities of Dr Richard Sykes, Glaxo's
research and development director and recently appointed chief executive,
were partly met yesterday when Dr Goran Ando was appointed R&amp;D director of
Glaxo group research, the UK research arm and the company's largest research
arm.
Analysts had believed that it was impossible for one man to cope as chief
executive and be responsible for R&amp;D. Glaxo last year spent nearly Pounds
600m on R&amp;D - more than any other pharmaceutical company. It has research
sites in the UK, US, Italy, France and Spain and employs more than 6,800 R&amp;D
specialists.
Dr Ando, who joined Glaxo in 1989 as medical director, was made deputy R&amp;D
director in March last year. He was responsible for co-ordinating all
development, medical and regulatory functions in the company's international
pharmaceutical development programmes. He retains responsibility for
world-wide drug development.
A 44-year-old Swede, Dr Ando was previously at Astra, the Swedish group,
where he was president of the group research centre. Before that he held
positions at Pfizer and Bristol-Myers.
Dr Sykes retains the chairmanship of Glaxo group research as well as
responsibility for R&amp;D on the Glaxo board.
