MAN BARRED FROM ONE JURY HE'D LIKE TO BE ON 
Calvin Gene Eslick is considered a shoo-in for an exemption from jury duty 
later this month, whether he wants it or not. His name was selected at random 
for a jury pool in the Feb. 27 trial of a man charged with first-degree murder 
in the stabbing death of his estranged wife. Eslick is the defendant.
