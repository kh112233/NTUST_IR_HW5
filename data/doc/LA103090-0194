THE SIDELINES; 
PAROLE DATE SET FOR DIVER KIMBALL 
Former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball will serve less than five years of a 17-year 
sentence for a 1988 drunk-driving accident that killed two teen-agers, the 
Florida Parole Commission decided today. 
The commission voted to release Kimball on Nov. 24, 1993. 
That date is firm unless the case is brought back to the commission for 
disciplinary action by the Department of Corrections, parole spokeswoman Ruth 
Anne Reese said. 
Kimball, who pleaded guilty to two manslaughter charges, has served about 22 
months of his sentence for the Aug. 1, 1988, drunk-driving accident that killed 
two and seriously injured three. 
A silver medalist in 1984, Kimball was in training for the 1988 Olympics. At 
the time of the accident, he had a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit.
