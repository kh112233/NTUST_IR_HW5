WORLD; 
SOVIETS SHIFT POLICY ON WORLD COURT 
The Soviet Union reversed itself today and said it is ready to accept the 
jurisdiction of the World Court in disputes on certain human rights issues. 
Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamishin told a U.N. meeting that 
Moscow had dropped previous reservations on optional clauses in five 
international human rights accords allowing unresolved disputes to be submitted 
to the World Court in The Hague. 
These accords, he said, covered preventing and punishing genocide, suppressing 
traffic in persons and exploitation of prostitution, recognizing the political 
rights of women, eliminating all forms of racial discrimination and a 
convention against torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or 
punishment.
