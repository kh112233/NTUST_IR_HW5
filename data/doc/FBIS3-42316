  [Text] One of the ETA members most wanted by the Spanish 
police was arrested today in France. Jesus Garcia Corporales, 
alias Gitanillo, was arrested this morning in Hendaye by the 
French border police. He was carrying false identity papers and 
a pistol. His partner Maria Isabel Fernandez was arrested with 
him. 
  During the same police operation, but in Biarritz, another 
woman, Agnes Cerlot, was also arrested. She is a French 
national and five years ago she was convicted for cooperation 
with ETA member Josu Ternera. 
  Garcia Corporales has been identified as a member of ETA's 
Madrid Commando. In April last year, his picture, along with 
those of Jose Javier Ariskuren, alias Josetxu, and Maria Soledad 
Iparraguirre, alias Sole or Elisabet, was on a poster put up in 
thousands of places and public buildings throughout Spain.
