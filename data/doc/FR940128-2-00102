 

For some projects, EPA may transfer funding to another Federal agency that will match those funds with funds of their
own or with those of a private sector partner. Not all collaborative efforts, however, may entail transfers of funding
among Federal partners or private partners. Rather, EPA is more interested in finding partners who can offer collaboration,
resources and expertise to make each project a success. Many partnership opportunities are available. For example:




_Developing technologies to depolymerize/repolymerize plastics for recycling (Project No. 4); 
_Changing to cleaner processes in plating and metal finishing that reduce the use of toxic chemicals, generate less
waste, and reduce energy and natural resource consumption (Project No. 5); 

_Piloting applications of advanced adsorption technologies that can filter wastewater, drinking water and contaminated
groundwater and clean-up polluted aquatic ecosystems (Project No. 7); 

_Developing alternative surface cleaning technologies to replace products and systems using hazardous chemicals
or volatile organic solvents that pose health or environmental risks (Project No. 8); 

_Evaluating techniques that are used to reduce metallic ores to base metals for applications in managing solid and
hazardous wastes (Project No. 18);

_Demonstrating supercritical carbon dioxide extraction technologies that reduce reliance on toxic solvents and
the generation of hazardous wastestreams (Project No. 19); 

_Documenting the performance of soil washing as an alternative remedial technology for cleaning up contaminated
sites (Project No. 20); 

_Demonstrating pilot-scale chemical dechlorination by the recently-licensed, base-catalyzed decomposition
process to clean-up soils contaminated with PCBs, pentachlorophenol, and chlorinated insecticides and herbicides
(Project No. 23); and, 

_Developing and demonstrating new metalforming technologies to find substitutes for toxic chlorinated solvents,
cyanides and cadmium that prevent pollution and reduce the generation of hazardous wastestreams (Project No. 38).




Parties interested in these or any other projects, or becoming a project partner, may contact the project manager
identified in the 

FY 1994 Program Plan

. Project managers are interested in hearing from those who are working on similar projects; those who are interested
in offering expertise, experience, test sites or other resources; and, those who are qualified to comment on the technical
aspects of each project's value, significance and appropriateness.
