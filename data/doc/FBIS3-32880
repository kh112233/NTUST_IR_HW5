  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Feb (PL) -- Carlos Lage, vice 
president of the Cuban Council of State, described reports of 
Raul Castro's alleged ties to the Medellin drug-trafficking 
cartel as infamous and offensive. 
  Lage, who is on an official visit to Colombia, was 
interviewed by RCN Radio Network and the newspaper EL ESPECTADOR 
regarding reports that a videocassette showed an alleged member 
of the Cartel appearing before Pablo Escobar -- who was killed 
recently -- requesting his aid to contact Raul Castro, minister 
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba. 
  The morals and ethics of the Cuban revolution have been 
tested throughout its history. Neither narcotics nor corruption 
have stained it. We, therefore, do not have the slightest 
concern about that, the Cuban leader told EL ESPECTADOR. 
  He noted that Raul Castro "enjoys great prestige and the 
love 
of our people." Lage did not rule out the possibility that this 
accusation is part of "a manipulation by the enemies of the 
revolution" who have tried incessantly to involve the island in 
drug trafficking. 
  Lage told RCN that Cuba has the fewest drug problems of any 
country in the world because there is no consumption, 
corruption, or organized crime.
