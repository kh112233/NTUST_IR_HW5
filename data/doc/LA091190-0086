FIRM EXPANDS DISTRIBUTION OF NEW AIDS DRUG 
The free distribution of the promising AIDS drug DDC is being widened to 
include possibly thousands more patients, a drug company announced Monday. 
In June, the Food and Drug Administration gave Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. of 
Nutley, N.J., permission to provide dideoxycytidine, or DDC, to AIDS patients 
who cannot take the two currently available drugs to combat the AIDS virus. 
Those drugs are AZT, the only fully approved AIDS-fighting drug, and DDI, an 
experimental drug already offered through a similar expanded access program. 
About 100 people with AIDS or advanced AIDS-related complex have been receiving 
DDC through that route, and another 1,000 patients are taking the drug in the 
more strictly monitored tests required for government drug approval, said Paul 
Oestreicher, a Hoffmann-La Roche spokesman. 
Now, the drug maker is dropping the requirement that a doctor must demonstrate 
that a patient cannot take DDI before being allowed to start DDC. That move 
will likely increase the number of patients in the expanded-access program. "It 
could potentially be thousands more," Oestreicher said. 
So far, the most serious side effect of DDC has been pain in the nerves of the 
feet and hands. About 10% of patients eventually have to stop therapy because 
of side effects, Oestreicher said.
