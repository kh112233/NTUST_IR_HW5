METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $2,500 IN BOGUS BILLS FOUND ON PLAYGROUND 
Federal agents recovered $2,500 in "mediocre" counterfeit bills found "blowing 
in the Santa Ana winds" Wednesday on a playground at Crenshaw High School in 
South Los Angeles, officials said. 
"The quality of the bills, in denominations of $20s, $50s and $100s, were 
mediocre and nothing to shout about," said Jim Miller, special agent in charge 
of the U.S. Secret Service's Los Angeles office. Students returned an 
additional $600 after the principal made an announcement, Miller said. 
The money, found blowing around between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., "obviously didn't 
appear out of the sky, but we don't have any witnesses who saw it being dropped 
there," he said.
