LOCAL; 
VANDAL BELIEVED RESPONSIBLE FOR DERAILMENT IN WESTMINSTER 
A vandal who flipped a switch on a train track apparently caused two 
locomotives and two boxcars carrying thousands of rounds of artillery shells to 
derail Tuesday night in Westminster, railroad officials said this morning. 
The Southern Pacific train, called the Huntington Beach Switcher, was at the 
crossing at Hoover Street about two miles from Seal Beach Naval Weapons 
Station, heading toward Anaheim, when the locomotives and cars slipped off the 
track. 
"All the cars were upright, although some were leaning. None of the ammunition 
was damaged in any way," said Southern Pacific spokesman Jim Loveland. "There 
were no detonators aboard, so there was no real risk of explosion. No railroad 
carries live stuff." 
Westminster officials were close to evacuating about 1,000 people in the area, 
including a nearby hospital and several retirement homes, after the 6:35 p.m. 
accident. But they decided against the precaution when naval ordnance experts 
determined the cargo was undamaged. 
Aboard the two derailed cars were 2-foot long, 5-inch diameter, 38-caliber 
shells, which are shot from guns aboard battleships. 
Early this morning, the two stranded but undamaged boxcars were towed back to 
the Seal Beach station, where the ammunition was to be stored until it can be 
shipped out again. 
By dawn today, about 15 green-helmeted Southern Pacific workers were repairing 
300 feet of twisted rails and torn railway ties at Westminster Boulevard and 
Hoover Street. Using a crane-like device, they hoisted the damaged rail and 
pulled broken ties from underneath. 
Southern Pacific road master Larry Magathan, who was supervising the repairs, 
said new rails and ties were on the way. He predicted that the rails would be 
repaired by Friday. 
"Right now, we think it is vandalism," said Bill Currier, a superintendent with 
Southern Pacific. "We think they tampered with a switch."
