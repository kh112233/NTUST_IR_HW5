SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 An application for a scientific research permit has been submitted by Scripps Institute of Oceanography, Institute
for Geophysics and Planetary Physics, Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate Program, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla,
CA 920930225. 


On November 16, 1993, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60426) that a request for a scientific research permit (P557) was submitted, to take by incidental harassment,
the following species of marine mammals for purposes of scientific research in waters off the northern coast of Kauai,
Hawaii: humpback whale (

Megaptera novaeangliae

), sperm whale (

Physeter macrocephalus

), pygmy sperm whale (

Kogia breviceps

), short-finned pilot whale (

Globicephala macrorhynchus

), Cuvier's beaked whale (

Ziphius cavirostris

), Baird's beaked whale (

Berardius bairdii

), Blainville's beaked whale (

Mesoplodon densirostris

), spinner dolphin (

Stenella longirostris

), spotted dolphin (

Stenella attenuata

), false killer whale (

Pseudorca crassidens

), rough-toothed dolphin (

Steno bredanensis

), bottlenose dolphin (

Tursiops truncatus

), and monk seal (

Monachus schauinslandi

). 
On February 17, 1994, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 7983) that a modification to the above scientific research permit application (P557) was submitted to request
incidental harassment of sea turtles, and additional species of marine mammals which have only occasionally been
observed in Hawaiian waters. 
On March 10, 1994, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 11254) that a public hearing would be held on this scientific research permit application (P557) (and on scientific
research permit application P557A). This hearing was held in Silver Spring, Maryland. 
Application P557 is a request to allow harassment of marine mammals and sea turtles by low frequency (70 Hz) sound sources
at depths of 850900m. This source is part of the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) program, and is
proposed to be operated from March 1994 through December 1995 off Hawaii. The maximum duty cycle will be 8%, with a transmission
bandwidth of 20 Hz at a level of 195 dB (re 1 uPa at 1m), and with a spectrum level for the peak frequency (70 Hz) at 182 dB.
The effects of these transmissions on marine mammals and sea turtles will be monitored through a variety of methods.

The subject permit is requested under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended 
(16 U.S.C. 1361 

et seq

.), the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.), and the regulations governing the taking, 
importing, and exporting of endangered fish and wildlife 
(50 CFR part 222).
