FT  10 JUN 94 / CrossRail backer confident of revival
London Transport, a backer of the Pounds 2bn CrossRail project to build an
underground rail link between east and west London, said yesterday that it
was confident the venture could be revived.
CrossRail was rejected last month by the four-MP committee studying the
proposal under the Commons private bill procedure.
London Transport, co-promoter with British Rail, believes it will find
enough backing in parliament for a motion to send the proposal back to the
committee.
Mr David Lidington, MP for Aylesbury, one of the towns which would be linked
to CrossRail, is working to obtain signatures for a motion to revive the
bill. If there is sufficient backing it could be put to the Commons after it
reassembles on Tuesday.
The CrossRail project team is willing to revise the proposal to create
connections with the Heathrow Express service from Paddington in west London
and with the Channel tunnel rail link at Stratford in east London. Links
could be established with other routes such as the London-Tilbury-Southend
and the Northampton lines.
London Transport expects the London economy to improve so that most of the
job losses which occurred during the recession will be made good, justifying
the building of the link.
London Transport has spent just more than Pounds 100m on CrossRail and is
continuing to spend at the rate of Pounds 1m a month. It believes that
private partners could be persuaded to provide between 40 per cent and 50
per cent of the finance.
A consultant calculated, however, that private investors would be willing to
provide only between a quarter and a third of the funds required. He said
the project needed to be re-designed to provide a cheaper, more
cost-effective link.
London Transport expects to announce later this month that it made an
operating profit, before restructuring costs, of Pounds 5m in the year ended
March 31, its best result in 10 years. It made a loss of Pounds 77m in the
previous year.
