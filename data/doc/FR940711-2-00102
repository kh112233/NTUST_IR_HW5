Anti-Retroviral Compounds 


Tam, S., Weigle, M., Broder, S., Mitsuya, H. (NCI) 
Serial No. 07/064,631 
Patent Reissued 14 Apr 92 
U.S. Patent No. Re 33,887 



Dimeric dideoxynucleosides formed from two different 2
&rsquo;,3
&rsquo;- dideoxynucleosides joined by a linking group are useful for treatment of HIV-infection and other retroviral
infections. The linked dideoxynucleosides specifically inhibit HIV replication in vitro with less toxicity in
human cells. Methods for the synthesis of these compounds are provided. 


Method of Inhibiting Viral Replication Using IL10 


Yarchoan, R., Saville, W., Tosato, G., Taga, K. (NCI)
Filed 24 May 93
Serial No. 08/066,785 



The use of recombinant human interleukin 10 (rhIL10) has been discovered to be a new potential means of treating
HIV infection. In vitro studies with rhIL10 have shown it to be an inhibitor of HIV infection in human monocytes
and macrophages as well as having activity against HIV in certain T-cell and monocyte cell lines. This activity against
HIV occurs both at the time of infection and when added to previously infected cell cultures. 
These effects occur at IL10 concentrations that are lower than those which inhibit other immune functions.
In addition, the use of IL10 to interfere with HIV replication is expected to result in the amelioration of Kaposi's
sarcoma. 


Novel Nonpeptidic Retroviral Protease Inhibitors 


Randad, R., Pan, W., Burt, S., Erickson, J. (NCI) 
Filed 8 Aug 93 
Serial No. 08/106,686 



Novel nonpeptidic compounds designed to be inhibitors of the HIV protease enzyme have been discovered. These compounds
thus have potential as possible pharmaceutical compositions for the inhibition HIV replication and the treatment
of AIDS. Based upon SS isomers of substituted dibenzyl-5-hydroxyl-2-primidones, these compounds are expected
to not have the problems associated with current peptide-based protease inhibitors such as poor oral absorption,
poor stability, and rapid metabolism and elimination. 


Use of Peptomers Derived From HIV1 and HIV2 as Vaccine Candidates 


Robey, F., Harris-Kelson, T., Robert-Guroff, M. (NIDR) 
Filed 19 Jan 94 
Serial No. 08/184,330 



Novel conformationally constrained peptide polymer HIV vaccine candidates have been uncovered that generate a
strong humoral immune response not seen against monomeric peptides. Termed ``peptomers'', these candidates are
composed of specifically cross-linked synthetic peptide sequences from the highly conserved CD4 binding domains
of the gp120 regions of HIV1 

and

 HIV2. Although peptides from these regions of gp120 do not possess any conformation in solution, the polymerized
forms were found to have conformations that resemble the theoretical conformations that might be found in these regions
of the native gp120 from HIV1 and HIV2. Certain peptomers from HIV1 and HIV2 bind CD4, the
cell receptor for HIV1 and HIV2, and induce antibody responses in rabbits and rhesus monkeys that block
in vitro HIV1 infection.
