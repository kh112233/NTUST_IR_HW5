Most Terrible Diseases"] 
  [Text] Yaroslav Novytskyy, a Lvov scientist, has created a 
preparation based upon celandine [Latin: Chelidonium majus] -- a 
biennial herb of the poppy family -- for the treatment of cancer 
and AIDS. The scientist first used it to treat his brother, who 
had cancer, and cured him. Unable to implement his plans in his 
own fatherland, Ya. Novytskyy had to emigrate to Austria, where 
he continued his research. It proved a success: On the basis 
of celandine, an even more effective medicinal preparation, 
Ukrayinian, was obtained. 
  The scientist's invention has been patented in many 
countries 
of the world. Major pharmaceutical firms and companies are 
offering the inventor a lot of money for the patent to produce 
this preparation, but he is in no hurry. Last year, Ukrayinian 
was successfully tested at the Kiev Medical Institute.
