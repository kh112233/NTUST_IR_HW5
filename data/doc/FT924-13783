FT  14 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Kyrgyzstan in dam talks with GE
The government of Kyrgyzstan is in preliminary talks with General Electric
of the US to build a hydroelectric dam on the Naryn River, in the south of
the country near its border with China, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
Mr Sulunduk Kazakov, deputy economy minister, said a preliminary 'agreement'
had been reached with GE on a complex of dams at Kambarata, costing Dollars
100m (Pounds 56.1m). But GE's Moscow office said last night the talks were
at an early stage, with further meetings set for later this year at the
group's hydroelectric headquarters in Canada.
The republic, which exports electricity to China, produces 13bn KW/hours of
electricity a year, and could produce 140bn.
