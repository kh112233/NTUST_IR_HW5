  [Excerpts] Turkey once again has provoked Greece. 
According to an ATHENS NEWS AGENCY dispatch from Ankara, the 
Turkish newspaper MILLIYET today carries an interview with 
Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who maintains that the 12 
miles [territorial waters] in the Aegean are casus belli for 
Turkey. It is noted that Turkey has not yet signed the 
international treaty on the Law of the Sea. [passage omitted] 
  Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made the following 
statement when asked to comment on remarks by Turkish Prime 
Minister Tansu Ciller: Greece has its well-known sovereign 
rights, which it exercises within the framework of this discreet 
freedom. Mr. Venizelos further noted that the government 
refuses to collaborate in cultivating a climate of artificial 
tension with Turkey, and said that he feels it is not expedient 
to make another statement while Mr. Karolos Papoulias is 
visiting Istanbul, where he is attending the spring conference 
of the NATO foreign ministers and will meet with his Turkish 
counterpart, Hikmet Cetin.
