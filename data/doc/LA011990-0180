AIR PASSENGER BODY CALLS FOR SECURITY LEVY: $1 PER TICKET 
An organization that represents airline passengers today called for a $1 levy 
on all air tickets to finance a $1-billion program to improve airline security 
and fight terrorism. 
Geoffrey Lipman, secretary-general of the International Foundation for Airline 
Passengers, said such a fund would contribute toward research into more 
sophisticated security technology and improved training of airline staff, 
particularly in Third World countries. 
He cited a survey by the foundation that showed that 80% of travelers 
questioned would support such a charge on tickets. The proposed fund would 
supplement existing security expenditures by governments and airlines, Lipman 
added. 
Some U.S. airlines, such as Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, add $5 to the cost 
of a transatlantic ticket to cover security screening for international 
flights.
