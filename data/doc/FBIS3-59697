<H5>  1. Technological Development in Electric Power Enterprises </H5>
  The thinking that economic development, stabilized energy 
supply and the protection of environment are inseparable is 
spreading in many sectors. The problem of environment is being 
grasped from a global standpoint comprising the conservation of 
natural resources. The significance of the environment is being 
recognized in all aspects of social life. 
  In the meantime, the demand and supply of energy are tending 
to increase in long-term prospects although accurate prediction 
is rendered difficult due to the uncertain behavior of economies 
under recession and the change of industrial structures. The 
electric utility enterprises, which will play a vital role in 
the future supply of electric power, are working for the 
development of new electric power sources and expanded exchange 
of electric power among electric companies of different regions. 
  The Central Electric Power Council, meanwhile, has 
enumerated 
as important subjects of technological development technology 
for protecting the environment, nuclear power generation 
technology, coal thermal power generation technology, power 
transmission network technology and technology for effective 
energy utilization and new energy in its ``Electric Power 
Technology Development Program.'' Fuel cell power generation is 
defined as one of the main themes of the above-mentioned 
``technology for effective energy utilization and new energy'' 
to be pursued hereafter by electric power companies. 
  Incidentally, the costs for promoting technological 
development during FY 1993 are estimated at about &yen;218,200 
million divided among 10 electric power companies, Electric 
Power Development Co., Ltd., the Japan Atomic Power Co. and the 
Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (Figure 1).

<H5>  2. Development and Introduction of Fuel Cells </H5>
  The electric power industry in Japan has been consistently 
pursuing the development and introduction of fuel cells from the 
standpoint of effective utilization of energy and protection of 
the global environment. Following is an outline of research and 
development efforts by electric utility companies. 
<H5>  (1) Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells (PAFC) </H5>
  Phosphoric acid fuel cells are moving from the stage of 
basic 
development to that of practical applications. R&amp;D have been 
conducted incessantly in the electric power industry for the 
past 10 years (Table 1).

*TPS = Thermal Power Station 


  The electric power industry formulated in 1991 the New 
Energy 
Introduction Project for promoting the practical application of 
new energy including solar photovoltaic power and wind power 
with a target of generating more than 1 million kW of new energy 
by the year 2000. As for fuel cells, the industry plans to 
introduce about 37 units centering on small-capacity models 
(50-200kW) throughout the country for the time being for 
collecting basic data on operation, maintenance and heat 
utilization and thereby to expedite their early commercial 
application. 
  Based on this program, Shikoku Electric Power Co., Inc., the 
Hokuriku Electric Power Co., Inc., Chubu Electric Power Co., 
Inc. and Tohoku Electric Power Co., Inc. started operation 
research in FY92, giving a fresh impetus to the progress of the 
project. 
  Furthermore, Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. and Central 
Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, under contract 
with the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, installed on 
Rokko Island, Kobe, an on-site fuel cell unit consisting of 
fourteen 50-kW units and one 200-kW unit with total output of 
900-kW combined with solar photovoltaic and wind power 
generation systems. Research is directed at the solution of 
technical problems during the linkage of dispersed-type power 
sources with the power grid. 
  As for large-capacity units, Tokyo Electric Power Co., Inc. 
(TEPCO) constructed the world's largest 11,000-kW class plant on 
the premises of Goi Thermal Power Station based on the technical 
data of the operation research conducted with a 4,500-kW pilot 
plant until 1985. The new plant started operation in 1991. 
  PAFC Technology Research Association, established jointly by 
gas and electric power companies, is conducting research on the 
improvement of PAFC with subsidies provided by the Agency of 
Natural Resources and Energy. The purpose is to introduce PAFC 
power plant in practical use at an early date. The Research 
Association is developing a 5,000-kW pressurized plant and 
1,000-kW ambient pressure plant with power generation efficiency 
of over 42&percnt; and featuring low cost, high reliability and 
compactness in a six-year program from 1991 to 1996. 
  The above-mentioned 5,000-kW plant has been designed based 
on 
the operation data obtained from two 1,000-kW plants developed 
by Kansai Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power as a national 
project since 1987. New project has started after the evaluation 
of the previous data and mapping out the plan for the next step 
by the Central Electric Power Council. 
<H5>  (2) Molten Carbonate Fuel-cells (MCFC) </H5>
  Molten carbonate fuel cells are expected to be promising 
alternative power sources to thermal power plants since coal gas 
can be employed with high efficiency. The development of MCFC 
has been led by MCFC Technology Research Association in the 
framework of the New-Sunshine (former Moonlight) Project and 
centered on elementary research such as the development of 
peripheral equipment of cell stacks and reformers. Ten electric 
power companies became members of the association in May 1993 to 
take part in the development project of a 1,000-kW class pilot 
plant (external reforming type) to be started in the second half 
of this year, based on the governmental interim evaluation. In 
addition, electric power companies are conducting basic research 
and surveys separately. Kansai Electric Power and Mitsubishi 
Electric Corp. have been conducting, for example, joint 
operation research of a 100-kW class stack of indirect internal 
reforming type since May 1992. 
<H5>  (3) Solid Oxide Fuel Cells </H5>
  The development of solid oxide fuel cells in Japan is at a 
stage of elementary research for stacks with an output of 
200-1,000kW. They are ranked as promising fuel cells of the next 
generation following PAFC and MCFC. 
  The electric power industry is accumulating technical data 
through basic research and operation tests, and is also 
conducting surveys on research trends and themes in Japan and 
abroad. 
  TEPCO has been conducting joint R&amp;D with Mitsubishi 
Heavy 
Industries, Ltd. since 1986 and carried out generation tests of 
a 1-kW stack, to which Electric Power Development Co. later 
joined. Chubu Electric Power and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries 
have jointly developed a 1-kW stack of monoblock layer built 
type. 
  Furthermore, Kansai Electric Power, in a joint project with 
Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and Westinghouse of the U.S., has developed 
a 25-kW cell system, the largest solid oxide fuel cell unit so 
far in the world. Operation research has been conducted for this 
plant installed in the New Energy Testing Center of Kansai 
Electric on Rokko Island since April 1992. 
<H5>  3. Tasks for Practical Use of Fuel Cells </H5>
  As mentioned above, the government and the electric power 
industry are conducting research and collecting data in various 
forms for the development of fuel cells. Numerous tasks are 
still necessary before fuel cells can be practically applied and 
introduced as generation systems of electric utility enterprises. 
<H5>  (1) Higher Performance and Longer Service Life </H5>
  The performance of modern fuel cells has already attained a 
current density of 200-250mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and an output 
density of 0.13-0.16W/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  under ambient pressure and 
200-300 mA/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;  and 0.15-0.22A/cm&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; 
respectively, in pressurized state. The emphasis is expected to 
shift hereafter to longer service life and higher stability 
rather than higher output density. 
  The longest cumulative operating time so far is 18,377 hours 
(as of March 1993) achieved by a 200-kW plant made by IFC of 
America and installed in TEPCO Shibaura Square Building, Tokyo. 
The longest continuous operating time of over 4,000 hours has 
also been established. The reliability of a plant needs constant 
improvement over numerous tests. A service life of over 40,000 
hours is regarded as essential. Present research is targeted at 
this value. Improvement of catalyst performance and technology 
to prevent the loss of electrolyte are awaited to lead to target 
performance. 
<H5>  (2) Cost Reduction </H5>
  Cost is the greatest problem that should be surmounted 
before 
practical application. Cost below &yen;200,000-&yen;250,000 per 
kW is required. This corresponds to about 1/4 to 1/5 of the 
present level of cost. Cost reduction may be achieved through 
higher performance of the cells themselves, simplification and 
compactness of the plant including peripheral equipment, higher 
skill and standardization of manufacturing processes and the 
mass production effect brought about through expanded market. 
<H5>  (3) Compactness </H5>
  The installation space of the equipment is an important 
factor for practical application in Japan with its high land 
prices. Present plants tend to disregard compactness since they 
are mainly intended for research and testing. The 5,000-kW stack 
of PAFC Association occupies an installation space of about 
0.27m&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; /kW. This must be reduced to 1/3 if the system 
is to be competitive with existing gas turbines and gas engines. 
<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  An interim report by the Demand and Supply Subcommittee of 
the Central Electric Power Council in June 1990 estimates that 
the capacity of dispersed-type power sources in the electric 
utility industry will reach 1.1 million kW (of which fuel cells 
will account for 1.05 million kW) by the end of the year 2000, 
and 5.7 million kW (5.5 million kW, ditto) by 2010. 
  Mounting interest in the global environment has also 
attracted general attention to the development and application 
of fuel cells with its potential for environmental protection 
and effective utilization of energy. 
  Under these circumstances, Japan's electric power industry 
intends to make the utmost effort for experimental introduction 
and technology development of phosphoric acid fuel cells for the 
time being. The R&amp;D of advanced-type cells such as molten 
carbonate type and solid oxide type will be stepped up at the 
same time. 
  As regards so-called new energy generation including fuel 
cells, photovoltaic generation and wind power generation, the 
electric power industry is ready to cooperate with users who own 
these facilities and to purchase the surplus power from these 
users, if desired, under certain conditions through links with 
the power grid, so as to positively promote the introduction of 
environment-friendly new energy generation.
