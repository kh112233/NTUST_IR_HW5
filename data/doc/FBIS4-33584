  [Text] Early this morning the leader of the gang that was 
transporting 7.5 metric tons [as heard] of cocaine from 
Tocantins State to Santos, Sao Paulo State, was arrested. 
Colombian Vicentino Junior had spent two days hiding in the 
forest along the Tocantins River's banks. 
  Federal Police now are investigating the gang's links with 
international drug trafficking. The group is believed to be a 
Brazilian branch of the Cali cartel. 
  The eight Brazilians and three Colombians arrested during 
the 
operation will be transferred to Brasilia.
