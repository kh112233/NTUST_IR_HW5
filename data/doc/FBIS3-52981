  [Text] Cairo, 10 Jan (MENA)--Security authorities at Cairo 
Airport this evening thoroughly searched the passengers of a 
Tunisian airliner on both its flights from Cairo to Tunis and 
back. The Tunisian security authorities sent an urgent cable to 
those at Cairo Airport warning that certain terrorists may place 
explosives on the Tunisian airliner on its return flight from 
Cairo to Tunis. The security authorities were notified by the 
Tunisian airlines office at the airport. 
  The security authorities took strict measures. They 
requested that the airliner taxi to a special runway and search 
teams and explosive experts checked the plane and passengers but 
found nothing. The authorities also took the necessary 
protection measures for the plane that took off from Cairo on 
its ordinary flight with 63 passengers.
