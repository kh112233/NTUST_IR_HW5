U.S. FORCES INVADE PANAMA, OUST NORIEGA REGIME 
Until recently, Gen. Manuel Noriega was an asset of the CIA, relied upon for 
assisting U.S. counterinsurgency operations in Central America. He has 
consistently been repressive and corrupt. Yet, only when he became a liability 
for U.S. policy in 1987 did the U.S. government turn against him. 
Now President Bush -- who as CIA director was aware of our relationship with 
Noriega -- authorizes the invasion of Panama to impose U.S. foreign (and 
internal political) interests once again. In stark contrast to the dramatic 
peaceful changes sweeping throughout Eastern Europe, Bush's use of military 
force to overthrow Noriega sets a very bad profile for the United States. 
U.S. military forces should be withdrawn from Panama immediately, in favor of 
diplomatic actions by the United Nations or the Organization of American 
States.
