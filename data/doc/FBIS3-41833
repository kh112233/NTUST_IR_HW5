  [Text] The lack of basic sanitation in over 90 
percent of Brazil's municipalities has caused the return of 
cholera and leprosy, which would have been prevented with clean 
water. 
  The dream has ended. A year after having served as the site 
of the UN Conference on Environment and Development, Brazil is 
confronting the most insidious type of attack on the 
environment: the tragedy of poverty. Diseases considered 
eradicated, such as cholera and leprosy, are returning, exposing 
a reality quite different from the ideals of a healthy life 
preached at Rio-92. The Brazilian basic sanitation system is a 
failure, and has caused the country to spend billions of dollars 
to combat illnesses that could easily have been avoided with a 
mere supply of sewers and clean water. 
  According to the health expert, Paulo Buss, vice president 
of 
education and training at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Fiocruz, 
Brazil's poverty is responsible for the resurgence of five of 
the world's seven oldest plagues: malaria, leprosy, 
leishmaniasis, tuberculosis, and cholera. He claims that the 
deeper the Brazilian recession, the larger the number of 
inhabitants vulnerable to these diseases becomes. According to 
the Fiocruz studies, malaria has already reached the level of 
530,000 cases per year, concentrated in the States of Amazonas 
and Para. Tuberculosis, on the other hand, has totaled 80,000 
cases, distributed throughout the entire territory. 
  Although it failed to evoke the interest of Brazilian 
diplomats, the problem was not ignored at the 1992 meeting. In 
the Health Charter, the principal document produced at the 
parallel conference on environment, health, and development, 
health specialists from all over the world warned of the 
relationship between the inequitable income in Brazil and short 
life expectancy at birth. They claimed that the high perinatal 
and infant mortality rate could be explained by the difficulty 
in gaining access to quality preventive and remedial health 
services. 
  The cholera epidemic is another example of this 
relationship. 
Studies show that most of the 8,000 cases reported this year 
affected the population group earning less than two minimum 
wages. The health experts explain why poverty is an ecological 
problem as well: "Both extreme poverty and extreme wealth are 
associated with predatory use of natural resources, resulting in 
dissipation, pollution, and environmental deterioration." 
According to the document, hasty solutions almost always have 
ephemeral results, often ultimately causing new problems even 
more difficult to solve. 
  Brazil is the champion of ephemeral solutions. During the 
year of Rio-92, the public sector spent nearly $11 billion in an 
attempt to cure the immense contingent of sick Brazilians. Over 
560 billion cruzeiros were spent on consultations at hospitals 
and health stations run by the federal, state, or municipal 
governments, resulting in 13.6 million hospital confinements. 
  In 80 percent of the consultations and 65 percent of the 
hospital confinements, the fundamental cause of the gigantic 
first-aid facility that Brazil has become is just one: the lack 
of basic sanitation. It is estimated that, each year, the 
government spends $2.5 million treating illnesses directly 
caused by the extremely bad conditions under which most of the 
Brazilian population lives. 
  A summary of the poverty (of which hunger is only one 
component) may be observed in a survey conducted by the 
Brazilian Association of Sanitary and Environmental Engineering, 
ABES: 92 percent of Brazil's municipalities lack sewage 
treatment; 59 percent have no final destination for waste; and 
50 percent are without treated water. 
  In the Northern region, where diarrheas rank first on the 
list of diseases with the highest mortality rate, only 2.24 
percent of the population is served by the sewer system. In 
Amazonas, only the capital, Manaus, has the system, and yet it 
is still without suitable treatment.
