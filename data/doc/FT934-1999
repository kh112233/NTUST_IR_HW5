FT  16 DEC 93 / Clark 'starved' of Iraq details
Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister, yesterday told the Scott inquiry
he and other senior politicians had been 'starved' of vital intelligence
material relating to the manufacture of Iraqi arms.
He described how BSA Machines had been prosecuted for exporting automatic
lathes and grinders to make munitions in Iraq even though the company had
the covert support of the authorities.
'The machinery of government had been put into play to make a particular
exception on their behalf and they were later prosecuted,' he said. 'It was
like Kafka, really.'
Giving evidence for the third day to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry into the
export of dual-use goods to Iraq, Mr Clark queried the whole basis of the
Customs case against three employees of Matrix Churchill, who were
prosecuted for illegal exports to Iraq.
The prosecution collapsed after Mr Clark revealed that the government knew
Matrix goods were going to munitions factories and had been encouraging
exporters to stress their 'general' or 'agricultural' use on application
forms. This policy tallied with a letter from Lord Trefgarne, the former
trade minister, to Mr William Waldegrave, the former foreign minister, on
March 30 1990.
Mr Clark said there 'must have been someone who would have seen that text
and 'gulped',' to have seen that the letter argued that the machinery was
for civil engineering purposes, because it was later found to have been
linked to triggers which were parts for the Iraqi supergun.
