  [Text] Pyongyang. April 27 (KCNA) -- Gold medals were 
awarded to "bottom paint SZ 167-ka," "fingerprint access control 
system," "meari electret condenser microphone (ECM-319) for 
professional use" and "multifunctional inoculant for production 
of spheroidal graphite cast iron" and silver medals to "various 
gases absorbent" and "high immunogenic hepatitis B vaccine," 
inventions and new technology products entered by the DPRK at 
the 22nd Geneva international exhibition of inventions, new 
technique and productions. 
  At the awarding ceremony on April 21 the jury said that 
"bottom paint SZ 167-ka" developed by Korean scientists was of 
worldwide significance and when it was introduced into 
shipbuilding, it would greatly contribute to lessening the 
pollution of sea environment, a knotty problem at present. 
  The president of the international federation of inventors' 
associations and scientists and technicians and delegates of 
companies from scores of countries including Switzerland, 
Austria, France, Germany and the United States said that the 
high-tech standard of Korea was beyond imagination. 
  They said the "fingerprint access control system" is 
incomparably superior in speed and accuracy to the U.S. products.
