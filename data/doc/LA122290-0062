STARVATION RULING IN COMA CASE STANDS 
A federal judge refused to order state health officials to resume feeding Nancy 
Cruzan a week after nourishment was halted to the woman, who is in a vegetative 
state. 
Food and water were removed from the patient, 33, at a Mt. Vernon, Mo., 
rehabilitation center. She has been in a coma since suffering massive brain 
damage in a 1983 traffic accident.
