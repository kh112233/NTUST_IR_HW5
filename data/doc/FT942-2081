FT  21 JUN 94 / Tobacco men succeed Miles
Mr Michael Miles, the non-smoking chairman and chief executive of Philip
Morris, the US food and tobacco group, has suddenly quit following a
boardroom rejection of his plan to split the group into separate food and
tobacco companies.
He has been replaced by two men from the tobacco side of the business: Mr
William Murray, who becomes chairman, and Mr Geoffrey Bible, who becomes
president and chief executive. The changes take immediate effect.
Mr Miles was chairman and chief executive of Kraft, the US food company,
when Philip Morris acquired it in 1988, and became chairman and chief
executive of Philip Morris in 1991.
One of the most difficult periods of his tenure came in April 1993 when
Philip Morris cut the price of its best-selling Marlboro cigarettes and
other premier brands to regain market share from low-cost competition,
sending earnings and the share price into a tailspin.
Announcing his decision to go, Mr Miles said he left 'with full confidence
that the difficult decisions made over the past two years will be proven
right by our results in 1994 and beyond'.
However, he said, the recovery of Philip Morris's US tobacco business and
the continued growth in international tobacco meant it made sense for an
executive from the tobacco side to take charge.
