  [Text] Irbil, Iraq, March 14, (AFP)--Two Swedish 
journalists were injured in a car bomb attack near 'Aqrah in the 
Kurdish-controlled region of northern Iraq, Kurdish security 
forces said Monday [14 March]. 
  The two freelances were only slightly hurt in the explosion 
Sunday caused by a bomb packed with TNT attached to their car. 
  No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but the 
Kurdish driver of the car was arrested. 
  Recent attacks on foreigners have been blamed on the Iraqi 
government, opposed to foreign aid for the Kurds in the area, 
set up following the 1991 Gulf war.
