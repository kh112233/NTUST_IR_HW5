A child was killed and her parents were injured when their car crashed into a 
tree and flipped over, Anaheim police said today. 
Elena Tavares, believed to be about 2 or 3 years old, was pronounced dead at 
UCI Medical Center in Orange shortly after the accident. 
Police said the girl suffered massive head injuries.

Both Tavares and his wife, Sonia, received several facial cuts. They are listed 
in stable condition at hospitals in Santa Ana and Garden Grove.
