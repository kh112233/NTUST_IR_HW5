  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn received Hakam Bal'awi, the 
Palestinian president's envoy, at the Royal Court today. 
Bal'awi conveyed to his majesty a message from President Yasir 
'Arafat, in which he explained the difficulties facing the 
negotiations and obstructing the peace process. He stressed 
that the Palestinian leadership always seeks joint action with 
the Arab states in general, and with Jordan in particular. 
  The Palestinian envoy stressed to his majesty that the 
Palestinian leadership appreciates his majesty's concern for the 
Palestine question, and his continuous sincere efforts to 
maintain the Arab identity of Jerusalem, to safeguard the holy 
places in it, and to maintain its Arab and Islamic identity. He 
noted that the Palestinian leadership hopes that his majesty's 
sincere efforts will continue to safeguard the Arab identity of 
Jerusalem. 
  His Majesty King Husayn explained to the Palestinian 
leadership's envoy the historic role Jordan has played over the 
past decades in defending the Palestinian people's rights, as 
well as its persistent efforts to alleviate the suffering of the 
kinsfolk in the occupied homeland and to enable them to attain 
their rights on their national soil. His majesty emphasized 
that his concern for the Arab identity of Jerusalem is a 
historic concern that embodies Jordan's commitment to its 
nation's issues and to safeguarding its rights and the future of 
its generations. 
  Attending the meeting were al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief 
of the Royal Court; Marwan al-Qasim, his majesty's political 
adviser; and al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Palestinian ambassador in
