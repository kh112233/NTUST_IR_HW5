  [Text] Beijing, March 20 (XINHUA) -- China managed to keep 
its birth rate at 19 per thousand last year despite the fact 
that it was a sub-peak year in terms of the number of 
child-bearing age women said an official at a national family 
planning conference here today. 
  According to Peng Peiyun, state councilor and minister in 
charge of the State Family Planning Commission, China has kept 
the birth rate at below 20 per thousand, the internationally 
acknowledged low birth rate, for several years running. 
  She said that in 1993, there were more than 121 million 
women 
in the 20-29 age group, a figure next only to the peak year of 
1992. In the whole of 1993, 21.26 million babies were born for a 
net increase of 13.46 million and the natural growth rate was 
11.45 per thousand. The total population of China was 1.1851 
billion at the end of the year. 
  Statistics show that the birth rate in the ten provinces and 
municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Liaoning, Jilin, 
Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong and Sichuan remained 
lower than 15 per thousand. And nine provinces and autonomous 
regions which are home to ethnic groups also saw a noticeable 
reduction in birth rates. 
  Peng attributed the achievement to the efforts made by the 
government and family planning organizations at all levels. The 
country's fast-growing economy is also changing people's concept 
of births and family.
