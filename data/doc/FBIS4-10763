<F P=106> [Statement by police spokesman Major Cesar Augusto Somoza on </F>
the kidnapping of Deputy Adolfo Alvarado in Olancho Department; 
place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] According to our reports, Alfonso Alvarado was 
kidnapped in San Esteban at 0800 today by three people who 
reportedly wanted to do business with him. His butler, who was 
with Alvarado, left them alone so they could talk. After 20 
minutes, the butler discovered Alvarado had been kidnapped. The 
kidnappers left a note, which Alvarado's relatives took to 
Olancho Regional Commander Lt. Col. Medrano. In the note, 
members of an armed group known as Los Cinchoneros informed Mrs. 
Alvarado that they were foreigners and were demanding a 1.5 
million lempiras ransom, otherwise her husband would be 
executed. The kidnappers drove a red Hilux pickup. The note 
also said that the ransom money should be dropped at a lumber 
mill near San Pedro Sula at 1630 local on Saturday, and that Mr. 
Alvarado would be released at Aguacaliente at 1600 on Sunday. 
The note stipulated that neither the police, the Army, nor 
another country should be told about the kidnapping and that 
counterfeit or marked money should not be delivered. The note 
was signed by a rural commando that fights on behalf of 
exploited people.
