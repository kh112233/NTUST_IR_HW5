  [Text] Qingdao, April 15 (XINHUA) -- East China's port city 
of Qingdao has achieved good economic results through boosting 
its marine industry. 
  Over the past few years the city has been establishing a 
marine industry that includes the development of bio-engineering 
and comprehensive use of aquatic resources. 
  Despite having two-thirds of the marine scientists and 
researchers in China, Qingdao did not start taking advantage of 
its research findings until recently. 
  To tap ocean resources, Qingdao drew up a ten-year 
development plan and formulated preferential policies regarding 
fund raising, loans and tax reductions some years ago. 
  The technology of artificial breeding and raising of prawns 
jointly developed by local research institutions and colleges 
has built up a business with an annual product value of more 
than three billion yuan. 
  Research has also been completed in the breeding and raising 
of abalones. 
  Medication extracted from marine substances have been made 
and have found a growing market. 
  Decay-prevention materials produced by a local chemistry 
institution have been applied to most of the marine-related 
industries nationwide.
