FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Pfizer shares tumble after
profits warning
Shares in Pfizer, until recently the US's highest-flying drugs company,
tumbled again yesterday as the company issued a muted profits warning for
the current quarter.
It also down played the most optimistic expectations of earnings growth for
the year as a whole.
Yesterday's comments, made at an analysts' meeting in New York, also dented
the shares price of other big drug companies, as investors marked down their
expectations of growth in the sector as a whole.
Pfizer first disappointed the market three weeks ago, when it reported a
sharp slowdown in sales growth in the final months of 1993, to 2 per cent.
With a range of new pharmaceuticals launched since 1989, Pfizer had been
expected to do better than its rivals in resisting the effects of price
pressures in drugs markets around the world.
Pfizer's shares dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59 3/8 yesterday. They have
fallen 15 per cent over the past three weeks, wiping Dollars 3bn off the
company's stock market value.
Yesterday, the company said first-quarter results would be 'somewhat
tempered' by the effects of foreign exchange adjustments and higher research
costs. Also, although it said sales growth would be in 'the low double
digits' this year, it added that there would be no immediate sales rebound
after the lacklustre final quarter of 1993.
That had been caused in part by a reduction in inventory levels by drug
wholesalers, but there was no indication inventory levels would rise again,
it added.
The company also said it expected earnings per share for 1994 to be within
market expectations of Dollars 4.10-Dollars 4.25, although it added it was
unlikely to reach the upper end of this range.
Mr William Steere, chairman and chief executive, predicted improvements in
operating profit margins of 1.5 per cent this year, and 2 per cent in each
of the next two years.
