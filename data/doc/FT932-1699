FT  22 JUN 93 / 'Charisma' of Lopez defeats GM's case
CHARISMA alone was enough to persuade seven former General Motors managers
to follow Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua to new jobs at Volkswagen, a
Frankfurt court said yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
Rejecting claims from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, that VW's hiring
the men breached fair competition rules, the court said in a written ruling
that Mr Lopez's colleagues had tried to persuade him to stay with GM.
In the event they needed no urging, having already told him before he
decided to go that they wanted to continue working with him whatever
happened. The court also said that Opel had failed to convince it that any
knowledge its former employees took with them was confidential and could not
be transferred to VW.
Opel still plans to proceed with a full hearing on the case, and, meanwhile,
investigations are continuing into possible charges of industrial espionage
against Mr Lopez and his associates.
