HIGH-ENERGY DISPUTE 
In the spirit of their 19th-Century predecessors, today's neo-Luddites such as 
Jeremy Rifkin and his ilk are not out to protect nature or the environment; 
they are out to destroy science and technology ("Fear of Fusion" by Paul 
Ciotti, April 19). 
For decades they have called for sacrificing the quality of human life made 
possible by the abundance of natural energy sources for the sake of fish, trees 
and inanimate nature. If the preservation of nature were their concern, one 
would think that they would enthusiastically welcome the discovery of the 
process of cold fusion, which could provide a source of clean, pollution-free 
energy. 
In reality, they react quite differently: An inexhaustible energy source would 
give man the ability to destroy the planet's "fragile balance," Rifkin argues. 
In the pre-industrial age to which Rifkin wishes to return us, the average life 
expectancy was 30 years, and the "excess" population was wiped out by periodic 
famines and plagues. This is still the case in the non-industrialized parts of 
the world, such as Ethiopia. Rifkin's argument bespeaks not of a love of 
nature, but of a profound hatred for man and for any human progress that has 
been made beyond that sorry state.
