  [Text] Pretoria May 3 SAPA -- State president-elect Nelson 
Mandela and outgoing President F W de Klerk met at the Union 
Buildings in Pretoria on Tuesday [3 May], a spokesman for the Mr 
de Klerk's office said. He said the meeting was private and he 
did not expect the two men to make statements. 
  Mr de Klerk said on Monday evening he would hand over the 
presidency to Mr Mandela on Tuesday next week. 
  It is understood the two leaders will discuss the National 
Party's [NP] role in the Government of National Unity being 
formed in terms of the constitution. 
  Mr de Klerk, as leader of the second biggest party, is 
entitled to one of the two executive deputy presidencies. 
  For each five per cent of the national vote gained by the 
NP, 
the party will be entitled to one cabinet seat. The NP, with 
just over more 20 per cent of the vote, will be entitled to four 
cabinet seats. 
  Likely contenders for the cabinet places are serving 
ministers, among them Minister of Constitutional Development 
Roelf Meyer, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha, Minister of 
Finance Derek Keys, Minister of Public Enterprises Dawie de 
Villiers and Minister of Manpower Leon Wessels.
