LOCAL; 
2 HURT IN CARBON CANYON CAR CRASH 
A three-car collision left two people injured, one seriously, and forced the 
closure of Carbon Canyon Road in Brea for two hours this morning, backing up 
rush hour traffic for several miles, authorities said. 
Alva Svoboda of Brea was seriously injured after his car collided head on with 
a van at 7:45 a.m., Brea Police Lt. James Winder said. 
Svoboda, 55, was driving eastbound on Carbon Canyon Road near the Carbon Canyon 
Regional Park when his car veered into the opposing traffic lane and crashed 
into the van driven by Judith Lynn Gober, 29, of Chino, Winder said. After 
being hit by Svoboda, her van was hit from behind by a pickup being driven by 
her husband, Bryan Gober. 
Winder said Svoboda suffered severe internal injuries and was airlifted to 
UCI-Medical Center in Orange. Judith Gober was taken to Brea Community 
Hospital, where she was treated for moderate injuries.
