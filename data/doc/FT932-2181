FT  19 JUN 93 / Property: Big house, low price, the charm of Ireland -
Gerald Cadogan finds a wealth of choice in a relaxed environment
GO TO Ireland for a holiday, and you may stay for life. Many Georgian houses
still lurk behind estate walls, at prices that are attractive to UK buyers.
Although the acres may be fewer than they were 100 years ago, because land
has been sold off to pay bills - or the Land Commission has redistributed it
 -you should have no difficulty finding a fine property.
Perhaps an 18th century house - or an 18th-century-style house built in the
19th century, with stable yard, outbuildings, walled garden, land and
fishing may be to your taste. Even with 6 per cent purchase tax, there is
more for your money in Ireland - and no domestic rates or council tax.
If you like a different pace of life, Ireland has masses to see and do.
Although the numbers of British visitors has fallen in recent years, do not
be afraid if you are English. The insoluble saga of Northern Ireland has an
extremely limited effect on day-to-day life in the republic.
The economy looks to be climbing slowly out of recession and, after a
traumatic spell in the wake of the British pound's devaluation, the Irish
punt has settled at so close to par with the pound that we can show the
guide prices with a Pounds sign that holds for both countries.
Interest rates are down and, as in Britain, devaluation has given farmers
more Green Punts through the EC's payments. Farmland prices are holding up
well.
The Irish country house market was buoyed during the UK property boom as
English buyers saw what good value Ireland offered. With heavy falls in
prices during last year and the early part of this, it is even better value.
Travel between Heathrow and Dublin has improved with three companies (Aer
Lingus, BA and British Midland) competing for travellers, while EC grants
are financing new major roads.
This makes it feasible to live in Ireland and commute to England for,
perhaps, a shortened office week. One might also be able to work from home
by fax or modem, and realise a considerable saving compared with buying a
similar house in, for example, Hampshire.
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, together with Hamilton Osborne King (HOK), is selling
Rathmore Park in Co Carlow by auction on Friday at a disclosed reserve of
just Pounds 230,000 for a Georgian house with park, stables and fishing on
the Slaney. A higher price will be no surprise. Last week HOK sold the
Georgian-style Coolclogher House in Co Kerry at auction at Pounds 420,000,
as against an expected Pounds 300,000-Pounds 350,000, attracting domestic
and foreign bidders.
Auctions are regular in Ireland and do not carry the 'it could not sell
privately' stigma - as can happen in the UK. The auction reveals which
people are really interested in the property. If it has not sold, they can
be approached afterwards for private negotiations. If it does sell, there is
the advantage that everybody knows the price.
The most expensive house on sale in Ireland is a Georgian stately manor with
reception rooms designed by Robert Adam and a remarkable collection of Asian
conifers and rhododendrons. Headfort House at Kells in County Meath is a
convenient 40 miles from Dublin, with 860 acres including 11 cottages, a
shoot and fishing on the Blackwater. This great house is now leased to a
prep school. The buyer can move into a wing, but will have to wait five
years for the whole of the big house, which Keane Mahony Smith (KMS) offers
at Pounds 4m.
Much cheaper is Avonmore House near Dublin in Co Wicklow at Pounds 1.75m
from HOK. It is a lovely Georgian house with ornate plasterwork and comes
with a heated swimming pool and stable yard with 18 boxes. And Pounds 1m
secures the Noan estate of 550 acres (again a Georgian house) in Co
Tipperary, from KMS in Cork and Jackson-Stops &amp; McCabe.
A rare Georgian house near Howth at the north end of Dublin Bay, with a fine
windswept, seaside garden and 10 acres in all, is Drumleck which Lisney
offers at around Pounds 1.5m. In Co Galway in the west Heaslip is selling
Clydagh House at Headford on Lough Corrib, which still has free fishing for
salmon and trout. The Georgian house has 146 acres for around Pounds
750,000.
Near Mullingar in Co Westmeath and convenient for Dublin is Gigginstown, an
1840s Georgian delight in grey stone and white paint, set in parkland. It is
not overwhelming - Robert Ganly, of Ganly Walters, agents with Strutt &amp;
Parker calls it 'a grand honest house' - but it does have fine plasterwork
and a main staircase that splits into two at the half-landing. The vendor,
who is leaving after 58 years there, says she is 'lucky to have been a
tenant for life' and looks for a sympathetic buyer. The price is around
Pounds 580,000.
In the Troubles in the early 1920s big houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy
were burnt down - a powerful theme in the writings of Molly Keane and
William Trevor. I had assumed that they were left as ruins. Wrong. The
government gave compensation (as today in Northern Ireland) and some were
rebuilt in a 1920s Georgian style embellished with Bauhaus or Art Deco
touches. Molly Kean describes one in Loving and Giving. 'As you see,
everything straight from Harrods - the Customs must have been enormous.'
These large houses tried to assert the old regime. Today, like the huge
princely palaces in India built in the 1920s-1940s, their symbolism seems an
irony of history. But they are intriguing homes. Ganly Walters and Jordan
has recently sold Saunders Grove, at Baltinglass, Co Wicklow, for Pounds
750,000, about 9 per cent below the guide price. Now Gunne offers Milestown
at Castlebellingham in Co Louth, north of Dublin on the way to Belfast, a
house of solid comfort in tip-top shape with gardens running down to the
river Glyde, at more than Pounds 500,000.
Ireland has a good supply of large-ish houses in the Pounds 200,000-Pounds
400,000 range, as the agents will be happy to tell you. One, Weir House,
which is splendidly placed on Woodstown Beach with views over Waterford
Harbour, is offered by JSM and Palmer Rohan for more than Pounds 200,000.
Some are glebe houses, the Irish term for old rectories of the (Anglican)
Church of Ireland (not of the Roman Catholics) as at Moyglare outside
Maynooth in Co Kildare, on sale for around Pounds 400,000 from JSM with
Coonan.
Castles are also integral to Irish life, reflecting the endless troubles the
island has suffered. Mount Nugent in Co Cavan is a restored 16th century
tower house (keep) offered by JSM and Armstrong at over Pounds 200,000, with
17 acres, two cottages and a jetty on Lough Sheelin. Priced at Pounds
700,000 is the romantic-looking Cloghan Castle in Co Offaly with duck
shooting on the nearby Shannon, from JSM.
Two other fairytale castles are the firm's Strancally Castle (1820s built by
the Pain brothers) in Co Waterford (Pounds 800,000-Pounds 850,000), and
Dromore in Co Kerry, with fishing on the Blackwater and netting in the
Kenmare. HOK and Cheveley Johnston suggest a price around Pounds 400,000.
The Mill House on the River Slaney at Clonegal, Bunclody in Co Wexford is an
idyll. Water races through the rapids outside the 18th century woollen mill
and still turns the wheel. I sat in the picture window of the old weaving
loft and watched the river. Sitting longer, I should have seen kingfishers
and herons, and last week a pair of otters played on the other bank.
The grounds are wooded and rocky with rare azaleas and rhododendrons. The
only noise is the river. Ganly Walters, Strutt &amp; Parker and JSM offer this
paradise at Pounds 325,000.
