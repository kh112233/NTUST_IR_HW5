  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has called for 
the resignation of Home Affairs Minister Danie Schutte. The 
organization says Schutte must go because of his inability to 
stop right-wingers from operating radio station. 
  ANC northern [Orange] Free State Branch Chairman (Johannes 
Tlali) has condemned the establishment of the right-wing Radio 
Koppies [small hills] in his area. The station has been on the 
air for about a month. Radio Pretoria is continuing broadcasts 
this week despite the expiry of its temporary license, and Radio 
Vryheid [freedom] has been set up near Bloemfontein. (Tlali) 
says Schutte seems unable, or unwilling to deal with the 
stations. He has called on the Transitional Executive Council 
to set up the independent broadcasting authority as soon as 
possible to control all broadcasting frequency bands without 
bias.
