FT  05 JAN 94 / Companies plan to hire more graduates
Companies are planning to increase graduate recruitment this year for the
first time since 1989, the Association of Graduate Recruiters said
yesterday.
Its survey of 271 large recruiters found that 7 per cent more graduates will
be offered jobs this year than in 1993. Only 4 per cent of employers have
any plans to cut recruitment over the next three years, while 39 per cent
expect increases.
But the sharp rise in university enrolment over the past five years means
that more new graduates will be unemployed this year than at the end of
1993.
The strong supply of graduates is also likely to prevent any significant
increase in starting salaries.
Employers began boosting recruitment programmes during 1993 as optimism
about the economy increased, and graduate recruitment ended only 3.5 per
cent lower than in 1992. At the start of 1993, employers had expected a fall
of 21 per cent, following a cut of 14 per cent in 1992.
Mrs Kate Orebi Gann, recruitment manager for Marks and Spencer and chairman
of the association, said many companies needed extra recruits because they
had 'pared to the bone' during the recession.
'Once more organisations start to prepare for the recovery, this improvement
in graduate recruitment should accelerate. The country cannot afford the
waste of talent evident over the last few years,' said Mrs Orebi Gann.
Traditional heavy recruiters, such as chartered accountants and management
consultants, are expected to step up recruitment, but there will be no
return to the levels of the mid-1980s, she said.
Industry has borne the brunt of cuts in recruitment, and is recovering more
slowly than other sectors. In 1993, industry recruitment fell by 18.6 per
cent, a faster fall than in 1992, while the average for all other sectors
was a 1.4 per cent increase.
Industrial companies are also less optimistic for the future, planning a
recruitment rise of only 4 per cent this year.
Students leaving university this year still face a harder fight to find a
job. Vice-chancellors expect the total number graduating to increase by 14
per cent, double the 7 per cent rise projected in the number of vacancies
for them to fill.
The median starting salary paid to graduates last year was Pounds 13,004,
only 1.6 per cent higher than in 1992.
For the second year running, this was less than half the increase in average
earnings over the same period. For this year, starting salaries are expected
to rise to Pounds 13,500, an increase of 3.8 per cent.
The average salary now being paid to a graduate recruited in 1990 is Pounds
17,000, although the top 10 per cent are being paid more than Pounds 22,000.
