BRIEFLY 
Leona Helmsley Loses Appeal: The last obstacle between Leona Helmsley and 
sentencing was lifted when a judge refused to set aside her tax evasion 
conviction. Helmsley, who is portrayed in advertisements as the queen of her 
luxury hotels, was convicted Aug. 30 of evading $1.2 million in federal taxes 
by charging personal expenses to her business empire. By denying a request to 
overturn the conviction and dismiss the charges, U.S. District Judge John 
Walker cleared the way for her Dec. 12 sentencing. The judge ruled that 
prosecutors did not use tainted evidence against Helmsley. Her lawyers alleged 
that prosecutors improperly used the testimony she gave to grand juries in 
1985.
