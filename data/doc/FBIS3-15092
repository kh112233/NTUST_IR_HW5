  [Text] Moscow, 1 Mar -- On 15 January the Federal 
Counter-Intelligence Service halted the espionage activities of 
a senior employee at one of Russia's defense-industry 
enterprises, who had been recruited by the British secret 
services. 
  Criminal proceedings have commenced, ITAR-TASS was told by 
the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. The arrested man was 
charged on 25 January with betrayal of the homeland, to which he 
has confessed in full. 
  Preliminary investigations have provided evidence that the 
accused was provided with special equipment for espionage 
(ciphers and instructions on how to secretly communicate in 
Moscow with intelligence at the British embassy). 
  In return for money, the Russian citizen gathered and passed 
on to the British secret services classified information of a 
military and economic nature.
