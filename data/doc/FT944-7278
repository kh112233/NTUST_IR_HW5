FT  25 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Drug detection on the spot
An enzyme-based drug detection system which can spot minute quantities of
heroin and morphine has been developed by the Institute of Biotechnology in
Cambridge.
The system uses an acetyl esterase enzyme extracted from a bacterium to
convert heroin to morphine, after which the morphine is oxidised using
morphine dehydrogenase, another enzyme. These reactions generate a product
that can be detected using an indicator.
The system is part of a hand-held, air-sampling monitor designed for
on-the-spot screening. The British Technology Group, which has filed patents
on the micro-organism and the enzymes, is seeking commercial partners.
