FT  19 APR 93 / Help not reaching projects in Poland
JUST a quarter of the Dollars 8.6bn of western financing pledged to Poland
in the last three years, or Dollars 2.1bn, had reached public and private
investment projects by the end of last year, according to Poland's Central
Planning Office (CUP).
A CUP study has also pointed to the tying of western government loans to
purchases of equipment from specific countries as the reason for the meagre
draw-down on the Dollars 6.2bn of funds committed in support of Poland's
economic transformation programme.
Of the Dollars 5.3bn of bilateral credit pledged by western governments
since 1990, Dollars 3.6bn was made available and just Dollars 268m spent,
the report says.
In terms of tied loans, Italy was a star performer, with 78 per cent of the
Dollars 468m it said it was prepared to lend having been assigned to
concrete projects. But only 1.5 per cent of Australia's Dollars 200m credit,
which can only be used on Australian wool and hides, was spent.
World Bank disbursement has also been delayed, with Dollars 2.6bn promised
and Dollars 2.2bn committed, yet only Dollars 775m spent. Mr Ian Hume, head
of the World Bank office in Warsaw, said the delays came down to, 'in
essence, an anti-investment climate' in Poland caused by the struggle to
maintain tight monetary policies with high interest rates.
The Ecu224m (Pounds 178m) pledged by the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development to public sector projects has yet to be spent. The study did
not analyse the EBRD's private sector projects in Poland, which amount to
Ecu310m, but their draw-down should be better. Two-thirds of this sum has
been committed to western companies such as Ameritech, ABB or Pilkington
investing in Poland.
