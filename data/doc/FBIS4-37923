<F P=106> [Interview with King Husayn by CNN's Frank Sesno; place and </F>
date not given; from Amman TV's "60 Minutes" program -- 
recorded, in English with Arabic subtitles] 
  [Text] [Husayn] First of all, I believe that President 
Clinton is very interested in progress on the Jordanian-Israeli 
track, but he is also interested in a comprehensive settlement 
which obviously all of us seek. As far as we are concerned, we 
are just about to embark on the real work that requires the best 
efforts of both sides to resolve all the problems. 
  [Sesno] But if you resolve those issues, and they are many, 
but if you were to resolve them before Syria resolves its 
problems, would you sign a deal with Israel then? 
  [Husayn] I would like to say here that we are not tied to 
anything that happens elsewhere, but we are very anxious to see 
all move, and I like us to see a comprehensive peace. So right 
now, we are focusing on our problems and we are going to address 
these problems with all the attention they require, and I don't 
know how long it will take. Maybe Syria will overtake us before 
we complete our task. But nonetheless we are optimistic and 
hopeful. 
  [Sesno] Maybe you will go first? Maybe Jordan will be the 
first? 
  [Husayn] I hope that they will all come together at a point 
in the very early future. 
  [Sesno] A Jordanian official today was quoted as saying that 
you would plan an October meeting here in Washington with Prime 
Minister Rabin to sign a peace treaty. Is that feasible? 
  [Husayn] I honestly don't know. It all depends on what 
happens in the negotiating process which is about to start. But 
as far as meeting with Prime Minister Rabin, it is not a taboo 
subject. We are negotiating on both sides, and we have been 
doing so for quite a while. So I suppose that everything is 
possible at any time in the future. And it will only be the 
natural thing that [words indistinct]. 
  [Sesno] There have been well-reported secret meetings with 
the Israelis for a long time. Why not a public meeting soon? 
  [Husayn] I think that a public meeting is very feasible, and 
it probably won't take long before that happens, but we want to 
see the beginning of the negotiations. I think that meetings at 
the highest possible levels as well help the negotiating process 
and we'll do so in the future. 
  [Sesno] Where would you like to meet the prime minister? 
  [Husayn] I suppose it will either be here or in our part of 
the world. 
  [Sesno] Soon? 
  [Husayn] I hope before too long, yes. 
  [Sesno] The Islamic Action Front in your parliament is very 
much opposed to a deal with Israel at this time. What political 
price would there be in Jordan for a meeting with the Israeli 
prime minister, and really that is most fundamental for real 
progress toward peace or achieving peace at the official level 
with Israel? 
  [Husayn] I think that peace is inevitably coming. The 
process is irreversible. And regardless of how we view matters 
in Jordan from different perspectives, I believe there is a 
great deal of realism there. 
  [Sesno] So you think there would be presumably political 
opposition, but in the end, the vast majority of Jordanians 
would support this process? 
  [Husayn] It all depends on exactly how it works out and on 
what terms. And obviously it's not peace at any price. It is 
the kind of peace that future generations can live with, 
cherish, and protect. 
  [Sesno] How about the Arab boycott of Israel, the economic 
boycott of Israel. Time for that to end, at what point should 
it switch, be switched off? 
  [Husayn] Frank, I think that it is not understood what the 
boycott implies or means. Secondary and tertiary boycotts are 
almost a thing of the past. But we are suffering a boycott from 
Israel, in point of fact. So this is a subject that has to be 
negotiated and resolved. They are a protectionist country in 
terms of their industries against ours. So all this has to be 
worked out and I think [words indistinct]. 
  [Sesno] As you watch the process unfold in Israel between 
Yasir 'Arafat-the PLO and Israel, is Yasir 'Arafat, as you see 
it now, up to governing? 
  [Husayn] It is something that I can't comment on. I hope 
that he is up to it. I've encouraged Palestinians to stick 
together, to express themselves through unity, and I am sure 
that we have many challenges in the future, maybe amongst them 
the need of Palestinian people for democracy, pluralism, respect 
for human rights, and the need for 'Arafat to be the symbol 
leader. But at the same time for institutions to come up to 
enhance the credibility that is required and needed and for him 
to go back as soon as possible. I hope he does that. All these 
concerns raised with him. 
  [Sesno] You told him: Go back soon. 
  [Husayn] I've suggested that, yes. 
  [Sesno] And you believe that Yasir 'Arafat is, at root, a 
democrat and himself respectful of human rights? 
  [Husayn] I certainly hope that this will be the case in the 
future and that this will manifest itself because it is needed. 
And I believe we will see many changes... 
  [Sesno, interrupting] You sound skeptical? 
  [Husayn] I can't comment on others, Sir, and I won't in this 
instance, but I really hope that he will live up to the 
expectations of the Palestinian people and he has our full 
support and full backing. 
  [Sesno] Finally, Your Majesty, a personal question. You 
came to the United States to go to the Mayo Clinic to see how 
your cancer that you had treated two years ago was doing. How 
is your bill of health? 
  [Husayn] A good bill of health, sir, clean bill of health. 
No trace of cancer after two years, and therefore, no need for 
visits to Mayo beyond regular annual checkup, hopefully from now. 
  [Sesno] Very good news, indeed. 
  [Husayn] Thank you so much. 
  [Sesno] King Husayn, thank you very much for joining me. I 
appreciate it very much. 
  [Husayn] Thank you.
