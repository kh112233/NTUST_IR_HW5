FT  23 APR 92 / Mexican explosions kill at least 129
AT LEAST 129 people were killed yesterday when a series of gas explosions
tore through the Mexican city of Guadalajara, agencies report from Mexico
City. The Mexican Red Cross said up to 600 people had been injured.
Hospitals were filled after a series of at least nine blasts rocked the
eastern part of the city, Mexico's second-largest with a population of about
3m.
Residents of the affected area had complained the day before of gases
escaping from sewer ducts.
A statement by Pemex, Mexico's state oil monopoly, said the gases came from
a privately owned cooking oil factory and leaked into the sewage system. It
blamed the explosion on hexane gas, which is used in extracting edible oils
from seeds.
However, the city's fire chief said the explosions were caused by petrol.
The blasts damaged offices and residences, many heavily, within a 12-block
radius.  Officials estimate as many as 1,000 buildings have been affected.
About 700 police and rescue workers frantically dug through the wreckage of
collapsed buildings.
The federal government declared a national emergency and began moving field
hospitals, rescue workers, medical helicopters and other equipment into the
city, 350 miles north-west of Mexico City. The governor of Guadalajara
ordered the state university to be opened to provide emergency housing for
victims.
Doctors and health workers said sewage was leaking from some of the blasted
sewer lines, posing a health threat.
The city, famed for its Spanish colonial architecture, has a large community
of American retirees as well as foreign medical students.
