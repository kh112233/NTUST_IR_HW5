<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The purpose of this final rule is to codify the national marketing quotas and price support levels for the 1994 crops
for several kinds of tobacco announced by press release on March 1, 1994. 


In accordance with the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 (the 1938 Act), as amended, the Secretary determined the
1994 marketing quotas to be as follows: Fire-cured (type 21), 2.150 million pounds; fire-cured (types 2223),
40.4 million pounds; dark air-cured (types 3536), 10.6 million pounds; Virginia sun-cured (type 37), 131,000
pounds; cigar-filler and binder (types 4244 and 5355), 9.3 million pounds; and cigar-filler (type
46), zero pounds. 
This rule is necessary to adjust the production levels of these kinds of tobacco to more fully reflect supply and demand
conditions. 
In accordance with the Agricultural Act of 1949 (the 1949 Act), as amended, the Secretary determined the 1994 levels
of support to be as follows (in cents per pound): Fire-cured (type 21), 140.7; fire-cured (types 2223), 148.3;
dark air-cured (types 3536), 127.3; Virginia sun-cured (type 37), 124.5; cigar-filler and binder (types
4244 and 5355), 108.4; and cigar-filler (type 46), 84.4.
