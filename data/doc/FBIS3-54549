  [Excerpt] "I welcome King Husayn's proposal," Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin stated last night in response to the 
Jordanian monarch's remarks to Israeli journalists about his 
willingness to meet openly with the Israeli premier. 
  Upon returning from Strasbourg last night, Rabin said he 
would welcome any meeting with an Arab leader without any 
preconditions, of course. These remarks are yet another phase 
in the warming of relations between Israel and Jordan. [passage
