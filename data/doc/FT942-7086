FT  27 MAY 94 / Gabon is first to reschedule debts
Gabon has become the first member of the African franc zone to reschedule
its commercial debt with all its external creditors, Peter John reports. The
final piece of its FFr17bn (Pounds 2bn) restructuring programme was put in
place yesterday when Mr Marcel Doupamby Matoka, finance minister, signed an
agreement in Paris with the London club of commercial bank creditors.
The deal, repayable over 10 years, represents some Dollars 170m (Pounds
113m) of debt. Gabon has already signed agreements with the Paris Club of
sovereign creditors and the International Monetary Fund. Mr Thierry
Desjardins of BNP, the French bank, said the move would boost the country's
credit rating. It should ease Gabon's ability to borrow while adjusting to
the 50 per cent devaluation of the African franc against the French franc.
