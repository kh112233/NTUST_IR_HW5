FT  01 APR 92 / Ukraine to be pressed on nuclear weapons
NATO ministers will today press Ukraine and other former Soviet republics
not to use their stocks of nuclear weapons for political leverage.
Concern about Ukraine's stance is expected to figure prominently at Nato
defence ministers' talks in Brussels.
Mr Pavel Grachov, Russia's deputy defence minister, said yesterday he had
told the US that the transfer of tactical nuclear weapons to Russia from
other republics would be completed by July 1, despite apparent Ukrainian
opposition.
Mr Grachov, who met Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, on the eve of the
talks, said hundreds of warheads now in Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan as
well as those in Russia would be stored carefully until destroyed.
The one-day meeting is the first of its kind bringing together defence
ministers from Nato and what used to be the Warsaw Pact, including 13 former
Soviet republics.
Mr Cheney said he would press for the fulfilment of pledges to place the
entire nuclear arsenal in Russia.
Tactical nuclear arms are due to be transferred to Russia by July 1 under an
agreement reached last December. Ukraine is also pledged to the removal of
strategic weapons by the end of 1994. Other strategic weapons are based in
Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus.
The talks are also expected to focus on the share-out of the military
equipment entitlements which were allocated to the Soviet Union under the
1990 Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.
