  [Text] Changsha, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Regulations on 
protection of minors, implemented as early as 1988, has produced 
positive results in central China's Hunan Province. 
  The province has carried out the law thoroughly, 
coordinating 
parents, schools and citizens, three main elements in educating 
and protecting people under the age of 18, to work for the 
healthy growth of minors. 
  More than 3,400 counselling centers have been opened, at 
which parents can realize their obligations and responsibilities 
for their children and be given information on juvenile 
psychology and physiology. 
  The province has extended a warm hand to its 91,000 school 
dropouts, mostly in poverty-stricken mountain areas. 
  Backed by more than six million yuan raised through various 
channels, over 30,000 dropouts have returned to school in three 
years. And eight "hope" primary schools have been set up. 
  Some 96.7 percent of children of school age have sat in 
classrooms. 
  The province has spared no efforts to enrich the cultural 
life of minors and crack down on pornography. 
  Its juvenile and children's library, whose name was 
personally calligraphed by Communist Party General Secretary and 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, has a collection of 500,000 
books, and last year had two million juvenile readers. 
  In 1993, more than 100 books by the two publishing houses 
which target adolescents gained awards at or above provincial 
level. 
  Moreover, orphans and disabled children have received 
medical 
care from the provincial civil affairs departments and hospitals. 
  In Xiangxi (western Hunan) Autonomous Prefecture, 1,100 
children who contracted cataracts and 377 young polio patients 
have been relieved of their suffering.
