P. M. BRIEFING; 
FDA ASKED TO ACT ON FOOD LABELING 
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said today he has asked 
the Food and Drug Administration to consider major changes in government food 
labeling standards. 
The FDA is expected to propose a federal rule on the various aspects of food 
labeling early next year. The agency has long required labeling listing 
ingredients, net weight and nutritional information on foods. 
Sullivan said there is no comprehensive, mandatory food labeling requirement 
for nutritional labeling for all foods, despite the government's efforts to 
improve food labeling. 
"Interest in food labeling has never been higher," Sullivan said in a 
statement. "Food labeling bills have been introduced in Congress. Consumers are 
watching what they eat more closely."
