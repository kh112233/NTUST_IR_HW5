Several Asian Countries - Responsible for Several Epidemics''] 
  [Excerpts] In Paris, the latest issue of the BULLETIN 
EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE DE LA DIRECTION GENERALE DE LA SANTE (No. 29 
1993) reports the emergence of a new cholera strain responsible 
for recent epidemics in various Asian countries. 
  Several epidemics of choleraic syndromes -- vomiting, 
diarrhea, more or less serious dehydration -- have appeared in 
India and Bangladesh since the end of 1992. At the time of the 
first of these epidemics, in Madras, specialists were able to 
isolate a germ in patients that did not correspond to any of 
those known to cause cholera. This strain differed from 
Vibrio cholerae 01, the microorganism that causes 
epidemic cholera, and from the other species of 
Vibrio that can cause similar gastrointestinal 
infections. 
  It was then found that this microorganism is capable of 
producing a choleraic toxin and that it is resistant to numerous 
medicines, with the exception of some antibiotics such as 
tetracycline. Around the beginning of this year, a new strain 
caused a severe cholera epidemic in south Bangladesh (10,000 
cases and 500 deaths). A new epidemic occurred from January to 
April, this time in Calcutta (13,000 cases and 400 deaths), 
striking adults in particular and leading to very severe 
dehydration and blood disorders in patients. 
  It is evident from these indications that a new toxic and 
virulent strain has emerged in the last few months from the 
endemic Asiatic focus of cholera. It has now been named 
Vibrio cholerae 0139 or ``Bengal.'' Unlike the other 
previously known colonies, it directly threatens the entire 
population. 
  Its progression is very rapid, spreading as it did from 
south 
India to east India in just a few weeks. ``This new 
Vibrio will very probably spread in Asia and to other 
parts, affecting first of all the most indigent. International 
monitoring of the spread of this new strain must therefore be 
intensified,'' the General Directorate of Health, in Paris, 
points out.
