  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 27, BNS -- The Estonian Government 
attaches this year great importance to speeding up the 
privatization of industrial enterprises, giving top priority to 
selling agricultural processing firms and timber, chemical and 
construction companies. 
  The Cabinet's privatization program for 1994 stipulates 
that, 
first of all, the enterprises on which offers have been made are 
to be put on the privatization list. 
  The government regards bidding, bidding combined with 
negotiations, and public sale of shares as the principal methods 
of privatization. The main criterion of choice is the need for 
additional conditions such as investments and job retention. 
  The Cabinet plans to use more widely public bidding. 
  The government considers it necessary to start this year 
privatization through public sale of shares. The state will 
retain an average of 25 percent of the capital stock, which is 
later to be sold for the privatization vouchers. 
  The sale of enterprises' shares for privatization vouchers 
is 
to begin not later than the second half of the year. The 
vouchers will be used also in selling property and controlling 
blocks of stock, when a part of the purchase price set by the 
Privatization Agency will have to be paid in money. 
  The government is of the opinion that no restrictions must 
be 
applied to the privatization process and it must be maximally 
open. The participation of local businessmen in the process is 
to be promoted by the application of favorable installment 
payment conditions, privatization vouchers, and Article 32 of 
the privatization law.
