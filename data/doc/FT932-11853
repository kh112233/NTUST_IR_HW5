FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: ICI Australia 29% ahead at
half-time on static turnover
ICI Australia, a subsidiary of the UK chemicals group, yesterday announced a
29 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 37.8m (USDollars 27.2m) after
abnormal items for the six months ended March, on turnover little changed at
ADollars 1.39bn.
The group said abnormal losses of ADollars 10.6m mainly comprised a
restatement of future income tax benefits in anticipation of a proposed
reduction in the rate of corporate taxation from 39 per cent to 33 per cent.
The board said the lack of sales growth reflected the lack of any worthwhile
recovery in the Australian economy. The profit improvement followed higher
productivity, lower costs, and the closure of lossmaking businesses.
The closures included an ephedrine plant in Newcastle, an advanced ceramics
factory at Rockingham in Western Australia and plants at Rhodes, NSW, all of
which had been making losses.
ICI said prices for its chlor-alkali and sodium cyanide products remained at
historically low levels because of world over-supply. Plastics prices also
remained low and dumping continued to be 'a significant problem'.
The directors said the full-year result would 'satisfactorily exceed' last
year unless trading conditions worsened, but 'significant improvement
depends mainly on recovery in the Australian economy and international
petrochemical prices'.
The directors declared an interim dividend of 7 cents a share, up 2 cents.
The board said the increase reflected the directors' intention to increase
the interim dividend as a proportion of the total dividend.
