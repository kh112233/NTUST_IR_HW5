 

Finally, an agency requested that OPM consider revisions that would result in the crediting of sick leave in retirement
computations for employees covered by FERS or allow some type of payback for sick leave. This comment is beyond the
scope of these regulations and would require a legislative change.



Other Changes



The final regulations at 630.401(a)(2) have been revised to permit the use of sick leave by an employee who is
incapacitated for the performance of his or her duties by physical or mental illness or to care for a family member incapacitated
as a result of physical or mental illness. The purpose of this change is to clarify the circumstances in which an employee
is entitled to use sick leave.



Waiver of Delay in Effective Date



In the spirit of the President's memorandum of July 11, 1994, directing agencies to establish and support family-friendly
work arrangements, and consistent with the recent changes in law on the purposes for which sick leave may be used, I
find good cause exists for making these rules effective in less than 30 days pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). The delay
in the effective date is being waived to give affected employees the benefit of these new provisions as of December
2, 1994.



E.O. 12866, Regulatory Review



This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because they will affect only Federal employees and agencies.
