FT  24 APR 92 / Nucor rules out Ravenscraig deal
HOPES evaporated yesterday that Nucor, the US steel producer, would salvage
part of British Steel's complex at Ravenscraig, Lanarkshire. Nucor officials
visiting Scotland told shop stewards that the plant was not suitable for its
needs.
Nucor did not rule out building a mini-mill in Britain to produce sheet
steel by the thin-slab casting process. Hunterston on the Firth of Clyde,
where British Steel has an ore handling terminal and two mothballed steel
plants using the direct reduction process, is a possible site.
Mr George Quinn, one of the shop stewards at Ravenscraig, which is due to
close in September with the loss of 1,200 jobs, said Nucor thought that the
cost of refurbishing the coke ovens and blast furnaces at Ravenscraig made
its plans unviable. He blamed British Steel for failing to invest
sufficiently in the plant in the past.
The Nucor team visited Scotland at the invitation of Scottish Enterprise,
the development body, after a suggestion by Mr Jeremy Bray, the Labour MP
for Motherwell South.
It had always been unlikely that Ravenscraig, as an integrated plant, would
be compatible with the type of operation in which Nucor specialises in the
US, or that British Steel would be eager to encourage a potential
competitor.
The Nucor executives are expected to meet Mr Ian Lang, Scottish Secretary,
or Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish industry minister, before leaving Britain.
