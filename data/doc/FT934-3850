FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: A prescription for future growth - Glaxo
sets great store on developing its own products
Last week, Dr Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive, spent most of his
Tuesday afternoon in the Sorcerer's Room of the elegant Thameside hotel, the
Savoy.
His object was to explain to the media, for the first time in nearly two
years, the progress of the pipeline of new products with which Glaxo will
conjure its future.
The company, Europe's largest drugs group and challenger for the world's top
position currently held by Merck of the US, also offered a round-up of the
commercial environment and the prospects for its drugs.
The presentation's emphasis on research and development was significant,
however. The group was not going to be seduced by diversification, said Dr
Sykes. He has rejected strategies adopted by other groups such as worldwide
rationalisation, mergers, and joint ventures and mergers for generic and
over-the-counter non-prescription businesses.
Instead, Glaxo has adopted a strategy of concentrating on patented
prescription medicines in spite of an increasingly difficult environment for
drugs.
The group's strategy was to focus rather than dissipate its energies, said
Dr Sykes. It planned to maximise sales of established drugs such as Zantac,
the anti-ulcer treatment; bring new and innovative drugs to market; bring
these products to market fast on a global basis; and invest in developing
markets.
The radical strategic departure adopted by Merck of vertical integration
through the Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) acquisition of Medco Containment, a
mail order company, was also dismissed by Dr Sykes. 'The concept is good,
it's doubtful whether it was worth what Merck paid for it. There are other
ways of achieving the same ends with less expense,' he claimed.
Meanwhile, Glaxo is adopting a flexible approach to change. Dr Sykes
stressed the importance of reacting to local conditions. This commitment to
local autonomy within a framework of central strategic direction was also
stressed in the group's annual report this year, and was in sharp contrast
to the managerial style of Dr Ernest Mario, Dr Sykes's predecessor, who was
sacked last March.
Dr Mario had an extremely detailed grasp of local conditions and is
understood to have meddled in the activities of certain subsidiaries.
Key to the group's ability to maximise revenues remains its ability to
increase revenues from Zantac, the best-selling medicine of all time with
sales last financial year of Pounds 2.2bn.
Dr Sykes was dismissive of the threat posed to the drug through the
eradication of a bacterium, helicobacter pylori, associated with ulcers.
Most patients were effectively treated with Zantac maintenance therapy said
Dr Sykes. A few patients taking the drug relapsed, and for these it was a
good idea to use a combination of drugs to eradicate HP, he agreed.
'But if you eradicate HP in everybody who comes into the surgery with
ulcers, it will work in anything between 10 per cent and 70 per cent of
patients. That's playing Russian roulette because half of those people are
going to relapse and 10 per cent will perforate, and of those 5 per cent
will die. You can't gamble like that,' he argued.
The main threat to Zantac remained generic competition. The US patents of
Tagamet, SmithKline Beecham's drug and one of Zantac's main competitors,
expire next year, but Dr Sykes did not expect it to have a big impact.
'There's no direct relationship between price and usage. Service, volume
discounts and what other drugs you offer are equally important,' said Dr
Sykes.
Meanwhile, Glaxo plans to drive growth through its new products, Imigran,
the migraine treatment, Zofran, an anti-nausea drug, and Serevent, an asthma
medicine.
Glaxo's increasing management flexibility has been demonstrated by its
decision to launch low-dose versions of Imigran, following criticisms of the
high price of the 100mg version. Dr Sykes said the move to launch 25mg and
50mg doses would help expand the market for those with mild migraines and,
although not particularly driven by criticisms of price, the decision would
help reduce them.
Meanwhile, analysts believe the development pipeline looks rich, with few
'me-too' products. There are more compounds in exploratory development - 16
 -than ever before.
Zofran, also known as ondansetron, was as effective as Warner-Lambert's
Cognex for the treatment of Alzheimer's symptoms and was far safer, said Dr
Sykes. He hoped it would be filed by early 1995.
Also highlighted by Dr Sykes was GR92132X, a treatment for non-insulin
dependent diabetics. Glaxo's HIV-treatment, 3TC, also known as lamivudine,
looks effective in hepatitis B, a huge killer in the developing world, he
said.
Ranitidine bismuth citrate could become important for HP eradication when
used with antibiotics. Remifentanil, an injectable anaesthetic, was a
sleeper, capable of becoming an important drug, he quipped.
Given the company's full pipeline, and its clear strategy based on patented
prescription medicines, Dr Sykes, Glaxo's sorcerer-in-chief, has staked the
group's future on its ability to create and market new drugs. Glaxo's
shareholders must now hope the sorcerer's strategy does not turn out to be
hocus-pocus.
