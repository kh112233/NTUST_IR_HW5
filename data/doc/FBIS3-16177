between Latvia and Estonia on cooperation in the air transport 
sphere was initialled; a cooperation protocol was also signed 
between the Estonian and Latvian civil aviation administrations. 
This is the first document of its kind on cooperation in the air 
transport sphere in the Baltic countries. The signing of the 
treaty may take place in the near future. It provides for 
establishing permanent flights, Riga-Tallinn and Tallinn-Riga,
