APPRAISER PLEADS GUILTY IN CONSOLIDATED SAVINGS FRAUD 
A real estate appraiser for defunct Consolidated Savings Bank of Irvine pleaded 
guilty Monday in federal court to charges of conspiring to mislead the 
institution and failing to file income tax returns. 
Harlan Wolfe, 61, of Glendale, pleaded guilty to conspiring to prepare a phony 
appraisal of a home for Consolidated so the thrift's books could disguise a 
crooked $500,000 real estate loan to unnamed straw borrowers. 
Straw borrowers, who act as middlemen in obtaining loans to hide the identity 
of true borrowers, helped facilitate many S&amp;L frauds, federal prosecutors 
said. 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Gregory D. Schetina said that, as part of the Consolidated 
conspiracy, Wolfe misrepresented the value of a Laguna Beach home as $850,000 
by saying that it was a custom-built oceanfront house, when he knew that it was 
several miles from the beach and worth only about $200,000. 
Wolfe allegedly funneled the extra money to Pyrotronics, an Anaheim-based 
fireworks company that was owned by Orange County businessman W. Patrick 
Moriarty. Moriarty served 29 months in prison after being convicted of charges 
related to political corruption. Consolidated's owner, Robert A. Ferrante, has 
been called a close business associate of Moriarty. 
Wolfe also pleaded guilty to four counts of failing to file income tax returns 
from 1983 through 1986, Schetina said. The appraiser had been charged with 
seven misdemeanor counts of failing to file.
