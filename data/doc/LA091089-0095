The Navy launched its newest Trident nuclear submarine, the $1.2-billion 
Pennsylvania, at New London, Conn., while about 100 anti-nuclear activists 
protested. Six of them were arrested and charged with criminal trespass and 
reckless operation of a motor vessel after they crossed Coast Guard barriers 
and tried to affix an anti-nuclear flag to the submarine. They were released 
after posting bond. Demonstrators organized by Greenpeace, an environmental and 
anti-nuclear group, fired mock missiles from a 40-foot boat made up to look 
like a submarine and dubbed the "Expennsylvania" in an attempt to ridicule the 
Navy's Trident program. The 560-foot-long Pennsylvania is the second ballistic 
missile submarine equipped to carry the Trident 2, which has a range of up to 
4,000 miles and an accuracy of within 200 yards.
