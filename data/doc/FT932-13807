FT  22 APR 93 / Pakistan 'implicated in blasts'
INDIA said yesterday that investigations into the series of bomb blasts that
rocked Bombay on March 12 clearly revealed Pakistan's organised support and
involvement in the 'planning and execution' of the terrorist attack.
In a statement to parliament yesterday, Mr S B Chavan, the Indian home
minister, stated that India had proof of Pakistan's involvement in the
blasts, which killed 250 people. The minister said Pakistan had given
shelter to members of the Memon family, prime suspects in the case,
despatched arms and explosives to the Indian coast, and trained people
involved in the blasts.
Mr Chavan said that the investigation by the Bombay police had revealed,
among other things, that there was a conspiracy hatched by Pakistan with Mr
Dawood Ibrahim, the Dubai-based don of the Indian underworld, and Mr Ibrahim
Abdul Razak Memon, a close aide of Mr Dawood, to destabilise India.
Meanwhile, Mr Ziauddin Bukhari, a prominent Moslem League politician and a
former member of the state legislature, was shot dead yesterday in south
Bombay by four unidentified gunmen.
Maoist rebels killed at least 17 people, including 10 policemen, in an
attack on a market town in Maharashtra state, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
reported yesterday, Reuter adds.
The rebels set off a landmine under a police vehicle on Tuesday and opened
fire on bystanders. The People's War Group, a Maoist organisation was
believed to be responsible.
