Medicare Program; Coverage of Epoetin (EPO) Used by Competent Home Dialysis Patients 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule adopts as final the interim final rule that provided for Medicare coverage of EPO used by ESRD beneficiaries
who dialyze at home and are competent to use the drug without medical or other supervision and established criteria
for selection of patients that can be considered ``competent'' and for monitoring of the patients who are selected.
It also makes minor changes in response to public comments on the interim rule. 


The interim rule was necessary to implement section 4201(d)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA
'90). The purpose of the amendments is to facilitate use of EPO at home, while ensuring that such use of the drug is safe.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE: 

These rules are effective on February 9, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


Chronic renal failure (CRF) is a progressive and usually irreversible decline in kidney function that does not always
require regular dialysis. However, CRF patients who have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) do require a regular course
of dialysis or kidney transplantation in order to sustain life. 
Section 299I of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 (Pub. L. 92603) established the Medicare ESRD benefit
by extending coverage to any individual who requires either dialysis or transplantation and meets the following
requirements:

 

&bull;Is fully or currently insured or entitled to monthly benefits under title II of the Social Security Act; or 
&bull;Is the spouse or dependent child of the insured or entitled individual.



The methods and amounts of payment for services to ESRD patients have changed over the years and are currently set forth
in 410.50, 410.52, and 413.170413.179 of the HCFA rules. Law and program policy have moved over
the years towards encouraging greater use of self-dialysis and home dialysis. 
On June 1, 1989, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the generic drug epoetin which we commonly refer to
as ``EPO''. EPO is a sterile, colorless, preservative-free, liquid, biologically engineered protein that stimulates
the bone marrow to make new red blood cells. EPO may be covered under the Medicare program when used to treat anemia associated
with chronic renal failure. Most chronic renal failure patients are anemic because their kidneys are unable to produce
sufficient amounts of a substance called erythropoietin. 
Patients with chronic renal failure include those who require renal dialysis and are eligible for Medicare under
the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) provisions of the law. In accordance with the labeling approved by the FDA, EPO
may be administered either intravenously or subcutaneously for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic
renal failure or anemia induced by the drug AZT used by patients with the HIV virus. Individuals with chronic renal
failure use the drug to elevate or maintain the red blood cell level (as measured by the hematocrit or hemoglobin level)
and to decrease the need for blood transfusions. Chronic renal patients considered for initiation of EPO therapy
should generally have a hematocrit of less than 30%. 
In July, 1989, we issued instructions in the Provider Reimbursement Manual_Part 1 (Chapter 27, Transmittal 11) authorizing
Medicare contractors to start paying for the drug EPO, as of June 1, 1989. Coverage instructions were issued in November
1989 in the Intermediary Manual_Part 3 (Transmittal 1449), Carriers Manual_Part 3 (Transmittal 1329), Hospital
Manual (Transmittal 576) and the Renal Dialysis Facility Manual (Transmittal 42). The effective date of the coverage
instructions was also June 1, 1989. The Medicare regulations were not amended at that time. 
Before enactment of Public Law 101508 (OBRA '90), home use of EPO was not covered. For patients who dialyzed
at home to receive Medicare payment for EPO, the drug had to be administered either in an ESRD facility or as a service
``incident to'' a physician's professional services. 


II. Statutory Provisions 


Section 4201(d)(1) of OBRA '90 amended section 1861(s)(2) of the Act by adding a new subparagraph (Q) that_



&bull;Provides for coverage, effective July 1, 1991, of EPO that is used by home dialysis patients who are competent
to use the drug without medical or other supervision and for coverage of items related to administration of the drug;
and 
&bull;Requires the Secretary to establish by regulation methods and standards for the safe and effective use of the
drug at home.
