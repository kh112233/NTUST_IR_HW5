  [Text] Tunis, June 14 (AFP) -- A Rwandan rebel official 
said here Tuesday [14 June] his forces and the government had 
agreed to an immediate ceasefire. 
  The official, Pasteur Bizimundu, said the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front would order its fighters to hold their fire Tuesday 
evening. 
  He said Rwanda's interim government had made the same 
pledge. 
Officials from both sides were in Tunis on the sidelines of an 
Organization of African Unity summit. 
  The ceasefire was reached in a meeting with the presidents 
of 
Zaire, Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi. 
  Ceasefire talks collapsed earlier in the day in the capital 
city Kigali after Hutu militiamen abducted and probably killed 
between 30 and 40 people, many of them children, who had been 
sheltering in a church, the United Nations said. 
  The rebel army is dominated by the minority Tutsis.
