  [Text] Once again, the conflict in Liberia seems to be 
spilling across the border into neighboring Guinea. Some months 
ago there were clashes on the Guinea side of the border 
involving rival factions and ethnic groups fighting each other 
in Liberia. There has been a fresh attack and a lot of 
civilians have died. From Conakry, Foday Fofana telexed this 
report: 
  Intelligence sources here said that the Lofa Defense Force, 
LDF, which is fighting ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia] in Liberia's Upper Lofa County, has 
launched an attack on the Guinean border town of Koyama, near 
Zozo District. At least 30 civilians are thought to have died 
in the attack. According to reports reaching Conakry today from 
the town of Macenta, LDF rebels crossed into Guinea on Wednesday 
[1 June] night and used automatic weapons in their attack. 
Details of this assault are so far scanty and a team of 
investigators from the Interior Ministry is expected to travel 
to the area. 
  If this week's attack is proved to be the work of the LDF, 
the movement will lose a lot of sympathy in Guinea, despite the 
support it currently enjoys here from members of the Toma tribe. 
Guinea closed all land borders with Liberia last year following 
what was thought to be a ULIMO crossborder attack, which 
resulted in the death of many Guinean civilians. Last year's 
incursion sparked off vengeance attacks between the (Koniyakis) 
who side with ULIMO and the Tomas who join forces with the LDF.
