  [Text] Kushiro, Hokkaido, Jan. 24 KYODO -- The Hokkaido 
prefectural government initiated an investigation Monday [24 
January] into charges by the Russian Foreign Ministry that tens 
of Japanese fishing vessels violated Russian territorial waters 
Friday and Saturday. Russia alleges the Japanese fishing boats 
entered Russia's territorial waters near Kunashiri Island, one 
of four Russian-held islands claimed by Japan. 
  Prefectural government officials questioned the heads of 
eight fishery cooperatives, while the Maritime Safety Agency 
[MSA] requested a detailed explanation of what happened over the 
weekend. 
  MSA officials said the agency received a notification last 
Friday that Russia was strengthening its policies against border 
transgressions and added two to three patrol boats to the waters 
surrounding the disputed islands. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry also said that three Japanese 
patrol boats were in the vicinity at the time of the alleged 
transgressions but did nothing to halt the intrusions into 
Russian territory. The MSA on Monday denied the charge as 
"impossible." 
  ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported over the weekend that more 
than 50 Japanese vessels violated territorial waters Friday and 
some 30 others Saturday. 
  Japan has long called for the return of four 
Russian-occupied 
islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai group -- 
which the former Soviet Union seized at the end of World War II.
