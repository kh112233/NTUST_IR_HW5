The key poison in the herbicide Agent Orange, used extensively in the Vietnam 
War, may kill animals but appears relatively harmless to people, experts in 
long-term studies said at the National Environmental Health Conference, which 
was held in San Antonio. Researchers presented the latest findings on 
large-scale studies of the effects of dioxin, the toxic ingredient of Agent 
Orange. Except for skin cancer, no major differences from normal levels were 
found in the cancer and heart disease rates of 1,261 U.S. soldiers exposed to 
the poison, according to a $50-million Air Force study. Also, no unusual deaths 
or illnesses were found in 40,000 people tracked in a University of Milan study 
following a 1979 Italian dioxin plant explosion that contaminated a nearby 
town.
