THE WORLD 
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has asked four nations to accept 
U.S. anti-terrorism agents who would gather intelligence and check airport 
security, U.S. News and World Report said. Bush Administration officials were 
unavailable for comment. This week's edition of the magazine named the 
countries as Britain, Italy, West Germany and Israel and said that if 
permission were granted, agents of the Federal Aviation Administration could be 
in place by year's end. The publication also said that Skinner earlier told 
aviation officials abroad that the White House would soon ask Congress to make 
it a crime for any airline flying in and out of the United States to leak 
information from the U.S. government about terrorist threats.
