  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Good morning. The main police 
headquarters reports that part of the Basque Fatherland and 
Liberty's [ETA] infrastructure in Navarre has been dismantled. 
After investigations carried out by police belonging to the 
Pamplona headquarters, an apartment which was suspected of being 
ETA's operational base in Navarre was entered and searched. The 
police seized three kilos of explosives of the ammonal type, 
various devices, detonators made by ETA, car licence plates, as 
well as files belonging to the terrorist gang. 
  According to this information the ETA members might be from 
the Txomin Iturbe commando group. The apartment is located at
