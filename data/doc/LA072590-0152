P.M. BRIEFING; 
ISRAEL HALTS STOCKHOLM FLIGHTS 
Israel's Transport Ministry today ordered the suspension of flights by 
state-owned El Al airlines to Stockholm, saying new airport security measures 
there were inadequate. 
Ministry officials said Israel told the Swedish Foreign Ministry of the 
decision, saying the new arrangements "did not satisfy Israel's stringent 
demands." They said the twice-weekly flights will resume once the matter is 
resolved. 
Both ministry and El Al officials declined to comment on the changes made at 
Stockholm's Arlanda airport. 
The national carrier has in the past suspended flights to Vienna, Frankfurt and 
Budapest citing security concerns.
