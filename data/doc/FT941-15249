FT  15 JAN 94 / Property: New lines of communication for commuters -
Transport priorities are increasingly influencing our choice of home
Commuting is an American invention that is a century old and inseparable
from season tickets. The word referred first to people who bought
'commutation tickets' at a discount for a bulk buy, in true US fashion. It
had nothing to do with what we mean by commuting today - regular travel to
and from one's place of work in a city. But if commuting has changed its
meaning as a word, it is still about trains and season tickets, and dreams
of a place of one's own outside the city.
The railways transformed the south of England. Sussex, Surrey, Kent and
Hampshire became dormitories for London and a gardener's paradise where the
newly-discovered rhododendrons and azaleas flourished. Haywards Heath and
Burgess Hill, in mid-Sussex, would not exist but for the trains.
North of the Thames, the Metropolitan Railway (now the London Underground's
Metropolitan line) reached into Middlesex.
And, in this century, the Underground network spread above ground into
Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.
Londoners have become resigned to broken signals, ageing trains and failed
power supplies. Those difficulties, along with security alerts, mean that
you never know how long to allow for a journey on the Underground. Sometimes
it is quicker than you ever imagine but a decaying infrastructure and
inadequate investment bedevil the system. It is hard to know how committed a
'back-to-basics' government is to improving London's most basic need, public
transportation of a standard that should match any in the world.
While London Underground continues renewing escalators and rewiring, and
decides whether or not it will finish refurbishing Mornington Crescent on
the Northern line (please do), major improvements on the horizon will ease
congestion on existing lines and give more choice.
With luck, by the end of the century, the fast Channel Tunnel rail link to
Waterloo and Kings Cross or St Pancras will make Paris and Brussels less
than three hours away and Ashford in Kent 40 minutes instead of 70.
Paddington will be the terminus for an express shuttle to Heathrow (16
minutes) and for the east-west Crossrail line to Liverpool Street (via Bond
Street, Tottenham Court Road and Farringdon). Work has begun on extending
the Jubilee line to Westminster, Waterloo, London Bridge, Canary Wharf and
on to Stratford. Other expected improvements are: higher capacity on
Thameslink, British Rail's north-south through route linking Brighton,
Gatwick and points to Bedford; extensions to the Docklands Light Railway;
and perhaps the Chelsea-Hackney line (which would run from Wimbledon to
Leytonstone).
Few commuters, whether British Rail or Underground, can make a completely
detached decision on where to live, considering only the ease and cost of
getting to work. For most, the other variables are quite as important: how
near are they to grandparents, schools, rugby at Twickenham or opera at
Glyndebourne?
The Kent BR lines are notoriously slow. A friend moving from Canterbury to
Salisbury found it takes no more time to reach her place of work in central
London - even though Salisbury is much further away. But, when all the
decisions have been made about the Channel tunnel rail link, and the fast
trains are running, life might be different. If you like Kent, hang in
there.
In East and West Sussex, houses within three miles of Haywards Heath station
command a 10 per cent premium, says Stephen Hardwick, of Cluttons. That is
because there are frequent trains to both London Bridge for the City and
Victoria for the West End. If you miss one, there is always another. And as
the line suffers fewer delays than others in the area - autumn leaves are a
hazard on the Uckfield line - it is easy to make power breakfasts in London
or an 8am start in a City office.
That is harder to achieve if you commute in from Lewes, in East Sussex.
Lewes has fewer trains which take longer. Some Lewes folk drive to Gatwick,
leave their cars in the airport car park and then take the train.
If you want to live in Brighton, even though the non-stop Pullman train the
Brighton Belle no longer exists, there is a bonus. The season ticket costs
the same as from Haywards Heath.
Surrey is leading the climb back in the property market, just as it led the
recent decline. Haslemere is reputed to sell more first class season tickets
(annual cost Pounds 3,288) than any other station in the country. South
London will benefit from extending the Docklands Light Railway to Lewisham,
giving a direct link to Bank station, in the heart of the city.
For people living west of London the Paddington rail schemes may provide
major change. For example It will be far easier to reach the City via
Crossrail. For Buckinghamshire commuters the so-called Turbo trains, on the
Chiltern line to Marylebone, are fast and regular, but short on leg room.
The Underground's Metropolitan line is the alternative.
North of the capital Milton Keynes has three trains an hour to Euston, and
for a long-distance commuter Peterborough to Kings Cross is an hour. If you
plan to work in the in the City and live in the country, consider homes in
East Anglia. East Anglian trains arrive at Liverpool Street, from where it
is but a short walk to Bank station.
But is it healthy to spend so much time travelling? Is parking the wife and
children in suburbs or country a relic of the antediluvian days when women
did not work?
Before you decide to be a commuter think how much better a property you
could buy in London by putting the season ticket money into mortgage
payments.
A transmission error meant that the number of the National Energy Foundation
in Milton Keynes was given incorrectly last week. The correct number is:
0908-672787.
