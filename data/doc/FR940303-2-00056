of a patent which claims that human drug product.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Imagent

&reg;

 GI. Imagent

&reg;

 GI (perflubron) is indicated for oral use with magnetic resonance imaging to enhance delineation of the bowel in order
to distinguish it from adjacent organs and areas of suspected pathology. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent
and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Imagent

&reg;

 GI (U.S. Patent No. 3,975,512) from the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois, and the Patent and Trademark
Office requested FDA's assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. FDA, in
a letter dated September 23, 1993, advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone
a regulatory review period and that the approval of Imagent

&reg;

 GI represented the first commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Imagent

&reg;

 GI is 7,493 days. Of this time, 6,469 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while
1,024 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: February 8, 1973. The applicant claims February 9, 1973, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND)
became effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was February 8, 1973, which was 30 days
after FDA's receipt of the IND. 2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: October 25, 1990. The applicant claims June 18, 1990, as the date the new drug application (NDA) for Imagent

&reg;

 GI (NDA 20091) was initially submitted. FDA refused to file this application and notified the applicant of
this fact by a letter dated August 16, 1990. The completed NDA 20091 was resubmitted on October 25, 1990, the
initially submitted date.
3. 

The date the application was approved

: August 13, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20091 was approved on August 13, 1993.
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 730 days of patent term
extension.
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before May 2, 1994, submit to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before August 30, 1994, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 4142, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30. 
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.
