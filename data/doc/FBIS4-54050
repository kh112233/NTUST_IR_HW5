  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- The Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI) said Wednesday [25 May] it will impose 
administrative punishment on two individual exporters for 
illegal parts shipments to China. 
  Katsuhisa Iida, owner of Traders, a trading company based in 
Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, and its president Norimitsu Sugiyama, 
exported a total of four image-enhancing tubes to China in July 
and October of 1993 without obtaining export permits, MITI said. 
The action constituted a violation of the Foreign Exchange and 
Foreign Trade Control Law, MITI said. The two traders will be 
prohibited from all export activity for one month from June 1, 
MITI said. 
  Image-enhancing tubes are used as components of viewing 
equipment for enhancing visibility in darkness, which could be 
converted for military purposes. Traders, a company which had 
specialized in business with China, folded in January this year.
