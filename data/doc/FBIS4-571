  [Text] The Federal Government has expressed satisfaction 
with the present security arrangements at Murtala Muhammed 
International Airport, Lagos. The minister of transport and 
aviation, Chief Ebenezer Babatope, stated this in Lagos today 
when an official of the United States Federal Aviation 
Administration, Mr. Walker Park, paid him a courtesy visit. 
  Chief Babatope explained that a lot had been done to raise 
the level of security at the airport and expressed the hope that 
the United States would soon lift the embargo imposed on the 
airport. He said the Federal Government appreciated the 
cooperation and understanding of the American Embassy. Chief 
Babatope and the minister of state for transport and aviation, 
Alhaji Aremu Yahaya, had earlier met with the American official 
behind closed doors. The team is in the country to inspect 
facilities at the airport. 
  The American Government severed air links with Nigeria in 
August last year because of what it called inadequate security 
arrangements at the airport. Meanwhile, the minister of 
transport and aviation and its counterpart in the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs will on Monday [18 April] next week carry out a 
joint inspection of the airport.
