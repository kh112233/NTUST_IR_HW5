  [Text] Pretoria March 15 SAPA -- A moratorium has been 
placed on the export and international marketing of landmines, 
Minister of Defence Kobie Coetsee announced in Pretoria on 
Tuesday [15 March]. He said the decision, effective 
immediately, followed a United Nations General Assembly session 
in October last year which expressed its concern about the 
indiscriminate way in which landmines caused the maiming and 
death of innocent civilians in several countries. 
  "South Africa is in the forefront in the world in the field 
of anti-mine measures and mine-tracking abilities, but the 
availability of our anti-mine equipment is hampered by 
international armaments sanctions. The effective use of mine 
resistance armoured vehicles such as the South African-developed 
Mamba can protect and save peace-keeping forces from being 
maimed. Several countries such as Bosnia, Mozambique and Angola 
could benefit from our assistance and equipment," Mr Coetsee 
said.
