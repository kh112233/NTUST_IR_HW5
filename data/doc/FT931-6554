FT  01 MAR 93 / Arts: Today's Television
New ideas about the state of the universe are discussed in Horizon (8.00
BBC2) which looks at the 100-inch telescope built 70 years ago by Edwin
Hubble in California, and also at the Hubble space telescope. Although the
only thing most of us know about the space telescope is that it has a defect
in its mirror, it has still been surveying distant parts of the universe and
showing that more galaxies existed when our solar system was young. ITV's
new drama, September Song, is about Billy and Ted (Michael Williams and
comedian Russ Abbot) who suddenly change their lives when, in their late
fifties, Billy loses his job as a barman and Ted loses his wife. They decamp
to Blackpool when Billy is offered a job as a compere in what turns out to
be a strip joint. Tonight's episode (8.00) lasts an hour. History will
surely conclude that, among all the social experiments tried in the later
part of the 20th century, closing the mental hospitals and pushing the
patients out to sink or swim was the most iniquitous. Panorama looks at a
mother who killed her children a month after leaving a mental hospital (9.30
BBC1).
