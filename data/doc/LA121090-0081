GULF WATCH: DAY 130; 
A DAILY BRIEFING PAPER ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS; 
HOSTAGE FRONT: 
A U.S.-chartered Iraqi airliner carrying about 175 Americans touched down early 
today in Frankfurt, Germany, after a flight from Baghdad, the day after a 
smaller group of freed hostages touched down in Texas. Another jet carrying 
about 160 Italians and a sprinkling of hostages of other nationalities arrived 
in Rome, and a British-chartered jet is scheduled to leave today. 
Diplomatic Front: 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to 
meet with him by Jan. 3, noting that the Iraqi suggestion of Jan. 12 is only 
three days before the U.N. deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. 
Baker, anticipating a peaceful end to the crisis, said that U.S.-led 
multinational forces would remain in the region during possible negotiations 
later between Baghdad and a restored Kuwaiti government. 
Baker also said the United States is working to avoid an international 
conference on the Palestinian issue now because that would imply a linkage with 
the gulf crisis. 
Meanwhile, Jordan's King Hussein proposed a peace plan that calls for 
compromise, for talks among Arabs and for linking other regional problems, such 
as the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
Military Front: 
An American soldier became the 53rd serviceman to die during Operation Desert 
Shield when the tractor-trailer truck he was driving overturned during a 
routine water supply mission. 
In London, the Observer newspaper said Iraq appears to be redrawing the 
Iraqi-Kuwaiti border by putting up a barbed-wire fence around the northern part 
of Kuwait, a sign that Saddam Hussein may be planning a partial withdrawal.
