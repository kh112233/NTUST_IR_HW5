FT  16 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Timor Gap seismic work past
mid-stage
OIL COMPANIES working in the Timor Gap have completed more than half their
seismic programme agreed earlier this year and the first exploration well is
scheduled for December.
Officials of the Australia-Indonesia Joint Authority for the Timor Gap Zone
of Co-operation say over 26,000 km (16,000 miles) of seismic work has been
completed since 11 contract areas were designated between December 1991 and
last February.
The contracts commited companies to six-year exploration programmes worth
Dollars 362m, under which they must complete 52,100 km of seismic work and
drill 45 exploration wells.
The Timor Gap is an offshore area of about 60,000 sq km between Indonesia
and Australia. A dispute between the two countries over rights to the area
was resolved by a treaty of co-operation, which came into effect in February
1991.
The first well is to be drilled by the Australian subsidiary of Marathon
Oil, a US-based company. A Marathon official said on Tuesday that a tender
for a drilling vessel would be placed soon and a further four wells were
scheduled for next year.
Marathon is leading a consortium of Santos and Korea Petroleum in two
contract areas and is commited to a Dollars 76m programme to drill 12 wells
and conduct 10,000 km of seismic work. Other companies holding a stake in
the contract areas include Shell, BP, Phillips and Enterprise Oil.
The acreage agreements provide for production to be shared equally between
the Joint Authority and the contractor, after recovery costs, up to the
first 50,000 barrels. The governments of Indonesia and Australia are equal
partners in the joint authority.
Industry officials say the Timor Gap is a largely unknown territory for oil
exploration. Only one well has previously been drilled in the area, 14 years
ago, which found some gas and indicated the presence of hydrocarbons but not
in commercial quantities.
