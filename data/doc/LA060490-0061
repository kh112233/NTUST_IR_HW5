HIGHWAY CLOSED FOR 12 HOURS AFTER VAN TOPPLES POWER POLE 
A toppled electrical pole caused officials to close California 118 -- one of 
Ventura County's main east-west roads -- for 12 hours Sunday, forcing motorists 
to detour nearly nine miles. 
A van ran off the road and knocked down the pole at 5:49 a.m., blocking the 
road about a mile west of Moorpark, said Officer David Wighton of the 
California Highway Patrol. 
Motorists were detoured onto Grimes Canyon Road, Broadway, Stockton Road and 
Balcom Canyon Road until 5:49 p.m., when California 118 reopened. 
"We've had traffic going by here all day long," said Fauvette Rollyson, who 
lives on Stockton. "Fortunately, this was not a weekday or the trucks would be 
unbelievable." 
Wighton agreed. "On a weekday you get a heavy commuter traffic, but today was 
pretty light," he said. 
Another Stockton Road resident, Richard Allen, said he counted almost 100 cars 
a minute going in both directions during peak traffic on the detour. "It was 
steady, almost bumper-to-bumper," Allen said, adding that Stockton Road 
normally is seldom used. 
"Usually, on a weekend, if someone goes by I go out to see who it is," Allen 
said. 
Keith Sheldon, a spokesman for Southern California Edison Co., said the toppled 
wires were "live" and had to be handled carefully. Then a new pole had to be 
installed and wires restrung before the road could be reopened. 
The accident cut power to residents in the immediate area, Sheldon said. 
Rollyson said her home lost power for about 75 minutes, but Allen had no power 
loss. 
The accident occurred when Salvador Padilla, 28, of Pomona, driving a Chevrolet 
van west on 118, veered across the opposing lane, left the roadway and hit the 
pole, Wighton said. 
Padilla left the scene but was found in Moorpark about 5 1/2 hours later by 
deputies of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, Lt. Kelly McIlvain said. 
He has not been cited, Wighton said.
