  [Text] Department `Tiger'--this will be the name of a 
new unit in the Maritime Kray Environmental Protection 
Committee, formed by order of the Russian Federation. 
  The department will have special groups for combating 
poaching, which, together with internal affairs and procuracy 
organs, will track all violations involving rare and endangered 
species of animals and plants. Together with customs and border 
control, they will also have the task of intercepting all 
attempts to smuggle rare animals out of the country. 
  This measure was necessitated by growing poaching in the Far 
East, the object of which, unfortunately, are rare and 
endangered animals and plants: Amur tiger, white-chested bear, 
East-Siberian leopard, as well as rare birds and reptiles. They 
are smuggled abroad--to China and Korea. For instance, according 
to estimates of ministry for protection of environment and 
natural resources specialists, over the past two years about 150 
tigers have been killed in the Far East forests--and that 
keeping in mind that at the end of 1980's the total population 
of this species was about 350. 
  International organizations also are joining in the fight to 
save the Amur tiger.
