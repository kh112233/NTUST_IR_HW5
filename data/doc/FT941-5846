FT  04 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Non-stick coating with wide
spread
A non-stick coating that can be used on anything from saucepans to cars has
been developed in the US by the Dow Chemical Company.
The water-based chemical can be cured at a much lower temperature (100`C)
than existing coatings, and so has much wider applications.
The coating, which incorporates perfluoroakyl polymers, could even be used
on heat-sensitive materials such as plastics or wallpapers. It dissolves in
water like a soap and so can be painted on to the surface. Then it is baked
to produce the toughened coating.
The 3M Corporation has bought the licence for the new process. Dow Chemical
