<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food and Drug Administration, HHS.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the antibiotic drug regulations to provide for the inclusion of
accepted standards for a new bulk form of cefmetazole and for its use in a new dosage form of cefmetazole sodium, cefmetazole
sodium injection. The manufacturer has supplied sufficient data and information to establish its safety and efficacy.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Effective April 18, 1994; written comments, notice of participation, and requests for a hearing by April 18, 1994;
data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing by May 16, 1994.


</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 123,
12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of (1) a new bulk form of cefmetazole,
and (2) for its use in a new dosage form of cefmetazole sodium, cefmetazole sodium injection. The agency has concluded
that the data supplied by the manufacturer concerning this antibiotic drug are adequate to establish its safety and
efficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR part 442 to provide
for the inclusion of accepted standards for this product.


Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


Submitting Comments and Filing Objections


This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because, when effective, it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
April 18, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before April 18, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before April 18, 1994,
a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before May 16, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

cefmetazole sodium equivalent to 20 milligrams or 40 milligrams of cefmetazole per milliliter. Its cefmetazole
content is satisfactory if it is not less than 90 percent and not more than 120 percent of the number of milligrams of
cefmetazole that it is represented to contain. It is sterile. It contains not more than 0.2 endotoxin units per milligram.
Its pH is not less than 4.2 and not more than 6.2. It passes the identity test. The cefmetazole used conforms to the standards
prescribed by 442.69(a)(1).
(2) 

Labeling

. It shall be labeled in accordance with the requirements of 432.5 of this chapter.
(3) 

Requests for certification; samples

. In addition to complying with the requirements of 431.1 of this chapter, each such request shall contain:

(

2

) For sterility testing: 20 immediate containers, collected at regular intervals throughout each filling operation.
(b) 

Tests and methods of assay

. Thaw the sample as directed in the labeling. The sample solution used for testing must be at room temperature.
(1) 

Cefmetazole potency

. Proceed as directed in 442.70a(b)(1), except prepare the sample solution and calculate the cefmetazole
content as follows:
(i) 

Preparation of sample solution

. Using a suitable hypodermic needle and syringe, remove an accurately measured portion from each container immediately
after thawing and reaching room temperature and dilute with mobile phase to obtain a solution containing 500 micrograms
of cefmetazole per milliliter (estimated). Prepare the sample solution just prior to its introduction into the chromatograph.
(ii) 

Calculation

. Calculate the milligrams of cefmetazole per milliliter of sample as follows:
