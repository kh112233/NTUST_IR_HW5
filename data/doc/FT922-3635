FT  10 JUN 92 / Procedural moves delay sentencing of Guerin
THE sentencing in the US on fraud charges of Mr James Guerin, the convicted
former deputy chairman of Britain's Ferranti group and the man at the centre
of a Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 600m) arms contract scandal, was last night
postponed until today, write Alan Friedman in New York and Tom Flannery in
Philadelphia.
The postponement followed hours of procedural debate between prosecutors and
Mr Guerin's lawyer.
During more than two hours of pre-sentencing hearings in a Philadelphia
court, Mr Guerin admitted he had lied on several occasions to his former
associates at International Signal &amp; Control (ISC), the Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, company that he founded and in 1987 sold to Ferranti of the
UK.
Mr Guerin said some of the lies included misleading fellow executives about
alleged US government approval for the covert shipment in 1980 of US
military technologies.
He faces a possible prison sentence of between 30 years and life.
