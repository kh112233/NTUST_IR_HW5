FT  24 APR 93 / Tuberculosis 'a global emergency'
THE World Health Organisation yesterday declared tuberculosis a 'global
emergency'. Unless immediate action is taken to curb its spread, the
resurgent TB bacillus will kill 30m to 40m people over the next decade.
'Tuberculosis is humanity's greatest killer and it is out of control in many
parts of the world,' said Dr Arati Kochi, manager of the WHO TB programme.
'The disease - preventable and treatable - has been grossly neglected and no
country is immune to it.'
The declaration came at the end of a WHO meeting in London, at which
emergency measures to combat the disease were discussed.
WHO aims to spend Dollars 20m over the next two years, helping developing
countries to establish effective national TB programmes. After that, it
says, Dollars 80m a year must be provided by aid agencies and development
banks to buy medicines and diagnostic equipment and maintain a modest
infrastructure.
Developing countries account for 95 per cent of TB cases and 97 per cent of
deaths. But TB, the forgotten terror of the 19th century, is beginning to
return even in Europe and North America; the number of cases in the
industrialised world has increased by about 20 per cent since its all-time
low in the mid 1980s.
The WHO says the reasons for the disease's resurgence include neglect by
health authorities and researchers, increasing travel and migration,
emergence of drug resistance and - most importantly - the deadly synergy
between TB bacteria and HIV, the virus that causes Aids.
HIV activates tuberculosis in people whose infection was previously inactive
and, conversely, TB accelerates the development of Aids in those who are
HIV-positive.
