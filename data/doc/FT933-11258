FT  30 JUL 93 / Technology: A secure move for personal computers - Worth
Watching
Most computer security devices prevent unauthorised access, copying of discs
or the spread of viruses. Swift-Tech, of Huntingdon, has produced a device
which does all three.
The Sysecure, which is compatible with almost all PCs, is a mechanical lock
which attaches to the floppy disc drive and controls the power supply to
them. By tapping a pin number into the keypad the PC can be used. Two
security levels mean some users can access data from the floppy disc, while
others can only use data held on the computer's memory, preventing
virus-ridden discs being introduced and software being illegally copied.
