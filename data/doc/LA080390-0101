REP. FLAKE ACCUSED OF BILKING CHURCH PROJECT 
U.S. Rep. Floyd H. Flake was indicted Thursday for conspiracy, fraud and tax 
evasion in the alleged embezzlement of funds from a federally subsidized senior 
citizens housing project run by his church. 
The indictment, announced by U.S. Atty. 
Andrew Maloney, listed 17 counts against the New York Democrat and nine against 
his wife, described as the bookkeeper for the operation. 
In addition to his congressional duties, Flake is the pastor of the 
156-year-old Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Queens. The church 
built and operates the 300-unit senior-citizen facility. 
Maloney said at a news conference that Flake stole about $75,000 in 
transportation funds from the Allen Senior Citizens Apartments from 1983 to 
1987, and diverted another $66,000 in church funds to his own use from 1983 to 
1988. 
The allegedly misappropriated money was not reported by Flake on federal income 
tax returns, Maloney said. 
The church built the facility with a $10-million grant from the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. HUD also provides $100,000 a month in subsidies 
for operations, Maloney said. 
Flake, in a statement, said he had cooperated fully with the government in an 
18-month investigation. He said he and his wife, Margarett, are innocent. 
"Our abiding belief in God and in the American system of justice reassures us 
that, despite the awful price, justice will triumph and we will be vindicated 
at trial," Flake said. 
If convicted on all 17 counts, Flake could be sentenced to 87 years in prison 
and fined up to $3.95 million. His wife could face penalties of 55 years in 
prison.
