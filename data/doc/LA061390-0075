SPY SUSPECT HELD WITHOUT BAIL 
A former Army sergeant accused of breaching U.S. and NATO security by 
videotaping military secrets for delivery to Eastern European countries was 
ordered held without bond Tuesday, pending trial on espionage charges. 
Roderick James Ramsay, 28, who was an assistant documents custodian for the 8th 
Infantry Division in West Germany, said nothing during the five-minute 
detention hearing. 
"Based on the information and testimony presented last Friday, there is 
probable cause to hold the defendant . . . . I order that he be detained until 
his trial," U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth Jenkins said. 
During a hearing Friday, FBI Agent Joe Navarro testified that Ramsay had 
acknowledged videotaping sensitive documents in 1985 for Clyde Lee Conrad, a 
retired sergeant who was convicted of treason last week in a West German court. 
Ramsay's trial has not yet been scheduled. If convicted, he could be sentenced 
to life in prison.
