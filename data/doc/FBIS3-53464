  [Text] During the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] 
contact group session in Geneva today, our country's [Iran] 
Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati proposed that members of 
the contact group should visit Sarajevo in order to demonstrate 
the determination of the Islamic states to offer full support to 
the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Referring to the shortcomings of the international community 
in the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, he demanded a decisive 
response against the Serb aggressors and said: In view of the 
United Nations' failure to create safe havens, we once again ask 
the UN Security Council to dispatch troops from the Islamic 
countries to Bosnia as peacekeeping forces. 
  Velayati reiterated our country's desire to dispatch 5,000 
to 
10,000 troops to Bosnia and asked the UN Security Council to 
give the Bosnian Muslims the chance to defend themselves so as 
to prevent further genocide and ethnic cleansing. 
  According to a report of the Central News Unit, the Bosnian 
prime minister welcomed the clear and decisive stances of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran.
