SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The inventions available for licensing are:





NIST Docket No. 91001
Title:

 Improved Oscillating Tube Densimeter


Description:

 The oscillating tube densimeter provides a unique measurement of fluid density. The invention consists of an electrically
conducting tube, through which the fluid is passed, surrounded by a magnet. A current passed through the tube thus
generates electromagnetic forces. These forces, in turn, generate a resonant frequency in the tube which can be accurately
determined through a measurement of the induced voltage. Since the resonant frequency is dependent on the density
of the fluid, it can thus be correlated to this induced voltage.


NIST Docket No. 92008
Title:

 Sensing of Gas Metal Arc Welding Process Characteristics for Welding Process Control


Description:

 A method of monitoring and controlling the gas metal arc welding process. The weld electrical signals contain information
on the welding process characteristics. This invention monitors the welding process using a personal computer and
develops control responses from the information contained in these signals.


NIST Docket No. 92036
Title:

 Oxygen-Containing Organic Compounds As Boundary Lubricants for Silicon Nitride Ceramics


Description:

 Several oxygen-containing compounds have been identified as having boundary lubricating capability with silicon
nitride ceramics. Effective lubrication can be obtained over a range of molecular weight and concentration, with
some compounds suitable at concentrations of as little as 1% in a paraffinic oil.


NIST Docket No. 92038
Title:

 Optical Technique for Monitoring Electrochemical Interfaces


Description:

 This invention allows real time measurement of the progress of a chemical reaction at an electrochemical interface.
This is done by utilizing a coherent light source, without removing the solid interface from the sample and without
stopping the chemical reaction. The light sources used in the invention, which can include a helium neon laser or a
solid state laser, monitor the progress of a reaction by detecting changes in reactionary surface roughness and polarizability.
A wide range of chemical reactions may be measured, including, for example, metal finishing, electrochemical machining,
corrosion protection, metal deposition, electrochemical production, waste water treatment, or electrowining.


NIST Docket No. 92050
Title:

 Compton Scattering Tomography


Description:

 New NIST technology generates tomographic images of solid objects that can only be examined from a single side. Based
on Compton scattering of gamma rays of X-rays, the NIST-generated images reveal different densities within a material.


NIST Docket No. 92051
Title:

 Methods and Electrolytic Compositions for Electrodepositing Chromium Coatings


Description:

 A new NIST process deposits chromium plating up to 600 microns thick, without using or generating carcinogenic byproducts.
The plating process uses non-toxic trivalent chromium and the plating is three to four times harder, after heating,
than depositions using hexavalent chromium.


NIST Docket No. 92052
Title:

 Contactless Magnetically Coupled Linewidth System


Description:

 Linewidth measurements are made on integrated circuit test structures via magnetic coupling, removing the need
for electrical contacts. A potential source of contamination is eliminated which reduces the possibility of circuit
damage during testing.
