 

Powerhouse 

#

1 contains two generating units, one rated at 500 kW and one rated at 199 kW. Powerhouse 

#

2 contains a 275-kW generating unit. This is different from the authorized project features which consist of three
powerhouses containing a total of six generating units and a total generating capacity of 975 kW. Powerhouse 

#

1 was constructed in the same location of one of the authorized powerhouses. Powerhouse 

#

2 was constructed near Cedar Creek, approximately 4,500 feet away from the site of the nearest authorized powerhouse.

Status of Environmental Analysis: 

This application is now ready for environmental analysis at this time_see attached paragraph D9. 

l. 

The existing project consists of: 

(1) A 18.5-foot-high, 217-foot-long concrete and wooden dam 150 feet upstream from the Snoqualmie Falls, with 4.5-foot-high
flashboards and lift gates, creating an impoundment with a storage capacity of 390-acre-feet; (2) an intake structure
on the south bank of the river about 150 feet upstream from the dam feeding; (3) two 7.5-foot-diameter steel penstocks,
in 270-foot-long vertical rock shafts leading to; (4) Plant 1 which is an underground powerhouse containing 5 generating
units with a total capacity of 11,900 kW; (5) a 317-foot-long, 115-kV transmission line; (6) an intake structure on
the north bank about 50 feet upstream from the dam feeding; (7) a 12-foot-diameter, 1,215-foot-long concrete lined
tunnel leading to; (8) a small forebay and then to an 8-foot-diameter, 600-foot-long steel penstock for unit 1 and
two 7-foot-diameter, 75-foot-long steel penstock which will combine into a 10-foot-diameter, 515-foot-long steel
penstock for unit 2 leading to; (9) Plant 2 which is an above ground powerhouse with 2 generating units with a total capacity
of 30,090 kW; (10) a 0.5-mile-long, 115-kV transmission line; and (11) other appurtenances. The project has an average
annual generation of 256,000 MWH.

The applicant proposes to: (1) Refurbish the dam and add spillway capacity; (2) refurbish the intake structure for
Plant 1; (3) replace the existing penstocks to Plant 1 for an 8-foot-diameter steel penstock; (4) replace the 5 existing
units in Plant 1 with a new 9-MW unit; (5) abandon the existing and construct a new intake for Plant 2; (6) replace the
existing tunnel and penstocks to Plant 2 with a 20-foot-diameter, 250-foot-long vertical shaft and a 1,575-foot-long,
18-foot-high by 18-foot-wide horseshoe concrete-lined tunnel; and (7) upgrade the 2 existing units in Plant 2 and
extend the powerhouse to install a new unit for a total capacity of 64,000 kW. 

After upgrades and equipment additions, the project would have a total installed capacity of 73 MW with an average
annual generation of 381,000 MWH. 

m. 

Purpose of this Project: 

The energy generated by the project is used by the applicant in its system. The applicant is an investor-owned utility
company.
