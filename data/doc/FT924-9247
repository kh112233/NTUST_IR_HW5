FT  06 NOV 92 / Letter: Balance in education should be the priority
Sir, On examining your survey of post-16 education in England and Wales
('The FT-1000', October 31), I was struck by the following thought: why is
it that we place such enormous emphasis upon the academic performance of
schools and sixth-form colleges, and yet so little emphasis upon the extent
to which these institutions develop children emotionally?
I would suggest that one of the main aims of educators at all levels should
be to bring about the balance between reason and emotion which exists in a
healthy individual. However, our present approach to education seems to
place a fairly low priority upon this arduous yet extremely worthwhile task;
instead, the main focus of attention appears to be the training of the
intellect. In doing so, we not only risk creating unbalanced individuals,
but we may also be stifling the creativity which can flourish when children
are allowed to follow their desires through the free play of the
imagination. There are of course honourable exceptions to this trend, such
as the Waldorf Schools, the Small School set up by the Schumacher college,
etc - but these are few and far between.
It seems that the importance of placing greater priority upon emotional
development as a goal of education cannot be over-emphasised, as the dangers
of a one-sided intellectual approach can be seen in the legitimising of such
practices as man's domination over woman, and humanity's domination of the
environment. In order to re-establish the needed balance in these crucial
areas, we should recognise that the balance must be struck within each one
of us; and there can therefore be no better place to start than in the
education of future generations.
