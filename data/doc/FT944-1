FT  31 DEC 94 / Banks pressed on part-timer pensions
Banks and building societies could face bills for millions of pounds after
Bifu, the banking and finance union, lodged more than 2,500 industrial
tribunal claims to boost part-time workers' pensions.
The claims follow recent European Court rulings that excluding part-time
workers from company schemes could amount to sexual discrimination, as a
disproportionate number of part-timers are women.
Claimants will have to persuade British courts that their employer was
guilty of sexual bias in its decision to bar part-time workers from pension
provision.
The union said that many banks and building societies have only just
admitted all such workers to their pension schemes. But the European Court
rulings imply that workers could claim pension rights back to 1976. If they
succeed, financial institutions would have to put millions of pounds into
pension funds.
Mr Ed Sweeney, Bifu deputy general secretary, said: 'There has been massive
discrimination against part-timers. Employers tried to use them as cheap
labour and now they must pay the price.'
Staff from all the high street banks and many building societies are making
claims, but more than 1,300 claims cover staff and former staff of TSB
Group, which did not admit staff who worked fewer than 18 hours a week to
its pension scheme until 1991. TSB said last night that it was looking at
the directive's implications and meanwhile urged possible claimants to
register with it.
