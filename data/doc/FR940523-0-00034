 

In regard to the use of the 

kan

r

 gene, Calgene and the agency presented, and the committee discussed, such issues as the potential allergenicity
of APH(3
&rsquo;)II and the potential for ingested APH(3
&rsquo;)II to inactivate orally administered antibiotics. Most of the discussion concerning the 

kan

r

 gene focused on the potential transfer of the gene to microorganisms in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or in the environment.
In evaluating Calgene's food additive petition for the use of the 

kan

r

 gene product, APH(3
&rsquo;)II, in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton, FDA has considered the committee's
discussions and recommendations on this subject, which are summarized in section III.B.3. of this document. 


B. Scope of the Regulation 


Having completed its evaluation and having considered the deliberations of the Food Advisory Committee, the agency
is amending the food additive regulations to permit the use of APH(3
&rsquo;)II in the development of genetically modified tomatoes, oilseed rape, and cotton intended for food use.
Only the translation product of the 

kan

r

 gene, APH(3
&rsquo;)II, and not the gene itself, is being regulated as a food additive. As the 1992 policy statement indicated,
FDA does not anticipate that transferred genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)) would itself be regulated
as a food additive (57 FR 22984 at 22990). DNA is present in the cells of all living organisms, including every plant
and animal used for food by humans or animals, and is efficiently digested (Ref. 2). In this respect, the DNA that makes
up the 

kan

r

 gene does not differ from any other DNA and does not itself pose a safety concern as a component of food. 
This final rule is being promulgated after consideration of the issues relating to the safety of the use of APH(3
&rsquo;)II in the selection of transgenic plants. In addition, as noted above, because of the property of the 

kan

r

 gene to confer antibiotic resistance, the agency has considered the possibility that the gene might be transferred
to other organisms (discussed in section III.B. of this document). 
Potential safety issues specific to particular food products that contain the 

kan

r

 gene are not addressed by the agency in this document because such issues are beyond the scope of this rulemaking. For
example, issues associated with other co-transferred DNA sequences, including other genes intended to impart specific
traits, and issues related to potential genetic instability are not addressed because such issues will vary with
specific products. 
Developers of new plant varieties are responsible for addressing potential safety issues associated with specific
food products resulting from the transfer of genetic materials and for ensuring the safety of the food products that
they market. The policy statement contains a ``Guidance to Industry'' section (57 FR 22984 at 22991) that outlines
an approach for the safety evaluation of foods derived from transgenic plants and suggests that the agency be consulted,
as needed, to resolve critical issues. 
As noted, issues related to genetic instability are not addressed because such issues are not unique to the 

kan

r

 gene but apply to any transferred genetic material irrespective of the transfer techniques used. Genetic instability
could arise as a result of insertion of multiple copies of a given construct, especially if insertion occurs at multiple
loci. Recombinations of the transferred DNA could cause deletions, duplications, or rearrangements within the
plant genome (Ref. 3). Hence, in the 1992 policy statement, the agency noted that the genetic stability of a new plant
variety is an important safety consideration and further stated that, ``Factors that favor stability include a minimum
number of copies of the introduced genetic material, and insertion at a single site.'' (57 FR 22984 at 23004). 
In developing new plant varieties, developers are therefore responsible for following good manufacturing and good
agricultural practices to ensure that they have developed a genetically stable transgenic plant. As a practical
matter, this would ordinarily include using such techniques as segregation and Southern blot analysis to ensure
that new plant varieties chosen for development have the new genetic material inserted into a single locus and that
the number of copies of inserted DNA at a given site is limited to the minimum sufficient to achieve the intended effect.
