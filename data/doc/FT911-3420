FT  25 APR 91 / Setback to insurance tax reduction policy
THE DRIVE in the US Congress to reduce taxes for the US old-age insurance
system yesterday suffered a jolting setback on a 60-38 vote in the Senate to
shelve the proposal.
Senator Daniel Moynihan, the New York Democrat who is the leading proponent
of the Social Security tax reduction, said the movement for lower social
security taxes had gained ground because the other side had admitted that
the tax funds were being used inappropriately.
However, support for the measure has apparently diminished since last year,
when 54 senators voted in its favour. Senator Moynihan will try again later
in the session but he will have to get the votes of 60 senators instead of a
simple majority.
The vote was a victory for President George Bush, who along with Republican
and most Democratic leaders, contended that a reduction in social security
taxes would jeopardise the entire system.
A majority of the Democrats supported Senator Moynihan, agreeing with his
contention that regressive social security tax is being used to mask the
size of the federal budget deficit.
They propose to make the system more progressive by increasing total
payments by wealthier citizens.
