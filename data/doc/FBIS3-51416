independent of any political trend. He reported that 
investments will total 10.789 billion new pesos, 9.2-percent 
higher than 1993. Half will be used in drilling and exploration

average production level will remain at 2.7 million barrels per 
day. Approximately 50 percent will be destined for domestic 
consumption and the rest for export. Pemex Refining Director
