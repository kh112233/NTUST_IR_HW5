NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY 
The Heye collection of American Indian artifacts goes back to 1896 when George 
Heye acquired a Navajo buckskin shirt while on an engineering job in Arizona. 
Today, the Heye collection is one of the world's best dealing with the 
aboriginal peoples of North, Central and South America. It contains more than 1 
million artifacts, 40,000 books and 86,000 photo negatives and prints. For 
years, the collection has been deteriorating in a little-visited facility in 
the Upper West Side of Manhattan. 
Before long, however, the bulk of the collection will be housed in a new museum 
of the Smithsonian Institution devoted to the American Indian. Congress has 
passed legislation providing for construction of a $106-million building on the 
mall next to the Air and Space Museum and across from the National Gallery of 
Art. The legislation, expected to be signed by President Bush next week, also 
provides for a $25-million satellite museum in the federal Customs House in New 
York City to meet terms of the Heye Foundation trust that the collection remain 
in New York. 
That stipulation had snagged the transfer of the collection to the Smithsonian 
for years. But Julie Kidd, chairwoman of the Museum of the American Indian 
said, "It is a glorious solution." 
At last, American natives will be properly honored and represented within the 
nation's premier collection of museums. When the facility is operating, perhaps 
Smithsonian officials will consider frequent exhibitions in the West, where the 
Indian played such an important, and not fully appreciated, role in American 
culture and history.
