  [Text] Abidjan, 24 May (AFP) -- The Abidjan Court of 
Appeals today confirmed the three-year prison terms given on 21 
April to Abou Drahamane Sangare and Souleymane Senn, editing 
manager and reporter, respectively, for the daily LA VOIE, a 
paper with ties to the social democratic opposition. Mr. 
Sangare is the assistant secretary general of the main 
opposition party, the Ivorian Popular Front. The two men, 
jailed since 13 April, were found guilty of "inciting to 
violence" and "disturbing the public peace." On 5 April, LA 
VOIE published an editorial comment by Souleymann Senn entitled: 
"The Balance of Terror," which called on the opposition "to 
render the country ungovernable in order to make the ruling 
party realize that it is contending with a force which is, at 
least, equal to it in strength." 
  The assistant public prosecutor declared today that the 
sentence should "serve as a lesson, and deter all those who 
intend to embark on a similar path." 
  Messrs. Sangare and Senn, along with three other LA VOIE 
correspondents, had already been given one-year jail terms on 24 
March for "offensive language against the head of state," Mr. 
Henri Konan Bedie. However, at that time, the court did not 
issue a bench warrant against them, and they were not 
incarcerated. 
  At its congress held last week, the Cote d'Ivoire Union of 
Journalists deplored the harshness of the Press Act, and urged 
President Bedie to show mercy on the sentenced persons.
