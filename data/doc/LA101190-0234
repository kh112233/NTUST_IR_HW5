STATE; 
STANFORD GIVES 'PARTNERS' RIGHTS 
A new policy at Stanford University gives homosexual and unmarried couples the 
same rights as legally married students, entitling "domestic partners" to 
housing and university services such as library and athletic facilities. 
Norm Robinson, the school's acting dean of student affairs, said the policy, 
announced Tuesday by the university Board of Trustees, will keep students from 
having to choose between Stanford and their love interest. 
"The change also affirms Stanford's policy of not discriminating against 
students on a variety of factors, including sexual orientation," Robinson said.
