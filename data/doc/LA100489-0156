P.M. BRIEFING; 
IRISH MISSILE FIRM SOLD TO CANADIANS 
The British government today signed over the state-owned aircraft and guided 
missile maker Short Brothers to the Canadian group Bombardier. 
Bombardier, which makes subway rolling stock and small passenger jets, paid $48 
million for Shorts. The government gave the Montreal firm $1.25 billion in aid 
for the privatization takeover. 
"There are exciting times ahead for the aerospace industry, and I feel sure 
that under Bombardier's stewardship, Shorts will prosper," Britain's Northern 
Ireland Minister Peter Brooke told Bombardier Chairman Laurent Beaudoin. 
Bombardier defeated a joint bid by Dutch aircraft maker Fokker and Britain's 
General Electric Co. PLC for control of the company. West Germany's 
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm had earlier shown interest in acquiring Shorts, 
which once made biplanes under license for Orville and Wilbur Wright.
