THE NATION 
Winter continued to pound much of the nation as an estimated 30,000 homes in 
the Carolinas and Virginia were without power for a second day after 14 inches 
of snow and ice fell in the region. Freezing drizzle fell during the night 
across much of central and western Kansas, southwest Nebraska and southeast 
Colorado. Roads were hazardous. About 75 families of the southeastern Missouri 
community of East Prairie remained displaced after flooding from 11 inches of 
rain last week. Up to five inches of snow fell across Yellowstone National Park 
and light snow extended from the central Rockies westward. In Cleburne, Tex., 
workers drained 20,000 gallons of a toxic chemical from a tank car that tumbled 
into a creek in a rain-caused train derailment.
