IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
SEARCH NARROWS FOR GENE CAUSING MUSCLE ATROPHY 
Scientists reported last week that they have tracked down a genetic defect 
underlying an inherited muscle disease that strikes thousands of children 
worldwide. After a three-year search, a research team from Boston and New York 
said it has located the approximate site of the gene responsible for chronic 
spinal muscular atrophy. 
The finding paves the way for therapies for the now untreatable disease, which 
causes progressive weakness and wasting of muscles. 
The disorder and similar childhood spinal muscular atrophies are the leading 
cause of infant death from an inherited defect, and rank second only to cystic 
fibrosis as the most common type of inherited disorder. 
The chronic form of the disease, which usually appears between the ages of 6 
months and 17, has symptoms ranging from mild muscle weakness to inability to 
walk to premature death. It affects about 1 in 24,000 children worldwide. 
A more severe type of the disorder, which is about as common as the chronic 
form, is usually fatal before age 2. 
In a study published in the journal Nature, researchers from Tufts University 
medical school in Boston, New England Medical Center and Columbia University in 
New York said the genetic defect that causes chronic spinal muscular atrophy is 
apparently located on the "long arm" of Chromosome 5.
