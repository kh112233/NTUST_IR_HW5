PANEL OBJECTS TO PROPOSED STUDY OF BREAST CANCER DRUG; 
HEALTH: THE PROJECT WOULD HAVE INVOLVED 20,000 U.S. AND SOVIET WOMEN. BACKERS 
PLAN TO REDESIGN IT AND SEEK APPROVAL AGAIN. 
A federal advisory panel recommended Friday that the Food and Drug 
Administration reject a proposal to undertake a ground-breaking U.S.-Soviet 
study of 20,000 women to determine whether a hormonal drug can prevent breast 
cancer. 
The FDA's Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee agreed that a long-term study 
should be conducted to determine the effect of the hormonal drug tamoxifen in 
preventing breast cancer and other cancers in healthy women. 
But the panel said that its members had concluded that the design of the 
proposed 10-year, $100-million study of women in the United States and the 
Soviet Union was flawed. The committee said that it would recommend ways to 
correct the deficiencies. 
"I'm disappointed for the women of the country," said Phillip D. Bretz, 
director of the Desert Breast Institute in Rancho Mirage and one of the 
proposed study leaders. "I felt it was time to do it. None of these answers are 
going to be resolved until this study is done." 
Although the recommendation of an FDA advisory committee is not binding, it 
typically wields considerable weight in agency decision-making. The FDA must 
approve the U.S. segment of the study before it can begin. 
The committee said there was insufficient information on how the study would be 
conducted, including recruitment of patients and handling of data. Some members 
also expressed concern that the volunteers would not be at high enough risk for 
breast cancer. 
Bretz, however, said that the study was rejected because he did not have the 
academic ties of traditional researchers. He said that he would revise his 
study proposal in an effort to satisfy the committee's demands. 
The proposed study, endorsed by American and Soviet cancer specialists in 
March, would involve administration of tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen drug already 
widely used in post-surgical breast cancer therapy, to women considered at high 
risk for breast cancer. 
It would be the first large-scale study undertaken jointly in the United States 
and Soviet Union, its sponsors said. The pool of participants, about 10,000 
from each country, would consist primarily of daughters, sisters or mothers of 
women who have had breast cancer and who are considered at high risk of 
developing the disease themselves. Half of the women would be given a medically 
worthless placebo for comparison purposes. 
The researchers had predicted a 25% reduction in the incidence of breast cancer 
among the women who were given the drug. 
The study would be coordinated by Bretz; Dr. Philip B. Dreisbach, of the 
Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, and Dr. David Zaridze, deputy 
director of the All-Union Cancer Research Institute in Moscow. 
The study was opposed by some women's health advocacy groups, who said it is 
dangerous to experiment with drugs on healthy women. 
"This is a drug that is not risk-free," said Cindy Pearson, program director of 
the National Women's Health Network. "It's a fine drug for a breast cancer 
patient -- a woman facing the possibility of death is more than willing to take 
a drug that has some risk. But to jump from a drug that's effective in a group 
with a life-threatening disease to a huge trial in healthy women is crazy." 
But Dr. Wendy Schain, a psychologist with Memorial Cancer Institute in Long 
Beach and a former breast cancer patient, recommended approval of the study. 
"This is the best we've got," she said. "We need to get these answers. We have 
no better way to get them." 
Tamoxifen causes cancer in animals and has been linked to stroke, heart disease 
and endometrial cancer in women, according to the FDA. Sponsors of the proposed 
study, however, maintain that tamoxifen has minimal negative side effects and 
often reduces cholesterol and eases cardiovascular problems. 
FDA officials said that a large study of a drug in healthy humans was "a little 
unusual," but not unprecedented. "Any time you do a study on a drug for 
prophylaxis (prevention), you're going to use healthy people," said Dr. Robert 
Temple, the FDA's director of new drug evaluation. 
Tamoxifen, manufactured by the British firm Imperial Chemical Industries and 
sold under the brand name Nolvadex, has been used for more than a decade to 
prevent the recurrence of tumors in women whose cancer had spread to the 
underarm lymph nodes. 
Recently, the FDA approved its use in the post-surgical treatment of early 
breast cancer in women who do not have node involvement. In this country, it is 
produced and marketed by ICI Pharmaceuticals of Wilmington, Del. 
Tamoxifen works by blocking so-called estrogen receptors -- areas on the 
surface of cells to which the hormone binds to exert its effects. In that way, 
it blocks the effects of estrogen, which is believed to play a role in the 
stimulation of tumor growth in breast cancer. 
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the United States 
and the second leading cause of cancer death among women, after lung cancer. An 
estimated 150,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year.
