  [Text] With the aim of supplying more electric power to 
production establishments and people's households in the 
southern provinces, the prime minister recently approved a 
project to build the Ham Thuan-Dani Hydroelectric Power Plant. 
The plant will be build in areas of Tanh Linh and Ham Thuan Bac 
Districts in Binh Thuan Province and Bao Loc District in Lam 
Dong Province. Total capital for the project is more than 70 
billion Japanese yen; 85 percent will come from Japanese 
Government ODA [overseas development aid] and 15 percent from 
loans sought by the Ministry of Energy. Construction will 
commence in early 1996.
