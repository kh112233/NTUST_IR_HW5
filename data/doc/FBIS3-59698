<H5>  1. Foreword </H5>
  The city gas industry is keenly interested in fuel cells as 
urban-type on-site cogeneration power source and has been 
promoting their research and development for long time from the 
standpoint of protecting the global environment and economizing 
resources. 
  Since 1972, Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. and Osaka Gas Co., Ltd. have 
taken part in the Target Project, a U.S.-sponsored development 
project of on-site fuel cells for general consumers, and carried 
out the test of four PC11 units (each 12.5kW) the following 
year; inaugurating the development of fuel cells in our country. 
The gas industry later took part in consistent R&amp;D of on-site 
fuel cells in a series of projects including GRI of the United 
States, the Moonlight Project of AIST-NEDO and industrialization 
projects with domestic makers. This article is a report on the 
development and field tests of on-site phosphoric acid fuel 
cells (PAFC), which are steadily nearing completion. 
<H5>  2. Development of PAFC </H5>
  Table 1 shows the general outline of the development of 
on-site phosphoric acid fuel cells. 



<H3>  2-1. 50-kW and 100-kW Class Models (Joint Development by 
Three Gas Companies and Fuji Electric Co., Ltd.) </H3>
  The 50-kW model was made on trial as the first item in the 
merchandise development project by three gas companies. After 
the third improvement, the first trial model for mass production 
was perfected in early 1991. At present, 23 units are operating 
for evaluation tests in the facilities of four gas companies 
(Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas and Saibu Gas) and in those of 
customers. One model has already established the record for 
longest operating hours (13,000 hrs) with cumulative output of 
over 500,000kWh. Waste heat is exclusively used for producing 
hot water (60&deg;C). The first 100-kW model, developed after 
the 50-kW model, started operation in 1992. Six units have been 
installed in the facilities of Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas 
and others and the longest operating time of 4,000 hours has 
been established. Unlike the 50-kW type, half of the waste heat 
is recovered for the production of steam. A combination with the 
absorption refrigerating machine is awaited to lead to the 
realization of a more efficient cogeneration system. 
<H5>  2-2. 200-kW Models </H5>
<H3>  (1) Moonlight Project for Commercial Fuel Cells (NEDO, 
Osaka Gas, Kansai Electric Power and Mitsubishi Electric Corp.) </H3>
  The first model was installed at the Plaza Hotel, Kita-ku, 
Osaka, in July 1989 and started operation in August of the same 
year. The trial run was successfully concluded at the end of 
October 1991 with cumulative operating time of 13,038 hours (the 
longest record for domestic models). Cell deterioration was also 
kept within envisaged tolerance. 
<H5>  (2) The First Lot Units of PC25 (ONSI) </H5>
  Fifty units of this quasi-commercial model developed by ONSI 
of America are to be distributed around the world from 1992 to 
1994. Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas and Toho Gas are purchasing in 
succession 10 units, 10 units and one unit, respectively. Field 
tests have continued since 1992 in the facilities of customer 
companies. Nine units are operating at present with the longest 
operating time of over 6,000 hours. The heat output is 
exclusively used for the production of hot water for the 
present. It is optionally possible to produce hot water of 
90&deg;C for linking with an absorption refrigerating machine. 
<H5>  2-3. 500-kW Models (Osaka Gas and Fuji Electric) </H5>
  The development of 500-kW models was started in 1990, and a 
trial model has been installed and tested at Torishima Plant of 
Osaka Gas. Distinguishing features of the 500-kW model is that 
it is targeted at industrial uses and regional air conditioning, 
that the steam recovery ratio has been raised through low S/C, 
and that a fractional unit type package is adapted for the 
convenience of transport and installation. 
<H5>  2-4. 1,000-kW Models (NEDO and PAFC Association) </H5>
  Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas and Saibu Gas joined the 
Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell Technology Research Association (PAFC 
Association) established in April 1991 and are developing 
1,000-kW units with government subsidies. Toshiba Corp. is 
entrusted with the development. Demonstration tests are planned 
in 1995 and 1996 in the Tamachi area of Tokyo Gas. 
<H5>  3. Field Tests of PAFC </H5>
  The gas industry is stepping up the development and 
evaluation tests of on-site fuel cells in preparation for their 
early practical application. The Ministry of International Trade 
&amp; Industry inaugurated in FY 1992 subsidies for field tests 
of 
fuel cell power generation systems in parallel with solar 
photovoltaic power generation systems for expediting the 
introduction and diffusion of new power generation systems. This 
project is aimed at collection and analysis of various 
operational data under the actual conditions of fuel cells, 
thereby contributing to their diffusion. Field tests of fuel 
cells are to be conducted from FY 1992 to 1994 in more than 30 
categories by subsidizing one third of the costs involved. About 
&yen;600 million was appropriated for this purpose in the budget 
of FY 1992. 
  Gas companies took part in 15 sites of this project during 
FY 
1992. In addition, they are conducting their own field tests in 
the facilities of users. Among others, the field test at Umeda 
Center Building, Osaka, has achieved a continuous operating time 
of 4,786 hours and the world record is being renewed steadily. 
The field tests at present conducted by gas enterprises are 
listed in Table 2.

featuring higher generation efficiency, higher temperature of 
waste heat and the possibility of miniaturization through 
internal reform.

conducting demonstration tests of a 25-kW class power generation 
system manufactured by WH of the United States in the testing 
site of Rokko Island, Kobe, of Kansai Electric Power since 
February 1992. In addition, Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas introduced a 
WH's 25-kW class cogeneration system for evaluation tests in the 
Iwasaki Zone of Osaka Gas in October 1993.

  A feasibility study is being conducted on this cell type to 
ascertain the possibility of an on-site system.
