DR. NEIL SOLOMON: LISTING OILS IN FOODS 
Question: I sometimes see labels on food packages that list a number of 
different kinds of oil that may be present in the product, but it doesn't say 
which particular one is used. Are food manufacturers permitted to do this? 
Reading the label doesn't do much good if I still don't know what the food 
contains. 
Answer: Food and Drug Administration regulations permit manufacturers to list a 
number of oils that may be contained in a food when the oil is not the major 
ingredient. The manufacturer thus has the freedom to use a different oil at 
different times. However, for foods in which oil is the major ingredient, the 
manufacturer must list it by its common name, such as lard or coconut oil.
