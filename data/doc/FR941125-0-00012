<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY

: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the 

Federal Register

 of August 26, 1993 (58 FR 45204). The document amended the final monograph for over-the-counter (OTC) antacid drug
products to require that all antacid drug products contain the statement: ``Drug Interaction Precaution: Antacids
may interact with certain prescription drugs. If you are presently taking a prescription drug, do not take this product
without checking with your physician or other health professional.'' The document was published with an error in
the amendatory language. This document corrects that error.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

: FDA has discovered that the amendatory language in the final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 26, 1993 (58 FR 45204), was incorrect. The amendatory language, as published, revised the introductory
text of 331.30(d); it should have revised 331.30(d) to remove paragraph (d)(1). Accordingly, FDA is
removing paragraph (d)(1) to correct this error.
