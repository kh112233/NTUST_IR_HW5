YOUNG PEOPLE READ, BUT PAPERS AREN'T NO. 1 CHOICE 
Young people don't read much anymore because television has made them too 
passive to do anything as demanding as reading. Or is it that computers and 
video games have made them too active to do anything as undemanding as reading? 
So go two schools of conventional wisdom. 
As usual, the conventional wisdom is more conventional than wise. 
Yes, a young reader's attention span may be shorter now because of television; 
yes, today's young readers respond better to a more visually exciting 
presentation of information and entertainment, preferably one in which they can 
actively participate; yes, today's youth are accustomed to being able to pick 
and choose from among small, accessible bits of information rather than having 
to wade through long stories. 
But today's young people do read. It's just that they read magazines 
(particularly specialty magazines geared to their interests) and books 
(especially fiction) far more than they read newspapers. 
Library circulation of juvenile books increased 33% from 1980 to 1987, for 
example, compared to only 8% for adult books, according to a study by the 
Library Research Center at the University of Illinois. Sales of juvenile trade 
books rose 250% from 1972 to 1986. Such authors of adult fiction as Douglas 
Adams, Stephen King, Clive Barker and Danielle Steele all have large youth 
followings. 
The young read both escapist literature and, in magazines and newspapers, those 
stories and publications that have an impact on their daily lives and that 
speak to them in their language. Studies show that those aged 18-to-24 and 
25-to-34 are far more likely than people in older age groups to exercise, play 
sports, go skiing, camping or backpacking, go to a movie, a sporting event, a 
play or a concert. Not surprisingly, they want to read about those activities, 
too. The median age of readers of such magazines as Ski, World Tennis, Car and 
Driver, Rolling Stone, Seventeen, Mademoiselle and GQ is in the mid-to-late-20s 
-- 10 to 15 years younger than that for daily newspapers. 
In fact, according to one survey, people aged 18 to 34 account for 20% more 
than their proportionate share of total magazine readership, and they buy more 
than double their share of paperback books and 40% more than their share of 
hardcover books. 
There is also some indication that the more the young watch television, the 
more likely, not less likely, they are to read newspapers. The two media are 
often mutually reinforcing, not just competitive. When a strike closed all New 
York newspapers in 1978, for instance, the audience for television news shows 
in New York dropped noticeably; only when the newspapers resumed publishing did 
audiences return to pre-strike levels. 
Indeed, one can argue that today's younger readers -- "the best-educated 
generation in history and perhaps the most cosmopolitan, precocious and 
independent-minded," in the words of one study -- are an ideal audience for the 
daily newspaper. 
So why, apart from life style changes, is newspaper readership among the young 
-- children, teen-agers, people in their 20s -- at an all-time low? Is it just 
a matter of their having no interest in anything that doesn't affect them 
directly and of their only being attracted to the flashy and the superficial? 
"I wouldn't blackball a whole generation as a trivial group of people," said 
Jennie Buckner, a managing editor at the San Jose Mercury News. 
Buckner argues that editors shouldn't think that long stories automatically 
discourage young readers and that newspapers can attract the young only with 
short stories that don't tax their attention span or distract them too long 
from their strictly personal concerns. 
"If they're interested in the topic, they will read . . . long pieces on it," 
she said. "We have to package it better, make it easier to get through . . . 
show more discrimination . . . just better damn quality." Specifically, she 
said, young readers want more sophisticated consumer reporting and aggressive 
investigative reporting because they "don't trust official sources." 
Christine D. Urban, president of Urban &amp; Associates Inc., a market research 
and consulting company that specializes in newspapers, said surveys show that 
young people have essentially the same interests as older readers, except for 
local news. "They're just as interested in national and international (news) 
and . . . sports and . . . business, the same kinds of things that have 
traditionally been the foundation of a newspaper." 
'Barrier to Entry' 
The "barrier to entry" that newspapers pose for young readers seems to be much 
more format and style than content, Urban said. 
For one thing, she said, the young seem acutely sensitive to the pressures of 
time, and they find it "a lot more efficient" to do two things simultaneously 
-- driving a car and listening to all-news radio. A "single-dimensional 
activity" like sitting down to read a newspaper "seems like a phenomenal waste 
of time." 
But neither Urban nor any editors claim to have discovered how to overcome this 
problem and reach young readers. 
It's not for want of trying. 
Many papers without Sunday editions have been adding them -- theorizing that 
young people, in particular, will be attracted. A 1987 survey for the Newspaper 
Advertising Bureau showed that if readers were forced to choose between reading 
a Sunday paper or reading a paper the other six days a week, more than half the 
18-to-24-year-olds said they would rather have the Sunday paper. In every other 
age group, the daily paper was preferred, and that preference increased as age 
increased. 
What are papers that already have Sunday editions doing to attract the young? 
The Chicago Tribune publishes a weekly Style section aimed at young women and 
also provides special supplements for students, distributed with the paper in 
schools. The St. Louis Post Dispatch publishes a weekly, staff-written column 
based on discussions of teen-agers' problems by a "peer panel" of high school 
students, responding to letters from other high school students. The Boston 
Globe is publishing a continuing series on math and science instruction in the 
local schools and a weekly "Learning" page; the paper has also added a teen 
column, increased its coverage of pop culture and added a weekly, full-color, 
youth-oriented ArtsEtc. section. 
Even the New York Times, long a bastion of journalistic traditionalism, has 
added new life-style sections and columns on fitness, child-rearing and 
participatory sports, among other subjects of interest to younger readers. The 
New York Times also added pages on health and education and expanded its 
coverage of pop music and added a page on children's programming to its weekly 
television guide. 
'Is This for Me?' 
In an effort to provide what Executive Editor Max Frankel calls "multiple entry 
points on every page so that the scanner, the person in a hurry, can decide 
very quickly, 'Is this for me or is it not?' " the New York Times now labels 
many pages ("International," "National," "The Living Arts") and stories 
("Review/Dance," "Suburban Journal"). 
These changes are not designed exclusively for young readers, of course, but 
they do enable readers to save time and to easily find only what interests them 
-- two special concerns of the young. Moreover, Frankel said the paper is also 
planning to make its Sunday magazine more "hip . . . with it" and to publish 
more reports on campus life, street fashions and young designers as part of an 
overall effort to become more "reader friendly." 
"We've got to be important in people's lives," Frankel said. "They've got to 
need us, and once we get them hooked -- and preferably if we get them hooked 
early enough -- then it will be a lifelong habit that they have to at least 
look at us every day." 
Ironically, at a time when many newspapers are pushing the use of newspapers in 
the classroom as one of the best ways to begin the newspaper habit among the 
young, the New York Times has largely moved away from such programs at the 
elementary and secondary school level, according to Lance Primis, president of 
the paper. 
The New York Times pioneered the development of teaching tools for using 
newspapers in the classroom in 1932, and by the late 1960s sales through the 
paper's College and School Services accounted for 18% of total Times 
circulation. But in the 1980s, cost-cutting and advertisers' diminished 
interest in the young audience prompted the Times to greatly reduce those 
programs. The paper no longer provides teaching materials to schools (although 
it does sell papers to the schools and, two years ago, renewed its college 
sales program). 
Highly Regarded Program 
In contrast, the Los Angeles Times didn't start an official Newspaper in 
Education program until relatively late -- 1985 -- but it now has what is 
widely regarded as one of the eight or 10 best such programs in the country. 
Last year, The Times trained more than 1,000 teachers to use the newspaper as a 
classroom tool. 
Apart from this program, though, the Los Angeles Times has probably made fewer 
changes to try to attract younger readers than almost any other major newspaper 
in the United States. 
The Times has added color and shortened many stories, and it does provide a 
weekly review of books for young adults and extensive coverage of rock music, 
movies and television, and the paper's suburban sections do emphasize local 
news and sports -- all steps that surveys say can attract younger readers, even 
if that is not always their primary purpose. But The Times still publishes many 
long stories (like this one), and the paper has not done much specifically 
designed to attract young readers, the one demographic group whose wholesale 
defection in recent years has alarmed newspaper editors from coast to coast. 
"It's a matter of priorities," said William F. Thomas, editor of The Times from 
1971 until his retirement this year. "There's not enough room in the paper for 
all the things we want to present to people who need and want more broadly 
based information." 
Thomas said he has never seen "convincing proof" that attempts to woo younger 
readers "paid off in later newspaper readership." Nor, he said, did he "see any 
sense in tailoring any part of the paper . . . (in a way that) clashed with its 
basic personality." Even The Times' comics pages are aimed at adults, not 
children, Thomas said. "I didn't want the comics pages to be out of character 
either." 
But for many young people, comics have traditionally been the point of entry 
into a newspaper, and while television cartoon shows may have diminished their 
appeal somewhat, studies continue to show that comics are the favorite 
newspaper feature of most very young readers. 
At 42, Shelby Coffey III, who replaced Thomas as editor, is 22 years younger 
than Thomas -- but he agrees with his predecessor that a newspaper should 
remain true to its traditions and make no radical changes to accommodate 
specific audiences. Readers tend to become comfortable with their newspapers; 
radical change discomfits and alienates them. 
The Times has, however, been experimenting with a few possible approaches to 
youth in its Orange County edition -- a weekend entertainment guide, a weekly, 
full-page forum for (and largely by) high school students and a weekly news 
quiz. 
These experiments (and a few others) were launched in Orange County largely 
because of competitive pressure from the Orange County Register. 
The Register has aggressively sought younger readers. The paper publishes 
essays by young readers and offers a Family section every Thursday (including a 
serialized story for children aged 10 to 13). The Register also publishes some 
of the best color in any American newspaper, includes a special youth 
supplement, Young American, once a month and has a Friday entertainment section 
that is extremely popular with readers. 
The problem of youth readership affects newspapers of all sizes, and many other 
medium-sized -- and smaller -- papers are also trying a wide variety of tactics 
in an effort to address that problem. 
The Helena (Mont.) Independent Record (circulation 13,000) and Bismarck (N.D.) 
Tribune (circ. 29,000) have both started weekly tabloid sections for teen-age 
readers. The San Francisco Examiner (circ. 144,000) has hired three critics 
under 30 -- for rock music, television and the theater. The Sacramento Bee 
(circ. 250,000) uses special, youth-oriented radio advertisements on local rock 
music stations. 
James D. Squires, editor of the Chicago Tribune, thinks smaller papers have an 
advantage over large metropolitan dailies in the pursuit of young readers. 
"The young audience that we're trying to get is now much more likely to be 
grabbed by a local newspaper that deals with its community news," Squires said. 
"That lowest level of governmental jurisdiction, which taxes them and which 
causes them problems -- they want to know about it." 
Interest in Local News 
But studies show that most young people are not very interested in local news, 
the traditional franchise of all newspapers -- especially smaller papers -- and 
that gives smaller papers both a special challenge and a special opportunity. 
Not all editors think covering local government is the best way to meet that 
challenge. 
"I have diverted one hell of a lot of resources that used to be on government 
beats to areas like sports and entertainment to go where the audience is," said 
Michael Lloyd, editor of the Grand Rapids (Mich.) Press (circ. 138,000). "Going 
to the shopping mall is an entertainment. We deliberately run, once a week, a 
list of all the events happening at the shopping malls, whether it's a blood 
donor deal or a gingerbread-house (building) competition . . . home improvement 
fairs, craft fairs." 
Many small and medium-size papers also use Newspaper in Education programs as 
the keystone of their efforts to attract young readers, for now and for future 
generations. Programs at the Biloxi (Miss.) Sun Herald, Cedar Rapids (Iowa) 
Gazette, Jacksonville (Fla.) Journal and The State in Columbia, S.C., are 
generally regarded as among the best in the country (along with those at such 
larger papers as the Philadelphia Inquirer, USA Today, Los Angeles Times, 
Chicago Tribune, Detroit Free Press, Minneapolis Star Tribune and St. Louis 
Post Dispatch). 
It's no coincidence that four of these papers are owned by Knight Ridder, which 
is in the forefront of those trying to solve the problem of attracting young 
readers. 
"We're still just at the top of the first inning in even thinking about how to 
attack it," said James Batten, president and chief executive officer of Knight 
Ridder. "Cosmetic touches, which a lot of papers -- including some of ours -- 
have done don't really go at the heart of this question. This is a demographic 
group that's different in all kinds of ways from those that went before, and I 
think that we have to understand them better than we do and really be wide open 
to approaches that may be radically different from what we've done before. 
"Anybody who is not actively concerned about (young readers) . . . is living in 
a dream world." 
'Very High Priority' 
Knight Ridder is giving the problem of young readers "very high priority," 
Batten said. He has just appointed Lou Heldman, deputy managing editor of the 
Miami Herald, to take charge of a youth readership project full time, with help 
from one other full-time staffer and several others working half time, all 
looking for fresh approaches to attracting young readers. 
"No idea is too crazy to be off limits," Batten said. 
For those editors who worry that trying to attract young readers might 
undermine a paper's basic mission, it's worth noting that Knight Ridder 
newspapers have won more Pulitzer Prizes than any other papers in recent years 
-- 22 in the last four years alone. 
Like its sister Knight Ridder paper in San Jose, the Philadelphia Inquirer -- 
winner of seven Pulitzer Prizes in the last four years -- has already 
instituted new appeals to youth. For the very young, the Inquirer redesigned 
its Sunday funnies to include a strip on celebrities of interest to teen-agers 
and "The Mini Page," an assortment of stories, puzzles, illustrations and 
quizzes aimed at the 6-to-12-year-old audience and created by Betty Debnam, a 
former schoolteacher in Washington, D.C. ("The Mini Page" is syndicated to 
about 450 papers nationwide, including more than half a dozen in the Los 
Angeles area.) 
Every Friday in a special edition distributed to Philadelphia schools, the 
Inquirer prints a full page of activities, "For Students Today," referring them 
to specific stories in that day's paper to learn about math, science, social 
studies, language arts and other subjects. Philadelphia teachers can also call 
a toll-free number at the Inquirer to reach "Lesson Line," which provides 
guidance for using Inquirer stories as teaching tools. 
Lynne Berman, who is in charge of the paper's Newspaper in Education program, 
also supervises the production of monthly, 16-page, tabloid supplements on such 
issues as human rights, ethnic images, architecture and children's literature. 
The supplements are distributed to Philadelphia schoolchildren and sold to more 
than 100 other newspapers around the country for use in their schools. 
The Detroit Free Press, another Knight Ridder paper, also creates special 
monthly supplements for the schools on such subjects as elections, building 
self-esteem, the arts, black women and state history. But the paper's most 
innovative project is its high school journalism program, begun in 1985 and 
financed in part by local corporate sponsors. Journalism students come to the 
Free Press and, working with a Free Press editor, they write, edit and lay out 
their own school paper -- which is actually printed as a full page in special 
editions of the Free Press. Nineteen schools participate in the program. 
The students are mostly members of minority groups, so "by including high 
school newspapers in special Free Press editions, we have made our newspaper 
more relevant to this group and more likely to be used," the paper says. 
In cities like Detroit, with large minority populations, newspaper readership 
is a particularly acute problem; many members of minority groups are less well 
educated than most Anglos, and many immigrants do not speak English. 
Statistics suggest that the problem of attracting young newspaper readers could 
get worse, in part because of these conditions. According to a study by 
American Demographics magazine, minorities -- primarily blacks, Latinos and 
Asian-Americans -- will account for 87% of all U.S. population growth over the 
next decade; the median age of members of minority groups is considerably 
younger than that of non-minorities and birth rates in some minority groups are 
generally higher than for Anglos. 
But the problem of declining readership among the young ultimately cuts across 
all ethnic lines -- and most geographic lines as well. It may be somewhat less 
acute in the Northeast, where one survey showed 54% daily readership in the 
21-to-25 age group (compared with 45% in the West and Midwest and 36% in the 
Southeast), but editors everywhere are worried about the loss of young readers. 
"There are a lot of alternatives out there that are providing information that 
seems to fill some of their needs," said Gregory Favre, executive editor of the 
Sacramento Bee and chairman of the readership committee of the American Society 
of Newspaper Editors. "Perhaps we're not putting out a newspaper that younger 
people want to read." 
Tom Lutgen of The Times editorial library assisted with the research for this 
story. 
DIFFERENCES AMONG YOUNG READERS 
 Figures from National Assessment of Education Progress studies indicate that 
newspaper reading habits among readers aged 21-25 vary by region and education.
