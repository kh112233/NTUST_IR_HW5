FT  17 JAN 94 / People: Female judge on Japan's supreme court
Hisako Takahashi, a former director general of the labour ministry, has been
named as Japan's first female supreme court justice, writes Emiko Terazono.
Takahashi, 66, will become one of the country's 15 supreme court justices
when she succeeds Osamu Mimura, who retires next month. Prime minister
Morihiro Hosokawa is trying to follow President Clinton's initiative to
increase the number of women in key official posts.
Hosokawa had been concerned that although women are currently holding top
legislative and administrative posts, none was held in the judicial branch.
Takako Doi, former leader of the socialist party, has become the first
female speaker of the lower parliamentary house, and there are three female
cabinet ministers.
Takahashi entered the labour ministry in 1953 after graduating from the
University of Tokyo. She left last year after serving as cabinet counsellor
and director general.
The appointment will be formalised at a meeting of the cabinet on January 25
and will take effect on February 9.
