FT  05 JAN 93 / Argentina to allow dollar personal banking services
Argentina's central bank yesterday allowed banks to offer clients dollar
current accounts and cheque books, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
The measure was first announced after a short currency crisis in November,
when markets sold pesos heavily, fearing that an impending devaluation would
end almost two years of exchange rate stability.
In 1991, the government pegged the peso to the dollar, recognising the
dollar's use as virtual legal tender.
In another message aimed at calming currency markets, Mr Cavallo has
forecast a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 657.8m) seasonal capital outflow over coming
months, which might otherwise have been seen as a sign of the pesos's
weakness.
