  [Text] Larnaca (CNA)--A phone call saying that a bomb had 
been planted on a plane going to Vienna delayed the flight of 
Robert Lamb, U.S. State Department special representative on the 
Cyprus issue. 
  An unidentified man who spoke in Greek called the duty 
officer at Larnaca Airport and told him that "there is a bomb on 
the plane that will fly to Vienna." 
  The Austrian Airlines flight had just landed at the airport 
coming from Cairo. It was supposed to leave for Vienna at 1435 
[1235 GMT] today. 
  Police inspected the aircraft but found nothing suspicious. 
Following a careful inspection of the luggage and the 
passengers, which lasted for approximately one hour, the plane 
left at 1505 [1305 GMT] for its destination. 
  The U.S. coordinator handled the situation with humor. Lamb 
and the U.S. Embassy spokesman who was accompanying him remained 
in the VIP room during the inspection.
