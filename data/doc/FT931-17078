FT  02 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: US gives lift to drug shares
THE US authorities on Thursday delivered a year-end boost to the
pharmaceutical sector, granting approval to four products from UK companies
and sending shares in the recipient groups leaping smartly forward.
Of these, Fisons shares responded with the biggest percentage advance after
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it had approved the
group's Tilade asthma product.
Fisons said it intended selling the drug probably by the middle of 1993. The
market was also cheered by the company's announcement that it had agreed a
marketing arrangement for Tilade in the US with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. Fisons,
which will also co-promote Azmacort, RPR's steroid asthma treatment, in the
US, said the two drugs play a complementary role in contributing to the
successful treatment of asthma. The stock jumped 15 to 245p.
However, analysts cautioned against expecting any short-term benefit for
Fisons' earnings, arguing that the asthma treatment market was conservative
and that the marketing costs were likely to be high. But they also added
that the drug, one of the brightest hopes in Fisons' armoury, should help
turn round sentiment in the stock, which has suffered several setbacks in
the past year.
Boots received approval from the FDA for its Manoplax heart failure
treatment and the shares climbed 12 to 561p. Observers warned that, while
this was positive news, the drug's effect could be limited by the fact that
it was likely to be used in conjunction with other drugs, and not just on
its own. Manoplax received official blessings from UK authorities in August.
The third recipient of FDA approval was SmithKline Beecham, which won
consent for its Paxil anti-depressant treatment. The drug is seen as one of
the most important developments for the group.
Mr Andrew Porter, pharmaceuticals analyst at Nikko Europe, said: 'Since the
merger of the two companies and the consequent short-term benefits, the
market has been looking for something which would give the combined group
organic growth. Paxil is the one which will provide a basis for that.'
Analysts also added that Paxil was likely to be marketed at a discount to
rival Prozac in the US. Prozac, the market leader in anti-depressants,
manufactured by Eli Lilly, had sales of Dollars 550m in 1992 and was
expected to have sales of Dollars 600m in 1993.
SmithKline forged ahead 20 on the announcement before retreating to close at
496p, a rise of 12 on the day.
Amersham also received the FDA blessing for its Indiclor cancer treatment
and the stock advanced 17 to 619p.
Elsewhere in the sector, Glaxo, which gained FDA approval for its Imigran
drug on Tuesday, added 8 at 793p, while Wellcome moved forward 5 to 967p.
Worries continued over a price war between Britain's supermarkets. J.
Sainsbury had announced on Wednesday that it would cut prices on selected
items to combat similarly planned price promotions from the rival Tesco and
Argyll - which owns Safeway - chains. After tumbling heavily that day,
downward pressure continued on most of the stocks on Thursday, although
volumes were predictably thin.
Argyll slipped 5 to 393p, Kwik Save weakened 11 to 773p and Tesco softened 2
to 249p. After an initial decline, Sainsbury rallied to close 3 ahead on
balance at 564p.
Food manufacturers, which had suffered on the back of the Sainsbury move on
Wednesday, recovered some ground. United Biscuits improved 3 to 355p and
Tate &amp; Lyle 2 to 403p, while Associated British Foods appreciated 6 to 509p
and Cadbury-Schweppes ended 5 better at 444p.
Buttressed by Wall Street's firmness the previous night, leading oil issues
maintained the solid improvement of recent sessions, although business was
thin.
British Petroleum, 3 ahead at 247p, continued to benefit from hopes that
both the US dollar and global crude oil prices would rise in the new year.
But BP has been included in the market's list of probable rights issuers in
1993 and buying was muted.
Shell Transport fully sustained its status as one of the market's most
favoured stocks, although in the thin holiday trading conditions the shares
could manage to gain only 3 at 562p.
North Sea stocks had a quiet half-day session, with Enterprise Oil unable to
move from the overnight quotation of 441p. Enterprise has also found favour
in the stock market and is expected to respond readily to any signs of
increased activity in global economies, which would help crude oil prices.
Granada Group, one of the stocks tipped for a recovery buy in 1993,
continued its recent surge, appreciating 13 to 376p. Thorn EMI joined in the
recovery story, leaping 21 to 881p.
Holiday groups, heartened all week by reports of buoyant bookings, moved
higher. Owners Abroad put on 2 1/2 at 96 1/2 p, while Eurocamp gained 4 at
312p.
House builders continued to respond to reports that estate agents' business
had picked up in December. Bilton climbed 6 to 396p, Bellway 7 to 318p,
Bryant Group 4 to 108p, Persimmon 6 to 221p and Wilson Bowden 12 to 396p.
Selected stores shares again benefited from the reports of firm high street
sales. Austin Reed 'A' added 3 at 111p, Kingfisher 2 at 591p and Marks and
Spencer 1 1/2 at 329 1/2 p.
Others, however, ran into a bout of profit-taking. Ratners retreated 2 3/4
to 12 3/4 p, Storehouse 4 to 202p and Dixons Group 4 to 259p.
