IN BRIEF; 
GIOIOSA DENIES COCAINE CHARGES 
Thomas Gioiosa, who once lived with Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose and his 
family, pleaded innocent today to federal charges of tax evasion and conspiracy 
to distribute cocaine. 
U.S. Magistrate Robert Steinberg allowed Gioiosa, 31, to remain free on bond. 
If convicted, Gioiosa could face maximum penalties of 38 years in prison and $2 
million in fines. 
The five-count federal indictment accuses Gioiosa of income-tax evasion for the 
years 1985 and '86, and charges that he conspired to arrange cocaine deliveries 
from Florida to Cincinnati between January, 1985, and January, 1987.
