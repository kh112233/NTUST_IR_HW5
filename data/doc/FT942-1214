FT  25 JUN 94 / Mortars hit Red Cross hospital in Rwandan capital
A young boy salutes as he stands beside a UN soldier overseeing the
unloading of food aid in the Rwandan capital Kigali, which rebels yesterday
attacked, Reuter reports from Kigali. Their mortars hit the Red Cross
hospital and public market, causing dozens of casualties.
Meanwhile, in government-held western Rwanda, French troops on a
peacekeeping mission reached the north-western town of Gisenyi after several
reconnaissance missions around the town of Cyangugu in the south-west.
A first unit, entering from Bukavu in eastern Zaire, spent the night outside
the refugee camp of Nyarushishi near Cyangugu, checking conditions of the
estimated 8,000 Tutsi refugees sheltering in fear of massacre at the hands
of Hutu militiamen.
The first mission to an area where Tutsi refugees are in a majority was
apparently intended to show that France's Operation Turquoise would be
impartial despite past support for the Hutu government.
The commander of the operation, Brigadier Jean-Claude Lafourcade, told
reporters as he left Paris for Zaire he was determined to use force if
necessary to protect refugees from massacres which have claimed half a
million victims since April. 'My mandate allows me to use force to protect
civilians and I shall use it,' he said.
He expected his opponents to be disorganised gangs hunting refugees and not
the Tutsi-led Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF). The rebels have threatened to
oppose the controversial United Nations-backed operation, fearing that
France would use it to back the Hutu-led
government.
Paris, which launched the operation single-handedly because of lukewarm
international backing, has been at pains to make clear it will not take
sides in the civil war.
In Geneva, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees backed the
French intervention and said it was bracing for a fresh exodus of up to
500,000 people.
