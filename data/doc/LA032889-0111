JURY SELECTION TO BEGIN TODAY FOR HUNTER TRIAL 
Jury selection is set to begin today in the trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter, who 
is charged with fraud, conspiracy and income tax evasion stemming from the 
collapse of the J. David &amp; Co. investment firm, but much of the questioning 
of potential jurors will be done in private. 
U. S. District Judge Earl Gilliam said Monday that reporters will be barred 
from sessions where potential jurors are questioned individually about their 
views on a number of subjects, but did not specify what those subjects are. The 
potential jurors also will be asked to fill out a lengthy questionnaire 
intended to cut down on the amount of information they are asked to provide in 
questioning in open court. 
Lawyers involved in the case said later that the private sessions, in which 
potential jurors will be questioned outside the presence of other potential 
jurors, will deal with questions about pre-trial publicity and other matters. 
Gilliam said 119 potential jurors will be on hand today and a total of 300 will 
be available. 
Hunter was charged in November, 1986, in a 234-count indictment and faces 
another trial on an indictment returned in March, 1988, in which she is accused 
of 56 counts of conspiracy and using the mails to sell unregistered securities.
