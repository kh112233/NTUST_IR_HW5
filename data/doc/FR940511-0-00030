ACTION:

 Interim rule and request for comments.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) issues this interim regulation to limit public access, occupancy and use
of a portion of the O'Malley River drainage and adjacent lands bordering Karluk Lake and O'Malley Lake within the Kodiak
National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge). Public use of a parcel of land and water consisting of approximately 3,955 acres
will be restricted from June 25, 1994, through September 30, 1994, to individuals participating in a refuge-sponsored
bear viewing program. 


This closure is necessary to prevent incompatible conflicts between people and brown bears at an important bear concentration
area, during the season when conflicts and impacts on bears are most prevalent. It is intended to control increasing
human use of a very important bear concentration area so that human uses in the area remain compatible with refuge purposes.
Research and experience have clearly demonstrated that control of human activity in major bear concentration areas
is necessary to avoid conflicts between people and bears. Organized bear viewing programs elsewhere in Alaska have
proven highly successful in reducing conflict to an acceptable level while maintaining quality public use opportunities.
This action will allow quality public viewing and photography opportunities through the O'Malley Bear Viewing Program
without adversely affecting bear use of this important feeding area. After a thorough evaluation of the bear viewing
program conducted during 1994, the Service will decide whether to continue the program. 

A proposed rule that would provide a permanent seasonal restriction on public access is being published elsewhere
in this separate part of the 

Federal Register

 with this interim rule.
