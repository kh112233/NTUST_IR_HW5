FT  20 OCT 92 / EC adopts law on maternity pay
European Community ministers yesterday formally agreed on a law which will
guarantee women across the Community a minimum level of maternity leave and
pay, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Under the law, adopted without further discussion at a meeting of EC
ministers, pregnant and breastfeeding women will be guaranteed 14 weeks'
wages at a minimum of statutory sick pay. The plan will result in big
improvements in only a small number of EC countries, notably Britain,
Ireland and Portugal.
