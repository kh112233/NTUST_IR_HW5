FT  18 AUG 93 / De Larosiere secure as president of EBRD
THE Bank of France governor, Mr Jacques de Larosiere, will be named new
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development tomorrow.
The bank was set up in 1991 to make investments in eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union.
The election process to replace Mr Jacques Attali, who quit last month amid
claims of extravagant spending at the EBRD, does not formally end till the
close of business today. However, Mr de Larosiere yesterday became the only
candidate when Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the former Polish finance minister,
withdrew.
However, an EBRD executive said the Frenchman had already secured enough
votes.
The bank is owned by 56 countries and international agencies. More than 50
per cent of its share capital is owned by the Group of Seven leading
industrial countries, which have voted for Mr de Larosiere. The successful
candidate needs a majority measured both by countries and by shares.
Mr Attali has returned to Paris where he is working from an office at the
conseil d'etat, which advises the French government on constitutional
issues.
One of Mr de Larosiere's first tasks will be to reassess the bank's mandate,
to determine whether it should invest a greater proportion of its capital in
the public sector and whether it should take greater risks.
