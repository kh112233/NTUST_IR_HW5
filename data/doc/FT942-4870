FT  08 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Setback for Spanish economy
An unexpected growth in imports halted the improvement in the current
account of Spain's balance of payments in April. The monthly shortfall was
marginally higher than the previous April at Pta222bn despite a sharp rise
in income from tourism and other services. But the accumulated deficit for
the first four months was still 30 per cent lower than the same period last
year at Pta378bn (Pounds 1.82bn), according to provisional Bank of Spain
figures. This reflected a 39 per cent upsurge in exports and an increased
surplus from services and transfers. Tourists receipts were 20 per cent up.
Some analysts believe that despite the latest figures this year could still
produce a current account surplus, the first since 1986, the year of Spain's
accession to the EU. Spain's gold and foreign currency reserves meanwhile
decreased by Dollars 394m in May to Dollars 44.3bn, showing a total decline
of Dollars 933m since the beginning of the year. David White, Madrid
