  [Text] A dangeorus situation is developing in St. 
Petersburg as regards the number of cases of diphtheria. Last 
year the disease proved fatal for 51 St. Petersburgers -- none 
of the dead had been innoculated -- including six children. 
  Commenting on the lamentable statistics for infectious 
diseases, experts point to the steady rise in such diseases as 
tuberculosis, syphilis, and gonorrhea. Deaths from dysentery 
also rose: Last year 172 St. Petersburgers died. The number of 
cases of viral hepatitis was up 80 percent, with the number of 
St. Petersburgers who died from the disease doubling last year. 
  Experts so far see no grounds for an improvement in the 
epidemiological situation in St. Petersburg although special 
programs to combat the most widespread diseases are being 
formulated and implemented at federal and municipal levels.
