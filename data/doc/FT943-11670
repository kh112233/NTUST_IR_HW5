FT  29 JUL 94 / Anti-personnel mine curb by UK
The UK government, faced with mounting evidence of the tragedy caused by
anti-personnel mines, has announced a ban on the export of all such weapons,
except high-technology models which are primed to self-destruct.
The 'self-destructing' variety of mine is supposed to avoid the risk of
civilians being accidentally killed after hostilities have ceased.
More than 100m mines have been scattered around the battlefields of the
world, and the United Nations estimates that at least 800 people die every
month as a result of stepping on them. Worst affected countries include
Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia and Iraq.
Britain has not in practice sold any mines since 1985. However, this week's
announcement is apparently intended to bolster the UK's authority in
international negotiations over the trade. It amounts to an undertaking that
sales of the cruder variety of mine will not be resumed for an indefinite
period.
It does, however, leave open the possibility of developing and exporting the
self-destructing model. The Mines Advisory Group, a British charity which
helps clear minefields, described the decision as 'cynical and misleading'.
It said the failure rate of self-destructing mines was unacceptably high.
More than 1m supposedly self-destructing mines had remained live after the
Gulf war, and similar weapons dropped on Laos by US aircraft 25 years ago
were still claiming lives. The Foreign Office said it would be encouraging
other countries to follow its example and abide by an agreed code of conduct
on mine exports. Italy, the world's third largest exporter of anti-personnel
mines, recently promised a blanket ban on their production and export.
US and UK policy has focused more on a 'technical solution' to the question
of mines, arguing that it is possible to calibrate the weapons in such a way
as to make them harmless after their military purpose has been served.
