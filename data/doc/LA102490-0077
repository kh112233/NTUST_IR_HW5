A BLOCK THAT RESTS ON SHARING; 
NEIGHBORHOOD: THE RESIDENTS OF MONROVIA'S OAKCLIFF ROAD KEEP THE STREET'S 
FRIENDLY SPIRIT ALIVE BY DOING THINGS TOGETHER. 
Just below Monrovia's canyons runs Oakcliff Road, a bastion of neighborliness 
and stability. 
The Northeast Monrovia cul-de-sac of about 30 homes is known for its block 
events. In addition to annual New Year's Eve parties, residents each March hold 
a back-yard sale, where anything from plastic kitchenware to Art Deco lamps can 
be picked up at bargain prices. 
"Often," chuckled Charlotte Schamadan, 41, "we buy things from each other that 
we put up for sale ourselves a year or two later." 
Schamadan and her husband, Lee, run a graphics design business from their home 
and create posters for civic festivities. 
"We're the newcomers on the street," she said. "We've lived here only 11 
years." 
Queen Esther and Willie Hawkins moved to Oakcliff Road in 1970. "We bought the 
house because we liked it. We especially liked the kitchen and the three 
bathrooms," Queen Esther Hawkins said. 
Jane Course, 69, who throws holiday coffee parties for the neighbors, said she 
and her husband, Ben, are among the earliest residents of the street. They 
moved there in 1958. Soon after, in 1961, came the Piderits, Pete and Betty. 
Pete Piderit, 67, a retired IBM executive, is chairman of the Neighborhood 
Watch. When he isn't busy tending his hydroponic tomato patch (the tomatoes are 
planted in ceramic pebbles and watered four times a day), Piderit runs a 
Monrovia dance group, which meets annually in his light-green stucco home. 
Most residents agree they couldn't afford to buy on the street now. The 
ranch-style homes, predominantly three-bedroom-and-den, sell for upward of 
$300,000. 
Oakcliff Road was once in the apron of a lush forest, where Indians 
occasionally hunted and fished. It is topped by 5,409-foot Monrovia Peak, and 
grooving southward along rocky creeks and streams are what are known now as 
Monrovia and Sawpit canyons. 
Just below the junction of the two, a deep "saw pit" was once dug. According to 
legend, Franciscan priests and Indian laborers hauled lumber down the mountain 
for the construction of the San Gabriel Mission, and crouched together in the 
pit to saw it. It's said they also dug mysterious, long tunnels found in 
Norumbrega Canyon in 1934. 
The pit, which has long since disappeared, was there when the earliest settlers 
arrived in the area. The first known were the Rankins -- Hibbard and Polly -- 
who came in 1874 with their four children. They built a cabin in the canyon and 
earned their living sawing wood in the saw pit. 
Later, the cabin was destroyed by fire and flood, and typhoid fever claimed 
three of their children. The triple tombstones remain at the top of Canyon 
Boulevard, Monrovia Historical Society President Steve Baker said. However, 
after an incident of vandalism about two years ago, the grave markers were 
restored and permanently placed to lie flat, he said. 
After the city of Monrovia was established in 1886, a reservoir was built in 
Sawpit Canyon. William N. Monroe, of Scott County, Ind., a Civil War cavalry 
scout and railroad entrepreneur who is considered Monrovia's founding father, 
secured the water rights to the two canyons as one of his first official acts 
as mayor. Later, he built a burro trail up the canyon to what is now Deer Park. 
In 1905, Ben Overturff of Selma, Iowa, stumbled upon Deer Park while on a 
hunting trip, and fell in love with the idyllic glen. Toting supplies, 
burro-style, up the trial, he built Deer Park Lodge, where, it is said, guests 
would arrive to find beans on the stove and Mrs. Overturff's lemon pies on the 
table. 
Sawpit Canyon saw many changes over the years -- mainly the construction of 
Sawpit Dam in 1928 and '29. In the 1930s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers 
extended Sawpit Canyon Road to link up with fire roads around Monrovia Peak. 
Today, the 13-square-mile city of Monrovia has about 35,000 residents. 
Even though crime in the city has gone up in recent years, the people on 
Oakcliff Road say they feel safe on the street. Many look for signs that 
someone's out of town, and then keep a watchful eye on the house. 
"I like the quiet, the mountain backdrop and the small-town atmosphere here," 
Jane Course said. 
Charlotte Schamadan added: "The neighbors are wonderful. And Monrovia is the 
best-kept secret in the San Gabriel Valley."
