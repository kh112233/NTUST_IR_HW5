U.S. TIGHTENS SKY TERRORISM CURBS 
The Transportation Department today announced new measures to combat sky 
terrorism after a meeting with President Bush by relatives of Americans killed 
in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland. 
Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told a news conference that airlines 
will be required to acknowledge all Federal Aviation Administration security 
bulletins within 24 hours, and compliance with them would be mandatory. 
Such bulletins tell airlines of possible threats and recommend steps that can 
be taken to avert them. In the past, such recommendations generally have been 
advisory. Skinner also said airlines will be required to install equipment to 
detect plastic explosives in all high-risk airports throughout the world. (Bush
