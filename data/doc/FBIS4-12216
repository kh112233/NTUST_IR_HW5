  [Text] Nicosia, April 5 (AFP) -- Gunmen shot and seriously 
wounded a Danish UN guard in an ambush Tuesday [5 April] in 
Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq, security officials in the area 
said. 
  The guard was shot in the chest as he was driving from 
al-Sulaymaniyah to Irbil, and later underwent an operation, said 
the sources contacted by telephone from Cyprus. They did not 
give any information about the assailants. 
  The attack came only two days after an AFP correspondent, 
German-born Lissy Schmidt, and her bodyguard were killed by 
unidentified gunmen in the al-Sulaymaniyah area close to the 
Iranian border. 
  Since the start of the year the UN has reported 13 attacks 
against foreigners in Iraqi Kurdistan, which have left one 
person dead and seven wounded. 
  One of the main Iraqi Kurdish groups, the Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK), said earlier in a statement from Damascus that 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's regime had "promised a reward of 
10,000 dollars to anyone killing a foreigner in Kurdistan." 
  Schmidt was the only foreign journalist permanently based in 
Iraqi Kurdistan, controlled by the Kurds since their uprising 
against the Baghdad regime following the January-February 1991 
Gulf War.
