  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Russia's frontier forces may 
open fire on Japanese ships if they violate Russian territorial 
waters, the commander-in-chief of the forces said Thursday [3 
February]. The commander, Andrey Nikolayev, told reporters in 
Tokyo that about 130 Japanese fishing boats entered waters near 
the four Russian-held islands claimed by Japan on January 21 and 
22 in defiance of Russian border patrols, he said. 
  Nikolayev criticized these violations as damaging bilateral 
relations, and said if such violations continue to occur Russian 
forces will act on the basis of a Russian law which allows them 
to use arms against border violators, he said. 
  A high-ranking official of the frontier forces has said the 
alleged violations were a premeditated provocation with a 
political purpose. 
  Nikolayev, however, denied the political angle, saying the 
boats had entered Russian waters apparently for economic reasons. 
  The former Soviet Union occupied the four islands off 
Japan's 
northernmost main island of Hokkaido at the end of World War II, 
and Japan has constantly urged their return. 
  Nikolayev said Russian border guards video-taped the 
incidents and he is ready to give the tape to the Japanese 
Government through diplomatic channels. Tokyo is investigating 
the alleged violations in response to Moscow's protest.
