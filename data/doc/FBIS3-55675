  [Text] Tuesday, January 11 -- Finance Minister Madis Urike 
and his associates held a news conference yesterday, describing 
their past work as satisfactory. 
  The ministry succeeded in its main tasks last year -- to 
lead 
a strict monetary policy and to cut the inflation, to balance 
the budget, to prepare draft laws and to perform the role of an 
"economic policeman", Minister Urike said. Chancellor Enn Pant 
added that the ministry had completed the taxation reform, 
compiled four budgets and submitted 58 draft laws. He rejected 
Prime Minister Mart Laar's accusations of the ministry's 
insufficient support to reforms, stressing that it would be 
unfair to demand more of the ministry. Deputy Chancellor Tiit 
Saat announced that up to 20 percent of profits go untaxed, but 
Pant stressed that the enterprises' unpaid taxes have been 
reduced as compared to 1992. 
  Urike added that the national investment programme will be 
prepared by February. The review of foreign aid in 1993 has not 
been completed as yet, but the approximate amount had been 
similar to that of 1992 -- 1.1 milliard kroons. Most of it is 
used on business trips and foreign consultants, he added.
