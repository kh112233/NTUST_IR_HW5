FT  25 JAN 94 / Parts makers set for VW boost
Component purchases in the UK by the Volkswagen group could rise to Pounds
400m this year, double the level of two years ago, UK-based executives of
the German carmaker indicated yesterday.
The estimate follows a visit by Dr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the
Volkswagen group's purchasing director. He arrived in the UK last week to
offer 360 senior executives of the UK's motor components industry the
prospect of substantially more business with VW.
Dr Lopez, the former General Motors purchasing director still embroiled in
industrial espionage allegations, told a meeting of components companies'
executives that he was hoping for a tenfold increase in quotations from
potential UK suppliers.
Volkswagen, engaged in a struggle to cut component costs and improve
productivity in Germany, has embarked on what Dr Lopez describes as a
'global sourcing policy' in pursuit of high-quality, low-cost parts.
Supplies from the UK have become an increasingly attractive prospect for
Volkswagen.
This is partly because of cost-competitiveness helped by sterling's
devaluation against the D-mark.
However, the components industry is also judged to have benefited
substantially in quality terms from its links with Japanese 'transplant'
factories in the UK.
These encouraged Volkswagen last year to set up a separate components
purchasing department at its Milton Keynes headquarters. This now employs
nearly 20 people and last year purchases rose to Pounds 300m.
Dr Lopez said VW had installed a computerised response mechanism, ensuring a
response within two weeks to all component quotations. VW is also making
available teams of its own engineers to suppliers needing to improve design
or other efficiencies. One such team has been active in the UK since
October.
Germany's other two indigenous car makers, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, have also
been increasing their components purchases from UK suppliers, although from
a smaller base than VW.
