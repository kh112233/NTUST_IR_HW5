BRIEFLY 
Bristol-Myers, Squibb Holders OK Merger: Bristol-Myers Co. and Squibb Corp. 
stockholders approved their companies' $11.5-billion merger into Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co., which will be world's second-largest pharmaceuticals company. The 
merger is a further step in the consolidation of the global pharmaceuticals 
industry. Analysts say mergers are encouraged by the industry's stiff 
competition and development costs of hundreds of millions of dollars for the 
introduction of a single drug. The merger will take effect today, Bristol-Myers 
officials said. The combined company will be headquartered in New York.
