WORLD IN BRIEF; 
COLOMBIA; 
DRUG LORDS TARGET EUROPE, REPORT SAYS 
Colombian drug cartels and the Mafia are building a cocaine empire in Western 
European countries, which have replaced the United States as the biggest market 
for the drug, Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper reported, citing a joint study by 
the international police organization Interpol and the Colombian intelligence 
police. The Bogota offices of both Interpol and the intelligence police were 
closed Sunday, and no one could be reached for comment. The European market 
will continue to grow because of the Italian Mafia's intention to preserve its 
distribution monopoly and the Colombian cartels' desire to capture part of the 
market, according to the study.
