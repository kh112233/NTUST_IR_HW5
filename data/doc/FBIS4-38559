  [Text] Tallinn, May 31, BNS -- Estonia signed an agreement 
Friday with the Swedish Government on a 10 million U.S. dollar 
loan, the Estonian Embassy in Stockholm said. 
  The loan is part of an extensive World Bank loan scheme 
aimed 
for the renovation of Estonia's heating systems. 
  Because of the large size of the project, part of the loan 
for carrying it out comes from the Swedish Government and the 
European Investment Bank. 
  Estonia signed a 38.4 million dollar loan agreement with the 
World Bank Friday. 
  Negotiations with the European Investment Bank on financing 
the same project are under way in Luxembourg today and tomorrow. 
  The project foresees the retrofitting of a number of 
municipal heating systems in Tallinn, Tartu and Parnu toward 
more fuel economy and using of local fuels. The money also goes 
to major repairs on Tallinn's major boiler-house of Iru and 
transition to local fuels in about 40 smaller boiler-houses all 
over the country.
