FT  27 APR 91 / Many companies seek leave to build wind farms
THE GOVERNMENT has a strong application list from companies wanting to build
wind farms to supply electricity as an alternative source of power.
Together their schemes would generate twice as much electricity as Mr John
Wakeham, energy secretary, envisaged for this year's applications.
Wind farms consist of collections of turbines powered by the wind.
Electricity is produced when the wind turns blades connected to a generator.
Among the bidders are PowerGen and National Power, the privatised power
companies, which rely primarily on fossil fuels. The largest is the Wind
Energy Group, a company jointly owned by Taylor Woodrow Construction and
British Aerospace.
Companies have recently finished bidding for inclusion in the 1991 tranche
of the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO). Under this system,
renewable-energy projects - such as wind power - and nuclear projects are
supported by a levy on the power industry.
Mr Wakeham said he expected between 60MW and 120MW to be included in the
NFFO round this year. The bids submitted have topped 250MW. That is
equivalent to about 800 wind turbines compared with about 40 at present in
operation in England and Wales.
The Wind Energy Group has applied for 90MW involving 300 turbines on 14
sites.
