  [Text] Munich (DDP/ADN) -- Munich's Mayor Christian Ude has 
banned all [political] meetings on the eve of the Kurd trial 
tomorrow [in Munich]. The relevant instructions have already 
been issued, a district administrative department spokesman said 
today. Ude thus is following the advice of the police and the 
authorities, who warned that protests on a massive scale are 
expected from those associated with the Workers Party of 
Kurdistan, PKK, at the start of the trial of 13 Kurds, who 
attacked the Turkish Consulate General in Munich in June last 
year and took 21 people hostage. 
  About 2,500 police officers and Federal Border Guard units 
are to assemble in Munich by this evening to provide protection, 
a Munich police headquarters spokesman said today in response to 
an enquiry.
