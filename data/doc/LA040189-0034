HILLCREST RESTAURANT'S PATRONS WARNED OF HEPATITIS THREAT FROM INFECTED WORKER 
Patrons who ate certain foods at Alberto's Mexican Food restaurant at 409 
Washington St. in Hillcrest from March 18 through Wednesday may develop Type A 
hepatitis unless they receive proper treatment, San Diego County health 
officials warned Friday. 
Customers of the restaurant who ate raw lettuce, tomatoes, onions or salsa 
during that period, or who ate guacamole between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m., may have 
contracted the hepatitis from a restaurant worker who prepared those foods, 
said Nancy Bowen, acting county health officer for the Department of Health 
Services. 
Restaurant patrons are advised to receive a gamma globulin shot, which boosts 
the body's natural immune system, within two weeks of infection. "The shot 
arrests the symptoms," said Elaine Schmidt, health educator for the health 
department. 
The symptoms of the disease, which can take from 15 to 50 days to develop, 
include sudden fever, tiredness, nausea, abdominal discomfort and loss of 
appetite, followed in a couple of days by jaundice. 
"There are people who may have been exposed but may not yet have symptoms. If 
you already have symptoms, there's not much point in getting the gamma 
globulin. . . . If it's past the two-week period, just get plenty of rest, eat 
well and don't strain yourself. People can recover in as quickly as a week," 
Schmidt said. 
The virus can be transmitted through contaminated water, shellfish from 
contaminated water and by workers who do not have good hygiene habits, Schmidt 
said. "It's transmitted fecal-to-food, so if someone doesn't wash their hands 
after going to the bathroom, that's how you can get it." 
The unidentified worker has not returned to work since Wednesday.
