FT  25 APR 94 / Four Algerian rebels killed in police sweep
Algerian security forces said yesterday they had killed four Islamic
militants during a two-day sweep of Moslem fundamentalist strongholds,
according to the official Algerian APS news agency, Reuter reports from
Tunis.
APS said soldiers also arrested 61 people suspected of belonging to or
supporting armed Islamic groups.
Algerian Radio said a large cement factory, which was badly damaged by two
bombs on Friday, would be out of commission for three months. It said 10
Islamic militants were involved in the attack on the plant at Meftah, 12
miles south-east of Algiers.
The army-backed Algerian authorities have blamed Islamic militants, battling
to set up an Islamic state in the North African country, for various acts of
sabotage of economic installations since 1992.
The latest deaths bring to around 500 the number of Islamists reported
killed in Algeria since March.
