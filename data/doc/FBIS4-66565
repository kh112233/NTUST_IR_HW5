<F P=106> [Editorial: "Printing of Counterfeit Currency in Tribal </F>
Areas" all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] According to one news report, U.S. intelligence, 
which has been investigating the circulation of 10 million U.S. 
dollars all over the world, has provided the federal Home 
Minister Nasirullah Babar some solid proofs of printing machines 
in operation in tribal areas printing U.S. and Pakistani 
currency. According to this report, paper for this purpose is 
imported from Hungary which is cleared in Peshawar's "dry port." 
It is believed that many influential persons are involved in 
this currency scandal. 
  It is not necessary to mention here the role counterfeit 
currency plays in destroying a country's economy. It was often 
heard in the past that some enemy nations through their 
notorious intelligence agencies were involved in printing 
counterfeit currency and spreading it in our tribal and border 
areas. Some individuals are said to be involved in this wicked 
trade in other parts of the country also. However, the 
information about large-scale and organized efforts to print 
U.S. and Pakistani currency that the U.S. intelligence agency 
has provided to our home ministry appears to be a major 
conspiracy to destroy our national economy. It is possible that 
some foreign hand is behind it. The government should 
immediately investigate this serious situation and take strict 
action against the involved people regardless of their position 
and influence. It should also inform the people of the results 
of this action so that they are aware of what progress has been 
made in this context.
