FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Higher orders boost Mackie
Shares in Mackie International rose 12p to 214p yesterday after the
Belfast-based precision engineering group announced sharply increased orders
for its textile machinery and environmental controls equipment.
The company, whose September flotation on the Unlisted Securities Market was
hailed as a sign of growing business confidence in Northern Ireland
following the IRA ceasefire, said it had won orders worth Pounds 9m - almost
matching its total first half sales.
Mr Pat Dougan, chief executive and holder of 20 per cent of the equity, said
the orders would both boost sales and secure the jobs of the group's 380
workers.
'We will press ahead with an Pounds 8m project to install new equipment,
which could lead to another 50 jobs,' he said.
The announcement was welcomed in west Belfast, the UK's worst unemployment
blackspot, where Mackie is the only surviving precision engineering group.
'The company looked as though it was on the way out a few years ago, but it
has been turned round successfully,' said Mr Joe Hendron, MP for west
Belfast.
In the two years to 1991, sales dropped from Pounds 30m to Pounds 6m before
the Northern Ireland Office helped rescue the company and appointed Mr
Dougan.
The upturn in orders is expected to push pre-tax profits up to Pounds 3.5m
on sales of about Pounds 30m next year, against forecasts this year of
Pounds 1.9m profits and turnover of Pounds 19m.
