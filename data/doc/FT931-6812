FT  27 FEB 93 / Airport baggage security to be tightened
TOUGH new baggage security measures for all British airports were announced
by the government yesterday.
The measures will eventually ensure that all hold baggage will be X-rayed
and every piece of luggage put on board an aircraft will be matched to a
passenger.
Lord Caithness, the transport minister, said a directive setting out the
scheme to match baggage would be issued by the end of June. He hoped it
could come into effect by the end of the year.
Unaccompanied baggage or any item that could not be accounted for would be
subjected to stringent security controls before it was authorised to be
carried, he said.
Lord Caithness, who was attending an aviation security symposium near
Manchester Airport, said the total screening of hold baggage by special
X-ray machines would take three to 3 1/2 years to introduce. The cost of the
exercise is understood to be the main reason for phasing.
Manchester Airport's Pounds 265m Terminal 2, which opens next week and has
state-of-the-art equipment, has 27 of the new X-ray machines for which it
paid more than Pounds 2m. Mr David Teale, technical services director, said
more machines would be needed - at a cost of at least Pounds 60,000 each.
'We think the government should be helping the airports and the airlines to
meet some of the costs,' he said.
The new machines are situated immediately behind check-in desks. Before
getting their boarding cards passengers can be called into a secure area to
open their baggage for inspection if required.
Matching passengers to baggage is already done manually at most airports,
although Manchester will examine whether this can be automated using
bar-coded labels now attached to luggage for automated sorting and handling.
