AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY 
The bill creating Yosemite National Park was signed into law Oct. 1, 1890. By 
1906, President Theodore Roosevelt had visited the park, hiked to Bridalveil 
Falls with John Muir and added Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Sequoia Grove 
to the park's acreage. 
On a typical mid-summer weekend, there are 3,320 tourists per square mile in 
Yosemite Valley. 
Ansel Adams worked as Yosemite's publicist / photographer when he moved there 
in 1927; in the next thirty years he shot more than 40,000 park images. 
The Ahwahnichi (meaning "people who live in the valley shaped like a big 
mouth") Indians inhabited Yosemite Valley as early as the1500s. In 1625, there 
were 2,000 Ahwahnichi Indians; the last Ahwahnichi family left Yosemite in 
1969. 
Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock made a famous on-camera "ascent" of El Capitan in 
"Star Trek V." Stunt climbers were used for the rock-face scenes, and the two 
actors, William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, were helicoptered to the summit for 
the finale. 
The first ascent of the back of Half Dome, using ropes and eyebolts, was in 
1875. In 1919, Sierra Club members replaced those with the rock's first cable 
ladder-cum-walkway. 
Naturalist Johnn Muir was 30 when he first came to Yosemite Valley via 
Inspiration Point in 1868; he had sailed from the Gulf of Mexico to San 
Francisco and from there hiked 200 miles into the valley. He once rode half a 
mile on a Sierra snow avalanche, living to write: "Elija's flight in a chariot 
of fire could hardly have been more exciting." 
Exhaust, traffic jams and high tempers led to the 1972 start of the valley 
shuttle-bus service to stores, restaurants and museums. Today, the average wait 
for a shuttle is eight minutes. 
Seventy-seven species of mammals live in Yosemite National Park. The most 
common is the deer mouse; the rarest is the wolverine. In 1892, Yosemite banned 
grizzly bear hunting, and that same year the Department of Fish and Game 
introduced rainbow trout to the park's streams and lakes. 
Each evening at sundown, park rangers used to fill a large chicken-wire ball 
with redwood bark and set it afire, and hurl it off Glacier Point to create the 
famous Yosemite fire fall. The spectacular sight was canceled in 1968 when 
spectator traffic jams filled the valley floor. It had been a park tradition 
since 1872. 
During Yosemite's third decade, rangers coaxed bears into the valley to eat 
garbage and frolic for spectators. The popular tourist attraction was 
discontinued in 1941, after the bears began to stay past showtime. The bears, 
however, had learned that where there were humans, there was food. By 1975, the 
number of reported human-bear incidents rose to 860; that year, rangers shot 
and killed six Yosemite bears. Not long after, the Human-Bear Management Plan, 
which educated people and marked troublesome bears for relocation in the high 
country, was developed. 
Yosemite rangers started carrying guns in 1967 -- "It was during the hippie era 
and you never knew what you would encounter," remembers one -- and still carry 
them today. The 1970 Steadman Meadow affair also marked the hippie era. Rangers 
were accused of brutality when they used riot sticks to disperse hundreds of 
young people gathered for the July 4th weekend; 174 were arrested. 
Yosemite Valley was the first runner-up as the site of the 1932 Winter 
Olympics. The Games were held in Lake Placid. 
Each year, about 1,200 climbing parties attempt to scale El Capitan, 3,593 feet 
above the valley floor. Fewer than half make it to the top. There are 200 
routes up the famous rock's face; the fastest party to reach the summit did it 
in six hours this year. 
The first car drove into the park in 1900, but most early visitors rode the 
Central Pacific Railroad from Stockton to within miles of the park entrance. 
The rest of the journey into the valley was completed in horse-drawn 
stagecoaches. In 1913, when car access began in ernest, the speed limit on 
curves was 6 miles per hour. 
Parachuting off El Capitan was briefly permitted in 1970, but was eventually 
considered too dangerous and outlawed in 1980. In 1973, stunt skier Rick 
Sylvester became the first -- and only -- person to ski-parachute off El 
Capitan. When he landed he was arrested and charged with illegal flight. 
On a peak visitor day, the general store in Yosemite Village will sell 450 
rolls of camera film. 
John Muir considered the Hetch-Hetchy Valley, on the park's northern boundary, 
even more beautiful than Yosemite Valley, and when the Hetch-Hetchy Dam was 
approved in 1914, he left the park heartbroken. He died of pneumonia the 
following year and never saw the flooded valley. The dam was completed in 1934, 
sending water to San Francisco taps. 
Every year, Yosemite hosts the Bracebridge Dinner, a traditional English 
Christmas supper served by costumed actors in the Great Lounge of the Ahwahnee. 
The first dinner was held the year the Ahwahnee opened, and the lead role of 
Squire Bracebridge was played by photographer Ansel Adams. 
When the Ahwahnee Hotel opened in 1927, a room cost $6 a night and included 
maid service and a chauffeur. Today, rooms go for nearly $200 a night, and it's 
almost impossible to get reservations less than a year ahead of time. 
As part of a tourist package, the Curry Co. in 1924 created Indian Field Days, 
a "festival and rodeo to celebrate the colorful culture of the park's original 
inhabitants." The Ahwahnichi, fewer than 15 families who lived at 
government-owned Camp Sunnyside in the park, demonstrated basketry and weaving, 
competed in a "cutest Indian baby" contest and performed native dances for a 
mostly Anglo audience. Indian Field Days ended in 1929 amid criticism calling 
the event exploitative. 
A raging fire ignited by lightning charred close to 13,000 park acres this past 
August. Aggressive firefighting, which snuffed the blaze in two weeks, caused 
some grumblings in the Park Service, which contends that natural fires should 
be allowed to burn unchecked in parts of the park. 
Galen Clark, appointed Yosemite's first superintendent in 1866, was paid $500 a 
year and lived rent-free on parkland; Michael Finley, the current 
superintendent, is paid $69,086 and rents National Park Service housing for 
$487.54 a month.
