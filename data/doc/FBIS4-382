  [Excerpts] The airlift established in Kigali, the capital 
of Rwanda, has made it possible to evacuate a significant number 
of French civilians in the face of the threat of a civil war, 
which is getting more real every hour despite statements about a 
cease-fire agreement between the rebels of the Patriotic Front 
and government troops. [passage omitted] 
  Apparently, some 4,000 rebels resumed the offensive this 
afternoon to try and take the capital, Kigali. According to 
some reports, nearly 20,000 people have died in the country 
since the beginning of the conflict. A first consequence: 
fighting, which seems to have decreased... [pauses] We are not 
sure about that for the time being, because we are getting 
contradictory reports every minute. Colonel Luc Marchal, the 
commander of the Belgian UN troops in Rwanda, has just confirmed 
-- although he is still unsure -- that weapons, with few 
exceptions, are reported to have gone silent. The UN officer 
spoke to Benoit Colombin: 
  [Begin recording] [Marchal] There has not been any fighting 
since this morning. Around 1000 hours, there was a cease-fire, 
and, apart from limited and sporadic shooting, the cease-fire 
has been respected throughout the town. 
  [Colombin] Do you think that it will be respected? Indeed, 
there have already been cease-fires. 
  [Marchal] Indeed, there was a cease-fire yesterday, but it 
was a verbal cease-fire that was not based on the prospect of 
negotiations. This is no longer the case. This was negotiated; 
there is a written text. I agree that cease-fires are only bits 
of paper and that everything depends on the way the units are 
controlled on the ground. 
  [Colombin] Why can the French only be evacuated by air? 
  [Marchal] Because only the French have been given permission 
to land and to take off. There has been a new government for 
two days now. These authorities -- who are competent -- made 
the decision. [end recording] [passage omitted]
