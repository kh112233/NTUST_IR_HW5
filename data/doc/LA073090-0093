IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION 
DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK. 
Government Sues Grower Accused of Slavery: The Labor Department filed a lawsuit 
Wednesday against a Ventura County flower grower indicted on slavery charges, 
alleging that he owes at least $1 million in unpaid wages to about 400 illegal 
aliens. The U.S. District Court suit was filed against Griffith-Ives Co., an 
ornamental flower business, and its owner, Edwin M. Ives of Los Angeles. 
Ives, his company and seven others are awaiting trial on 15 counts of slavery 
at the 50-acre farm in Somis, Calif. The civil suit alleges that about 400 
workers were grossly underpaid in violation of federal labor laws. The suit 
claims that Ives made inflated deductions from workers' pay for virtually 
everything -- including toilet paper and haircuts -- and seeks double the 
amount of back wages owed to workers. (Filed July 25, 2990. Case No. 90-3932)
