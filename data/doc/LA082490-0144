DRIVER KILLED WHEN CAR HITS PARKED VAN 
An Iowa motorist was killed early Thursday when her car drifted into a center 
divider and slammed into a paramedic van that was parked on the San Diego 
Freeway. 
Tanya Irlmeier, 19, of Audubon, Iowa, was driving south at 1:30 a.m. near the 
Sand Canyon Avenue off-ramp when the accident occurred, California Highway 
Patrol Officer Keith Thornhill said. 
For an undetermined reason, she veered her Toyota Cressida into the emergency 
lane, where an Orange County Fire Department paramedic van was parked, 
Thornhill said. 
The paramedics had parked the van in the lane to retrieve a piece of equipment 
left after an earlier minor traffic collision, Thornhill said. Two members of 
the paramedic crew were standing along the freeway when Irlmeier rear-ended the 
van, but neither was injured. 
She was killed instantly.
