FT  29 JUN 92 / Letter: Wrong to assume that all hostages in Lebanon have
been freed
Sir, I agree wholeheartedly with Observer's assessment of Mr Giandomenico
Picco ('Smart choice', June 23). The outgoing UN hostage negotiator has done
a tremendous service to the cause of world freedom.
However, international media such as the Financial Times have done a
disservice by assuming the 'last of the western hostages' have been
released, now that two German hostages have returned home.
Henriette Haddad, a Canadian-Lebanese dual citizen, was kidnapped on
September 26 1985, in west Beirut. There is no substantive proof she is
dead. Actually, a mountain of evidence suggests she is still alive, and held
by fundamentalists in the Bekaa Valley. Mr Picco added her to his list of
hostages on March 31 last. Several cases of other westerners have never been
resolved: Alberto Molinari, an Italian kidnapped on September 11 1985;
Florence Raad, a French-Lebanese dual citizen kidnapped in May 1985; Alec
Collett, a British journalist working for UNRWA, kidnapped in March of the
same year.
We might also consider that the distinction, western/Middle Eastern, is an
arbitrary one. Lebanese hostages, who may well number in the hundreds, no
less deserve our support and sympathy. We must not bury people until they
are proven dead.
