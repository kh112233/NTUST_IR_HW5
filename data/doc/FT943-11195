FT  01 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Egypt safer
The UK government says the security situation has improved in Egypt, where
two tourists have been killed and 30 wounded in attacks by Moslem militants
since 1992. Mr Tony Baldry, assistant foreign secretary, said after a visit
to Cairo, that the authorities now had the upper hand.
However, visitors should still avoid Assiut in southern Egypt - the region
where the militant Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) had been most active.
Yesterday the group said it had wounded two policemen near the southern town
of Mallawi in a revenge attack for the killing of two Gama'a members by
police.
