FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Gas signs 20-year contract in the
Caribbean
BRITISH GAS has expanded its international activities by signing a 20-year
contract to supply the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago from its
Dolphin field, off the east coast of the Caribbean islands.
Mr Howard Dalton, managing director for exploration and production, said
'the agreement gives the go-ahead for the development of the field,' which
with probable reserves of 2,000bn cu ft is twice as big as the North
Morecambe field off the west coast of the UK.
The company declined to put a value on the contract, which will require
British Gas and Texaco, its 50/50 partner, to invest Dollars 300m (Pounds
195m). An offshore drilling and production platform will be built as well as
a 42-mile subsea pipeline. The first gas is expected to flow in mid-1996.
British Gas took over the Dolphin field when it acquired much of Tenneco
International's international oil and gas operations in 1988. It is also
part of a consortium which is assessing the prospects of exporting liquefied
natural gas from other offshore fields in the area.
The company, which is also active in Argentina and Canada, reported sharply
higher profits from international gas supply in its interim figures last
Thursday.
