<H5>  Main Events and Trends in February </H5>
  Peace initiatives in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region are succeeding in returning violence levels 
to the manageable proportions of a year ago. 
  Natal is now strongly centre-stage in the political violence 
with 66 percent of countrywide deaths in February; this is 
clearly where maximum effort needs to be concentrated. 
  Two major massacres were recorded in the Midlands sub-region 
of Natal. 
  Women and children accounted for 18 percent of all deaths in 
February. 
  Amongst February victims were 9 commuters, 20 women, 25 
children and 6 security force members; reports identified 70 ANC 
[African National Congress] supporters and 31 IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] supporters amongst the dead. 
  Detention without trial continues unbridled with Sections 29 
and Section 50 of the ISA [Internal Security Act] in constant 
use.

brought into effect.

forces.

[Human Rights Commission] Election Watch No.2 for interference

<H6>  Political Violence </H6>
<H5>  General Comment </H5>
  February recorded the seventh successive month of decline in 
political violence as measured by deathtoll. Average daily 
death toll dipped below 9 this month and seems head back to the 
level of 6 per day which was prevalent this time last year, and 
a far cry from the level of 20 per day during last July. 
<H5>  Incidents of Violence </H5>
  During February, HRC recorded 361 incidents of political 
violence, appreciably down from the 509 of January and from the 
464 average of last year. 
<H5>  Deaths and Injuries </H5>

  The February deathtoll of 245 is significantly down from the 
January figure of 328 and reconfirms the strong downward trend 
in political violence. 
  There has been a 60 percent drop since the July peak. The 
injury count for February was 302, higher than January, but 
below last year's average. 
<H5>  Major Massacres </H5>
  Two major massacres (10 or more deaths) were recorded in 
February, both of them in the Midlands sub-region of Natal: 
  On the 6th February, 12 ANC supporters were killed at 
Masunkazane (Richmond) 
  On the 18th February, 15 ANC supporters were killed at 
Mahlele (Creighton) 
Regional Analysis 
  The PWV deathtoll recorded a dramatic drop to 69 in 
February, 
compared with 142 in January and vindicated the replacement of 
the Internal Stability Unit of the SAP [South African Police] by 
units of the SA Defence Force as the primary peacekeeping force 
in the area. The PWV region seems now to be well on its way to 
being stabilised, but sub regions which are still unsettled are 
West Rand, Alexandra, Vaal and of course the East Rand which 
accounted for 62 percent of PWV deaths in February. 
  Natal is now strongly centre-stage in the political violence 
with 66 percent of the countrywide deaths in February. The 
provisional figure of 161 deaths is nevertheless a little lower 
than any figure during the last eight months. 
  Other regions accounted for 15 deaths, or 6 percent of 
national total. 
<H5>  Some Components of the Violence </H5>
  Security force actions resulted in fewer deaths in February 
(7 against 11 in January) but in the high number of 105 injuries 
due to the use of rubber bullets and birdshot during incidents 
at Standerton and Primrose gold mine. 
  Attacks on security forces declined noticeably in February, 
result in 6 deaths and 16 injuries in the course of 30 incidents. 
  Right wing activity continues to mount and was responsible 
for 2 deaths and 17 injuries in 31 incidents. 
  Taxi conflict claimed 5 lives in February. 
  A number of incidents of industrial and education conflict 
occurred, but caused no loss of life.
