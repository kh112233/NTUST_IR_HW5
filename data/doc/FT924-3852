FT  05 DEC 92 / Matrix Churchill challenge by MP
MR Ken Livingstone, Labour MP for Brent East, alleged yesterday that Iraq
was aware that staff of Matrix Churchill - a company at the heart of the
arms export controversy - were feeding information to British intelligence.
He said Iraq had arranged for disinformation to be transmitted that resulted
in the Amiriya shelter bombing of February last year.
Mr Livingstone called on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to investigate
allegations
in an affidavit submitted to Lord Justice Scott, who is investigating the
Matrix Churchill affair.
Mr Livingstone alleges that the Iraqi authorities sent women and children to
the shelter 'in the certain knowledge that the site would be targeted as a
military installation by the allies'.
He said President George Bush had been 'outraged' by the bombing because the
US distrusted British intelligence material culled from businessmen.
