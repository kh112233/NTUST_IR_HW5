FT  10 SEP 93 / Glaxo increases dividend by 29%
GLAXO, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported a 17 per
cent rise in pre-tax profits for the year to June 30, up from Pounds 1.42bn
to Pounds 1.67bn.
The results were helped by robust performances from Zantac, the world's
best-selling medicine, and recently introduced products. Advantageous
exchange rates contributed to the improvement.
The Glaxo board surprised the market with a 29 per cent dividend increase.
It proposed a final dividend of 15p, making a total of 22p (against 17p) for
the year. Glaxo's shares rose 27p to 628p.
Glaxo's cash mountain continued to grow. Liquid funds available for
investment increased from Pounds 1.332bn to Pounds 1.815bn. However, Mr John
Coombe, finance director, said that in view of the uncertain conditions in
the healthcare environment, the company was not in a hurry to spend.
Dr Richard Sykes, chief executive, said doubts remained over the future of
Zantac, sales of which rose 20 per cent to Pounds 2.172bn. At constant
exchange rates, the growth was 11 per cent. The drugs' patents are being
challenged and it faces increasing competition.
Dr Sykes said he did not expect US healthcare reforms to have a significant
impact on Glaxo's business. The company generated more than Dollars 3bn
(Pounds 1.9bn) in the US. Nearly half of that was already through the
managed care system that President Bill Clinton was hoping to encourage, Dr
Sykes said.
Expenditure on research and development increased 24 per cent to Pounds
739m, making the group the world's largest spender on drugs R&amp;D. The company
said it expected R&amp;D spending to increase to Pounds 850m in the coming year.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 650m, up 15 per cent. It had probably peaked,
Dr Sykes said.
Group turnover increased 20 per cent from Pounds 4bn to Pounds 4.9bn and
operating profits were up 18 per cent from Pounds 1.28bn to Pounds 1.525bn.
At constant exchange rates, they rose 11 per cent and 12 per cent
respectively.
Earnings per share increased 16 per cent from 34.3p to 39.9p. Earnings per
American Depositary Receipt increased 7 per cent from Dollars 1.21 to
Dollars 1.29.
