FT  18 JUL 94 / Comapany News (This Week): Superstar Tagamet will be a hard
act to follow - Smithkline Beecham/Wellcome
Two of the UK's biggest drugs groups report this week. Tomorrow, SmithKline
Beecham announces results to June 30. Analysts expect pre-tax profits for
the second quarter at between Pounds 272m and Pounds 282m (against Pounds
257m before exceptionals).
Most attention will be given to the plight of Tagamet, the anti-ulcer drug
which was formerly the group's biggest product and whose US patents expired
on May 17. Analysts will be looking for any comments about the speed of
Tagamet's decline. The progress of newer products, such as Paxil, an
anti-depressant, will also be scrutinised.
Questions will also be asked of Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive, about the
problems at the clinical laboratories businesses in the US, which have
traditionally been profitable, but have run into difficulties with the more
cost-conscious healthcare environment.
On Thursday, Wellcome reports four- month figures to June 30. The company is
changing its year end from August to December. Analysts will therefore focus
on underlying sales growth.
Last year, such growth was disappointing, including sales of Zovirax,
Wellcome's biggest product. The slowdown in Japan should have ended after
the withdrawal of a Japanese competitor, and the destocking that affected
sales in the US should have worked its way out. Expectations for Zovirax are
for a 10 per cent rise.
Analysts also expect the sales decline in Retrovir, the HIV and Aids
treatment, to start bottoming out. The effects of the Concord trial, which
questioned the drug's effectiveness in HIV-positive patients without
symptoms, should be wearing off. There should be some compensating growth
among symptomatic patients and in combination therapies with other products.
