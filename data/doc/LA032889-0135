'STAR WARS' WAS OVERSOLD, CHENEY SAYS 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that the value of the "Star Wars" 
anti-missile defense concept was oversold during the Reagan Administration but 
that the program has potential. 
At the same time, he said funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as the 
program is formally known, may have to be cut as part of Pentagon 
belt-tightening to pare the federal budget deficit. 
Former President Ronald Reagan's proposed fiscal 1990 budget called for total 
"Star Wars" spending of $5.9 billion, including $300 million for SDI research 
funded through the Energy Department. 
That would represent a 44% increase over the current fiscal year -- a request 
considered unrealistically high by many members of Congress from both parties. 
In a series of interviews with U.S. television networks, Cheney said he did not 
view SDI as having the potential to block all incoming ballistic missiles. 
"Well, I think I would argue . . . that oftentimes during the Reagan 
Administration it was described in terms that frankly I think oversold the 
concept," he said on NBC's "Today" show. 
Not 'Complete Shield' 
He added in an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America": "I don't advocate the 
view that some have in the past that it will provide a total and complete 
shield. . . . " 
Reagan launched "Star Wars" on March 23, 1983, with a call to make nuclear 
weapons "impotent and obsolete" by developing the means to destroy Soviet 
missiles before they could hit U.S. soil. 
In his second inaugural address Jan. 21, 1985, Reagan described SDI research as 
designed to develop a "security shield" that would "render nuclear weapons 
obsolete."
