FT  30 SEP 92 / Researcher on RUC programme faces charge
A TELEVISION researcher who worked on a controversial documentary that
alleged systematic collusion between members of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary and loyalist paramilitary death squads today faces a charge of
perjury.
Mr Ben Hamilton, who worked for Box Productions which made The Committee for
the Channel 4 Dispatches series, was arrested at his home in north London
yesterday.
Scotland Yard said he would appear today before Horseferry Road magistrates
on one count of perjury allegedly committed on or before July 28 this year
at the Royal Courts of Justice, in The Strand, London.
Channel 4 and Box were fined Pounds 75,000 in the summer for contempt of
court for refusing to reveal the identity of the informant who had made the
allegations against the RUC.
The Committee alleged that an organisation of 60 people plotted and carried
out 20 sectarian killings over two years.
Channel 4 said yesterday: 'Ben Hamilton's arrest at 6.30 this morning
suggests that dawn raids against journalists are back in fashion.'
