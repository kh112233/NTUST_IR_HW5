DR. NEIL SOLOMON: ANOREXIA IN TEENS 
Question: I never realized how really dangerous an eating disorder could be 
until I read about anorexia in your column. Do these dangers apply to women of 
all ages? For example, if a teen-ager has an eating problem, isn't there a 
chance that she'll outgrow it? I would imagine that anorexia in a teen-ager 
would not be as serious a condition as it would be in an older woman. 
Answer: The results of a study conducted by researchers from the University of 
Rochester (N.Y.) Medical Center tend to support your view. They report that 
most adolescent girls who develop anorexia nervosa respond to treatment with a 
return to their normal weight; fewer than 15 percent of those studied had a 
continuing problem related to their eating disorder. Moreover, neither their 
educational nor employment accomplishments were affected by the disorder.
