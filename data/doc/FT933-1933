FT  21 SEP 93 / Arafat bid to calm Jordanian fears
MR Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, flew to
Amman yesterday to discuss implications of the Gaza-Jericho accord, James
Whittington reports from Amman. Mr Arafat's visit also served as an
opportunity to calm fears that Jordan was being excluded from issues
effecting Palestinians and the region as a whole.
Despite initial reservations about being left out from the Israeli-PLO
negotiations, King Hussein has fully endorsed the Palestinian peace deal.
There has, however, been a noticeable shift in policy over the past week
from the traditional joint Jordanian-Palestinian stance to one where the
kingdom's interests take priority.
Two issues expected to be discussed with Mr Arafat were Jordan's economic
relationship with the West Bank, and the future status of the kingdom's
Palestinians who make up over half the population.
The government says it may have to postpone this year's multi-party
elections until the status of Palestinians living in the kingdom is
clarified. The elections, scheduled for November 8, were to be the first
since 1956 in which political parties would campaign.
However, there are fears that the elections may become a referendum on the
peace process with Islamist and leftist parties winning votes from those
Palestinians who have nothing to gain from the settlement.
Western diplomats express severe reservations about any postponement. 'The
damage to democracy would be considerable,' said one. 'Palestinians in
Jordan will feel targeted which could prove destabilising,' said another.
Jordan's nationalist parties and tribal leaders are especially vocal in
their calls for postponing the elections. Head of the nationalist party Al
Ahd, Mr Hadi Abdul Majali, who is also the prime minister's brother, argues
that either Palestinians who will be allowed to return should relinquish
their voting rights or the elections should be postponed.
