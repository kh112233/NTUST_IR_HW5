FT  14 SEP 92 / Estonia and Latvia close to IMF deals
THE International Monetary Fund is expected to approve standby agreements
this week for Latvia and Estonia, enabling the two Baltic republics to
borrow up to Dollars 120m (Pounds 60.9m) between them from the Fund.
Estonia and Latvia will be the first republics of the former Soviet Union to
conclude fully fledged IMF standby agreements  - which provide money to help
a country meet its balance of payments shortfalls in return for agreement on
an economic recovery programme. Russia has negotiated a preliminary
agreement allowing it to draw on a first credit tranche of Dollars 1bn.
Senior IMF officials said the fund was in the process of finalising a
similar standby agreement with Lithuania. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are
expected to complete arrangements soon.
Belarus is also making progress in negotiations with the IMF and officials
said they were holding discussions with Ukraine.
The Baltic states' standby agreements are expected to allow them to draw up
to 90 per cent of their IMF quotas. This would give Latvia access to around
Dollars 81m, Estonia to about Dollars 41m and Lithuania to around Dollars
91m.
IMF funding will form part of a broader package of external financial
assistance involving substantial aid from the Nordic countries and the
European Community.
In its annual report, published last week, the IMF commended Estonia for its
progress towards a market economy, but expressed some concern about the
slowing of economic reform in Latvia.
IMF officials said they particularly appreciated the 'civilised fashion' in
which the two countries had left the rouble zone, setting up their own
currencies  - the kroon in Estonia and the lat in Latvia.
