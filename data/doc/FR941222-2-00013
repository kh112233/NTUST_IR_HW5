Notice of Government Owned Inventions Available for Licensing.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The inventions listed below are owned by the U.S. Government, as represented by the Department of Commerce, and are
available for licensing in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 and 37 CFR Part 404 to achieve expeditious commercialization
of results of federally funded research and development.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:


Technical and licensing information on these inventions may be obtained by writing to: Marcia Salkeld, National
Institute of Standards and Technology, Office of Technology Commercialization, Physics Building, Room B256,
Gaithersburg, MD 20899; Fax 3018692751. Any request for information should include the NIST Docket
No. and Title for the relevant invention as indicated below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The inventions available for licensing are:


NIST Docket No. 91020CIP2


Title: Electric Test Structure and Method for Measuring the Relative Locations of Conducting Features on an Insulating
Substrate
Description: NIST researchers have invented a new electrical test structure to provide measurements of the separations
of conducting features on an insulating substrate with uncertainties typically below 10 nm. Measurement dynamic
repeatability is nominally less than 1 nm. Absolute accuracy has been determined by comparing measurements of the
same feature separations with those made by the NIST line-scale interferometer which has traceability to absolute
length standards.


NIST Docket No. 92017


Title: Electroforming of Metallic Glasses for Dental Applications
Description: A method of electroforming metallic glasses to produce dental prostheses and the resulting prostheses.
The method uses a cobalt-phosphorus metallic glass alloy that produces prostheses with superior strength and high
corrosion resistance.


NIST Docket No. 93040


Title: Underwater Work Platform Support System
Description: NIST researchers have developed a system to stabilize an underwater work platform in six degrees of
freedom. Suspended by cables beneath a surface vessel, the platform is stabilized through the use of winches and motion
sensors even when the surface vessel is disturbed by waves.


NIST Docket No. 93057


Title: Prevention of Contact Tube Melting In Arc Welding
Description: NIST engineers have developed a technique to detect and prevent the onset of contact tube melting in
gas metal arc and flux cored arc welding. Anticipating the problem enables interruption of the welding power supply
and prevention of contact tube melting.


NIST Docket No. 93012


Title: Accumulator Distillation Insert for Zeotropic Refrigerant Mixtures
Description: NIST researchers have developed an accumulator distillation insert that improves the efficiency
of heat pumps. The insert is cost-effective because it only requires minor modifications to an existing system, it
does not change the basic refrigeration cycle, and it adds no additional moving parts or valves.
