  [Text] Russian Foreign Ministry has no information 
concerning facts of mistreatment with respect to Russian 
diplomats in Pyongyang on the part of the authorities of the 
Korean People's Democratic Republic. A high-ranking Russian 
diplomat made these comments in his interview with Interfax 
regarding the rumors about attacks against employees of the 
Russian Embassy in Pyongyang due to the recent arrest of three 
North-Korean diplomats in Moscow. 
  According to the Federal Counterintelligence Service 
Director 
Sergey Stepashin, the diplomats were caught red-handed trying to 
buy advanced Russian technologies. 
  Interfax interlocutor underlined that Moscow would 
demonstrate adequate reaction in case of "unfriendly actions" 
with respect to Russian diplomats in the DPRK. 
  At the same time he believes that first of all it is 
necessary to investigate the incident with the employees of the 
Korean Embassy. "Given the fact that a tense situation has 
established on the Korean peninsular and Russia is participating 
in its settlement, nobody needs any espionage scandal," said the 
Russian diplomat.
