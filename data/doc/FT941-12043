FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc unit misses target
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals division of Rhone-Poulenc, the
French chemicals group, yesterday announced net profits of Dollars 408.7m
for last year, a fall of about 5 per cent compared with the Dollars 428.2m
reported in 1992.
Mr Robert Cawthorn, chairman and chief executive, said the results were
'below what we had planned'.
He said the environment facing the industry had been more difficult than
expected, particularly in Germany and Italy, where pharmaceuticals companies
have been hit by government healthcare reforms and reduced prices.
Sales held fairly constant at Dollars 4.02bn, while earnings per share
slipped to Dollars 2.96 from Dollars 3.10.
Excluding exceptional items, earnings per share rose slightly to Dollars
2.92 from Dollars 2.82.
In spite of the fall in profits and earnings per share, Mr Cawthorn cited
several encouraging factors.
He said sales growth in Japan, the US and France, the world's three largest
pharmaceuticals markets, exceeded the market average. In the US, sales of
both prescription and over-the-counter drugs posted double digit gains.
The company is developing products, such as Zagam, an antibiotic and
Taxotere, an anti-cancer agent which was described as the company's number
one research priority.
RPR said it was planning to file Taxotere for registration in North America,
Japan and Europe in the third quarter of this year.
In the longer term, RPR said it was investing in new technologies,
particularly in cell and gene therapy.
Mr Cawthorn said 1994 was a transitional year, which would see increased
investment in new products and an increase in its cost-cutting efforts.
