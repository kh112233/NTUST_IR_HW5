  [Text] The Amazonas State Federal Police [PF] believe that 
the illegal trade in fish between Brazil and Colombia is 
concealing the international cocaine trafficking activities of 
the Leticia cartel. 
  According to Police Inspector Mauro Sposito, superintendent 
of the Amazonas State PF, the traffickers use fish to smuggle 
the drugs. 
  Sposito said that it has been learned that cocaine 
trafficking from Colombia to the United States is controlled by 
two Colombian brothers known as Evaristo and Henri. They own 
two fish packing plants that are used in the laundering of drug 
trafficking money. 
  A supervisor at the Brazilian Institute for the Environment 
and Renewable Natural Resources, who did not want to identify 
himself, suspects that the Colombian boats that come to Brazil 
to fetch fish are loaded with cocaine.
