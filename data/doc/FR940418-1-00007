Administration, Manager, System Management Branch (ASO530), Air Traffic Division, P.O. Box 20636, Atlanta,
Georgia 30320. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on

The Proposal



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Offshore
Airspace Area at San Juan, PR. The intended effect is to lower the base of the Offshore Airspace Area from 5500 feet MSL
to 2500 feet MSL, to contain IFR operations in controlled airspace, and to create a uniform base of controlled airspace
in the area. The base of this controlled airspace was increased to 5500 feet during the airspace reclassification
for the purpose of creating a standard 5500 ft. base of controlled airspace in all the surrounding areas, however,
the base of all airspace surrounding the San Juan Offshore Airspace was never increased to 5500 ft. and remains at 2500
feet MSL. It has also been found with the base at 5500 feet, air traffic control does not have sufficient airspace for
IFR traffic arriving and departing Rafael Hernandez Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based
on North American Datum 83. Designations for Offshore Airspace Areas are published in Paragraph 6007 of FAA Order
7400.9A dated June 17, 1993 and effective September 16, 1993 which is incorporated by reference in CFR 71.1. The Offshore
Airspace Area designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
