METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOG SHOT IN STANDOFF EXPECTED TO RECOVER 
A bullet remained lodged in Asko the Long Beach police dog's jawbone Thursday, 
a day after he was shot in the snout during a standoff between police and a 
barricaded woman, officers said. 
Asko, a 4-year-old, male German shepherd who has worked for the Long Beach 
Police Department for the last two years, was wounded during the 11-hour 
stalemate that ended with the shooting early Wednesday, police said. 
Asko lost 1 1/2 pints of blood and two upper molars, said Long Beach Police 
Sgt. Chuck Higley, the department's canine handler. 
He said Asko was in stable condition and was expected to recover fully even 
though the "bullet, when it shattered, lodged on the inner part of his 
jawbone." 
The woman involved in the shoot-out, identified as Kari Lynne Kantonwine, was 
treated at County-USC Medical Center for a broken arm and booked for 
investigation of shooting a police dog and four other counts, said Police Lt. 
Stephen Bonswor.
