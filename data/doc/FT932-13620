FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Nucor plans to expand capacity
NUCOR, the leading US steel mini-mill group, is to greatly expand capacity
at a plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana, which has shaken up the industry by
its use of a radical, new technology.
The company is to expand the plant's annual capacity from 1m tons a year to
1.8m tons.
The expansion would cost less than Dollars 40m, would increase the number of
employees by only 10 per cent, and would be in operation by the second
quarter of 1994.
The company pioneered the thin-slab casting method of making sheet steel at
the Crawfordsville plant, which began operations in 1989.
This makes sheet steel much more cheaply than conventional methods, since it
cuts out several stages of the manufacturing process.
Last year Nucor opened a second thin-slab plant in Hickman, Arkansas, with
an annual capacity of over 1m tons.
Until Crawfordsville began operations, the high-value sheet market had been
one of the few sectors of the US steel market in which the country's
traditional, integrated manufacturers had been free from competition from
low-cost mini-mills.
However, its lead is being followed by other mini-mill groups and the
integrated manufacturers themselves.
