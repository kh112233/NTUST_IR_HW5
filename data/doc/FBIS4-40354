  [Text] Tallinn, June 15, BNS -- The Estonian Cabinet 
yesterday ruled that the country will not render flight control 
operations in its upper air space to any foreign country, Prime 
Minister Mart Laar said in a press conference. 
  The Finnish Aviation Department early last month delivered 
to 
its Estonian counterpart body its proposals concerning a 
possible takeover of the control by Finnish operators in 
Tampere. The plan was considered because of reports that the 
technical equipment used by fight controllers in Estonia is 
several decades behind the present-day level. 
  The Cabinet today decided that there were no serious 
political or economic grounds to hand over the control and that 
the step would contradict Estonia's responsibilities under 
international agreements. Laar said Estonia will start 
preparation of a long-term program aimed at purchasing 
state-of-the-art equipment for flight control. 
  Operations by commercial airlines in several international 
air corridors crossing Estonia in the upper air space, or higher 
than 6,000 meters above the ground, brought to Estonia some 30 
million kroons in fees last year. 
  "We have been able to ensure flight security so far also in 
the upper air space -- the question is on what level," Jaan 
Tamm, deputy head of the Estonian Aviation Department, told BNS. 
According to estimates by the International Civil Aviation 
Organization (ICAO), Estonia needs 39 million dollars, or some 
530 million kroons, to update its flight control systems and 
train the personnel.
