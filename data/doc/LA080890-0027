ASIAN IMMIGRANTS IN PACIFIC RIM 
According to Gibson's article there are many Chinese moving businesses from 
Hong Kong to the United States, Canada and Australia. Most are immigrating to 
these countries along with their companies. 
A few stay in Hong Kong to live. 
Michael Hsiao says in the article: "Double bookkeeping is universal," and that 
the basic idea is to avoid taxes." But he also added an ancient saying. "If you 
have wealth it is best to keep it a secret." 
According to Lee A. Iacocca a way to increase our revenue is to tap foreign 
companies who do hundreds of billions of dollars worth of business every year 
but pay virtually no income tax. He suggested a business transfer tax which is 
a value added tax. 
A 7% business transfer tax could mean a net increase of $42 billion a year for 
Washington, with no tax increase for Americans or American business.
