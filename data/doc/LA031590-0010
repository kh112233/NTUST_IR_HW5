YOUR COINS: NOT ALL UNCIRCULATED PROOF SETS RISE IN VALUE 
Question: Will you kindly let me know the value of uncirculated proof sets of 
1978, '79, '80 and '81. Also the value of the 1975 Bicentennial medal 
commemorating the battles of Lexington and Concord; plus the Paul Revere gold 
American Revolution Bicentennial coin, 1776-1976; and the U.S. Bicentennial 
silver proof set. -- T.G.W. 
Answer: Proof sets and uncirculated sets are popular ways of collecting U.S 
coinage. I suspect your reference to "uncirculated" proof sets actually means 
proof sets that have not been circulated. Since the middle 1950s, these sets 
have been produced in large quantities, which attests to their popularity. 
As a result, they are, by and large, not investment-quality coins, at least not 
at this point. Still, many people want complete dates of these sets, so they 
continue to buy the new issues and occasionally fill in the earlier dates, 
which go back to 1936 and can be quite expensive. 
Your 1978 and 1979 proof sets were issued at $9 each. The '78 is currently 
worth about $6.75 and the '79 is about $5.25. The 1980 proof set originally 
cost $10; it's now worth about $5.25. The '81 originally cost $11 and it's now 
worth about $8.75. 
These are sets to own and enjoy. You can appreciate their beauty and, quite 
possibly, eventually realize a profit if you can bear to part with them. If 
you're interested in investment-quality coins, you'll have to seek earlier 
dates and lower mintages, as a rule. 
Your Bicentennial medal is worth about $8; the Paul Revere gold and the 
Bicentennial silver proof set are primarily worth their bullion content. 
Q: Please let me know if this is worth anything (enclosed is a copy of a 5-cent 
Military Payment Certificate). -- G.B. 
A: The market for such wartime currency is virtually nil. Your MPC, as it is 
known, has little or no collector value. 
Q: As an older citizen of Encino, I would like information on finding a 
reputable coin firm in the San Fernando Valley where I live. I would like to 
sell my small coin collection, mostly U.S. silver and gold coins, dated in the 
19th Century. The Yellow Pages list many dealers; the problem is to find one 
well-recommended. -- E.K. 
A: As a matter of policy, I do not recommend dealers. The reason is, dealers 
work on different profit margins, dealers have different needs and different 
customers to satisfy, and dealers disagree among themselves as to what a coin 
is worth. 
My suggestion is to list your coins, contact dealers and see what they will 
offer. Most dealers will want to see your coins before giving you a quote. It 
will take a little work, but eventually you'll be able to determine the best 
price in today's market. If in doubt, don't sell. Have prices quoted for the 
entire lot and also for individual coins. 
Q: I am seeking information on a commemorative medal that is shaped like a 
coin. The item is platinum, weighs about .75 ounces, is round and came in a 
leather-covered gift box. The medal commemorates Expo '70 Japan World 
Exposition, Osaka, Japan, 1970. I would be interested in knowing its value and 
whether there is a market for this medal. Is there a magazine or source for 
people who collect this type of item? And how might I reach them? -- S.M.P. 
A: Essentially, what you have is a bullion piece that is worth about 90% of the 
spot price of platinum. However, if you can locate a token collector, 
specifically one who is interested in world's fairs and expos, you might do 
better. Seek them out at coin shows or contact the California Assn. of Token 
Collectors, which meets the third Monday of the month at 8 p.m. at Mercury 
Savings &amp; Loan, 2920 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West Los Angeles. Mailing address: 
Box 943, Santa Monica, Calif. 90406.
