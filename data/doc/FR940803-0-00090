<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Coast Guard is amending the rule that requires notice of marine casualties. The amended rule will clarify which
marine casualties require immediate notice, the means of giving other notice, who shall give it, and to whom it shall
be given, so that prompt corrective or investigative efforts can be initiated. The intent of this change is to provide
a mechanism that will help prevent another disaster such as the derailment of a passenger train near Mobile, Alabama,
in September, 1993.

This rule is effective on August 3, 1994. Comments must be received on or before November 1, 1994.

Office of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection, and Patrick J. Murray, Project Counsel, Office
of Chief Counsel.



Regulatory Information



This rule is being published as an interim rule and is being made effective on the date of publication. The Coast Guard
has determined that it would be contrary to the public interest to delay publication of this amendment, which clarifies
existing law, imposes no new regulatory requirement, and accomplishes no significant change in policy. For these
good reasons, the Coast Guard finds, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3) and (d)(3), that both notice and public hearing on the
notice, before the effective date of this rule, are unnecessary and that this rule should be made effective less than
30 days after publication.



Background and Purpose



(a) The derailment of the Amtrak Sunset Limited, a passenger train, on September 22, 1993, with extensive injury and
loss of life, resulted in a study by the Coast Guard entitled 

Review of Marine Safety Issues Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels.

 This study, conducted jointly by the Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services (GN) and the Office
of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection (GM), provided the Commandant with a number of recommendations
to enhance safety in the towing industry. (Persons may review this study at the office of the Marine Safety Council
at the address under ``ADDRESSES.'') One of these recommendations called for a regulatory project to improve procedures
whereby information concerning allisions is reported. The Commandant concurred, and directed the Marine Investigation
Division (GMMI), within GM, to initiate the project. On March 2, 1994, the Coast Guard announced [59
FR 10031] a public meeting to help guide the project.

(b) The preliminary findings on the allision in September, 1993, of a tow with a railroad bridge near Mobile, Alabama
(the AMTRAK accident), indicated that there is substantial potential for misunderstanding which incidents require
immediate notice, the means of giving other notice, by whom, and to whom. Rulemaking is necessary to improve the giving
of notice on allisions.
