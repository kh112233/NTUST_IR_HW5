FT  27 JAN 93 / Czech and Slovak polls marred
A BOMB threat, a walk-out of MPs and an inconclusive vote marred the
election of presidents in the new Czech and Slovak republics yesterday,
writes Patrick Blum in Prague.
In Prague a bomb threat caused parliament to be evacuated as Czech deputies
were about to vote. Later Czech television said former Czechoslovak
president Vaclav Havel had won with at least 109 votes in the 200-seat
assembly.
Earlier, deputies staged a walk-out after an attack on Mr Havel by
right-wing opponents who accused him of responsibility for a crime wave
following his amnesty of prisoners during his 1990-92 presidency.
Meanwhile in Bratislava, none of the candidates for the Slovak presidency
won enough parliamentary votes to be elected. Deputies are to vote again
today after what are likely to be hectic talks between parties to try to put
together the necessary 90 votes needed for a candidate's election in the
150-seat Slovak assembly.
The inconclusive first round is a setback for Mr Vladimir Meciar, prime
minister and leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), who
had strongly backed Mr Roman Kovac, a former member of the Slovak Communist
party and current deputy prime minister, for the job.
Mr Kovac received the support of only 69 of the HZDS's 74 deputies.
