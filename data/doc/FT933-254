FT  30 SEP 93 / Bentsen urges boost for jobs
MR Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, yesterday called on the world's
industrial nations to remove barriers to employment.
Addressing the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank, he said the fight to reduce unemployment in the industrial world from
its current level of 35m required more than action to stimulate demand.
'Policies that spur demand will urge companies to take on workers and
increase production,' Mr Bentsen said. 'At the same time, we must eliminate
the structural barriers employers face - the ones that convince them in a
thousand little ways that hiring the extra employee is just not worth the
trouble.'
Mr Bentsen said that the Group of Seven industrial nations' jobs conference,
which the Clinton administration plans to host in Washington this autumn,
would consider both demand-boosting policies and action to cut structural
unemployment. 'We must learn from each other's experience and find ways to
restore our ability to produce jobs,' he said.
There was a 'very real risk' of arriving at next year's IMF and World Bank
annual meetings 'with nothing more to say than recovery is still right
around the corner,' Mr Bentsen said. 'After three years, this line is
beginning to wear a little thin.'.
He said he believed the big industrial countries were finding the political
will to implement growth policies. The past week's discussions in the G7 and
IMF's policy-making Interim Committee had been enouraging. 'I believe we are
all moving together.'
Mr Bentsen made yet another plea for a conclusion of the Uruguay Round of
trade liberalisation talks this year. 'Time is running out,' he said. The
December 15 deadline for completing the round with the benefit of fast track
procedures in the US Congress was 'close at hand'.
Mr Bentsen warned against hopes the deadline might be flexible. 'I would not
expect the US Congress to approve an extension of it.'
