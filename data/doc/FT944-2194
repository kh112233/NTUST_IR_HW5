FT  17 DEC 94 / Eurotunnel sets fares for car services
Fares for car drivers in the Channel tunnel will be Pounds 49 for a day
return when Le Shuttle services start on Thursday.
Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator, said yesterday that a five-day return for a
car with driver and passengers would cost Pounds 75. A standard return,
required on longer trips, would cost Pounds 136.
Eurotunnel's one-day returns are lower than the brochure prices quoted by
its ferry rivals but much higher than the special fares on offer. P&amp;O
European Ferries and Stena Sealink list a weekday price of Pounds 72 return
between Dover and Calais in their brochures but have a special offer for
December of just Pounds 20.
Stena Sealink said Eurotunnel had promised that it would be charging a
premium price for a good quality service, but these prices indicated that it
was launching a price war with an inferior product.
Mr Christopher Garnett, Eurotunnel's commercial director, said: 'Our fares
are highly competitive. While we will not enter a price war we are confident
that we will attract customers to our fast, hassle-free system.' P&amp;O said
Eurotunnel would be starting with very limited capacity and would have
little effect on its ferries.
Le Shuttle's standard return and five-day return fares in December are lower
than the ferry fares. Between January and March the ferry fares will fall
sharply, however, and will be almost the same as those of Eurotunnel.
More than 1,000 people bought the one-day return tickets in the first hour
when over-the-counter and telesales started yesterday. Customers will be
required to book their tickets in advance until the end of March, when
Eurotunnel will switch to a turn-up-and-go service.
The shuttle journey takes 35 minutes from the Folkestone terminal to the
Calais terminal, although the total time including check-in and loading is
about an hour. Passengers drive their cars on to the double-deck shuttle
carriages and remain in or near their vehicles.
The launch of the passenger shuttles, 18 months behind schedule and seven
months after the official inauguration of the tunnel, completes the range of
tunnel services.
Freight shuttles started in May, through freight services followed in June
and the Eurostar trains, for passengers only between London, Paris and
Brussels, started in November. The shuttle will initially provide an hourly
service between 8am and 8pm seven days a week. It will move to 24-hour
operation and increase the frequency of departures in January.
