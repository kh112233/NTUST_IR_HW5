FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Biotechnology, jute and oil in a jam jar
An oil slick in a jam jar was yesterday used to demonstrate plans by
Titaghur, the owner of six jute mills in Calcutta, to move into
biotechnology.
The crowded annual meeting approved the delayed accounts showing that
Titaghur had incurred a loss on ordinary activities of Pounds 4.3m on
turnover of Pounds 29m in the year to end-March 1993, taking the accumulated
deficit to Pounds 61m.
Mr Reg Brealey, chairman, attributed the latest loss to inconsistent
supplies of raw jute. He apologised to shareholders at London's Charing
Cross Hotel for the delay in presenting the accounts, blaming problems in
Calcutta. Accounting there was not computerised, but was all done by hand,
he explained.
Since last March the group has made two acquisitions - West Midlands
Surfacing, a road maintenance company, and Knoydart Peninsula, a Scottish
estate to be used for youth training.
Mr Joseph Lowe, head of the new Titaghur Environmental offshoot, said the
group was planning two areas of development in biotechnology.
The first involves organic material that soaks up oil but rejects water. It
will be put into jute bags and held in place over oil and other spillages by
jute booms. The absorbed pollutant can then be disposed of safely.
The second involves the commercial production of spirulina platensis, a
blue-green algae which has existed for 3 1/2 bn years and contains three
times the protein in soya.
The algae, which in its dried form smells like seaweed and sells at Pounds
186 a kilo, can be grown in open ponds, but Titaghur claims to be the first
company to produce it in a closed circuit system, guaranteeing purity.
