PROTECT EYES FROM LIGHT 
Question: I've read about the dangers of artificial tanning, especially how it 
could affect the eyes. Would this be a problem if the person closed his eyes or 
used sunglasses? 
Answer: Closing the eyes or using regular sunglasses is not sufficient 
protection when you expose yourself to light from artificial tanning equipment. 
If you insist on using such equipment despite the risks involved, you should 
wear special protective glasses.
