SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 721(d)(1) (21 U.S.C. 379e(d)(1))), notice is given that a color
additive petition (CAP 4C0243) has been filed by Gist-brocades NV, Wateringseweg, 2611 XT Delft, The Netherlands.
The petition proposes that part 73 (21 CFR part 73) of the color additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe
use of the inactivated and dried yeast 

Phaffia rhodozyma

 to provide a pigment source for salmonids. 


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before November
16, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number

environmental assessment without further announcement in the 

Federal Register

. If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition
results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
