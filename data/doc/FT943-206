FT  30 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Contraception the natural way
A natural method of contraception, which depends on monitoring hormone
levels, has been developed by Unipath, a diagnostic kit manufacturer.
The kit uses a urine test to track the level of luteinising hormone and
estrone-3-glucuronide. It is used with a hand-held monitor, which calculates
a woman's fertile period using information about her menstrual cycle.
Early trials indicate 98 per cent effectiveness, which is roughly equivalent
to barrier methods of contraception. The product is expected to be launched
at the end of next year.
