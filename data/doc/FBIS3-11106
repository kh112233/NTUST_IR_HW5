<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella by LA NACION </F>
correspondent Graciela Iglesias in Paris -- date not given] 
  [Text] [Iglesias] What commitments are involved in OECD 
membership? Are there any fees to be paid? 
  [Di Tella] Yes. A yearly fee will have to be paid. The 
amount still must be established, but it will be established on 
the basis of a small percentage of our gross domestic income. 
Being an OECD member represents ample benefits, especially 
because the membership represents a "certificate of quality" for 
our country -- not only in the economic field but also in other 
significant fields for the OECD like human rights, respect for 
democracy, and political stability. I am convinced that this is 
so to the extent that as soon as we become full-fledged OECD 
members, the international banks' interest rate for Argentina 
will be reduced. 
  [Iglesias] Beyond the Chiapas events, Mexico is another 
Latin American country that soon will become an OECD member. 
Mexico, however, is not a Development Center member. Why is 
Argentina following that strategy? 
  [Di Tella] It will enter at the end of the year. I do not 
harbor any doubts. And this makes our acceptance unavoidable. 
Mexico used a different path because it had specific U.S. 
support stemming from the NAFTA issue. 
  [Iglesias] And who supports Argentina? 
  [Di Tella] Our actions. 
  [Iglesias] Nevertheless, it is known that the Japanese 
delegation opposed Argentina's entry at the OECD council. 
  [Di Tella] It was not the Japanese position alone. The OECD 
was reluctant to increase the number of its members. It does 
not want to go from 24 to 40 members. Their requirements 
involve domestic policy (respect for human rights, democracy), 
foreign policy (cooperation), and market economy. Not all the 
developing countries have these conditions. We now are able to 
portray a consistent model in this regard. Our international 
policy is one of cooperation. We do not view conflict as a 
basis for our relations. We have good relations with Chile, 
Brazil, the United States, and the United Kingdom in everything 
except one issue. 
  [Iglesias] Concerning this issue, you have told LA NACION 
that your British counterpart gave you satisfactory explanations 
on the shipment of a Harrier plane to Chile, his visit to the 
Malvinas Islands on 2 April, and [Margaret] Thatcher's visit to 
Santiago. What were these explanations? 
  [Di Tella] Among other things, Douglas Hurd told me on 3 
March that this Harrier plane was not used during the 1982 
conflict. Nevertheless, he especially emphasized that 
Chilean-Argentine harmony is essential because his country wants 
to invest in our region. I am not concerned by his visit to the 
Malvinas Islands. In five years, he never went there. In a 
certain way, it represents a reaction to our policy of constant 
actions that forces him to overcome his inertia. And I am 
already aware of the fact that there will be ultranationalists 
who now will accuse me of "overemphasizing the Malvinas issue" 
after they used to say that I "underemphasized the Malvinas 
issue."
