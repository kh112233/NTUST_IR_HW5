<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to 
amend its public information regulations to help ensure that the 
identities of those who report adverse events associated with 
human drugs, biologics, and medical devices, and the identities 
of patients are held in confidence and not disclosed by FDA, as 
provided in current agency rules, or by manufacturers that 
possess these reports. The proposed rule is intended to preempt 
the establishment or continuation in effect of any State or local 
law, rule, regulation, or other requirement that requires or 
permits disclosure of such identities. This action is being 
taken to maintain the agency's ability to collect information 
about safety risks of FDA-regulated products that is vital to 
protection of the public health.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


A. Introduction 


A critical public health activity of FDA is to monitor the 
safety of human drugs, biologics, and devices in the marketplace. 
As part of postmarketing surveillance programs to monitor the 
safety of these products, FDA relies heavily on its adverse event 
reporting systems. These reporting systems are important 
adjuncts to the product approval process, which is based 
primarily on testing conducted before a product is marketed. 
Although preapproval testing provides significant information 
about the safety and efficacy of a product, not all potential 
safety problems can be identified in the preapproval stage when 
the number of subjects exposed to the product and the period of 
exposure are necessarily limited. For that reason, the receipt 
of postmarket reports of adverse events associated with a 
regulated product is critical to the agency's ability to help 
protect the public health.
