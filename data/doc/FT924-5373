FT  27 NOV 92 / Firebomb deaths: suspect is questioned
GERMANY'S chief federal prosecutor said yesterday a 25-year-old man had been
arrested and would be questioned about the arson attack which killed a
Turkish woman and two girls last Monday, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
The man, named as Michael Peters, was arrested in the town of Gudow, 10km
from Molln where the deaths took place, between Hamburg and Lubeck.
He is accused of founding a terrorist group, and of having taken part in two
previous attacks with Molotov cocktails against houses occupied by
asylum-seekers, and of having thrown petrol bombs at a police guarding a
home.
Mr Alexander von Stahl, the prosecutor, said the investigation of Mr Peters
and 10 other members of his group would focus on possible involvement in the
Molln attack.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, is expected to ban at least one
neo-Nazi organisation tomorrow.
