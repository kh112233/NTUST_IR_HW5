FT  13 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Maternity rules threatened
EMPLOYERS could find themselves having to provide maternity leave for
workers who have completed less than two years' service following the
decision of Sheffield industrial tribunal yesterday.
Only women who have worked for two years or more for the same employer are
entitled by law to have their jobs back after maternity leave. The tribunal
ruled, however, that a woman who fell four weeks short of the qualifying
period had, under a different law, been the victim of sex discrimination
when her employer refused to allow her to return.
The tribunal decision is in line with a European Court ruling on the issue.
According to the Equal Opportunities Commission the tribunal itself does not
set a legal precedent and the law on maternity leave remains confused.
Ms Christine Tindale had worked as a securities clerk at Barnsley Building
Society for just less than two years when she became pregnant. She requested
16 weeks' unpaid leave and her job back after having her baby. The society
refused, saying she had to work for two years before being entitled to
return.
The tribunal accepted that if Ms Tindale had applied for time off for any
other reason her employers would probably have agreed.
This would have been in line with her contract, which allowed unpaid leave.
The tribunal therefore ruled that Ms Tindale was treated unfairly because of
her pregnancy, amounting to sex discrimination under the Sex Discrimination
Act.
The tribunal had no power to order Ms Tindale's reinstatement but it awarded
her more than Pounds 6,000 in compensation.
