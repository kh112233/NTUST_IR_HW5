FT  10 OCT 92 / Brandt left indelible mark on post-war Europe: The life and
achievements of the former West German chancellor who has died at the age of
78
WILLY BRANDT, the former West German chancellor who died on Thursday aged
78, belonged to that select band of post-war European leaders who stamped an
indelible mark not just on their countries, but across the European
continent.
His chancellorship, from 1969 to 1974, was relatively short. But his period
of uninterrupted influence on the centre stage of international politics was
longer than that of any other contemporary politician, in Germany or abroad.
In an almost kaleidoscopic variety of roles, ranging from charismatic young
mayor of Berlin to his latter years as elder statesman, Brandt gave shape
and direction to German politics during four post-war decades. In his last
years, before he was stricken by cancer in the spring, Brandt took up a new
part as an emotional force behind German unification.
The turbulence of his long life mirrored Germany's own vicissitudes. Brandt
was a man of varied hues and changing moods. His capacity for misjudgment
could sometimes be almost as striking as his qualities as an activist and
visionary.
Yet beyond all the restlessness which drove him on and the controversy which
dogged him, Brandt stood out as Germany's paramount statesman of peace.
After the horror and the shame of the second world war, he was the first
chancellor to allow foreigners - and his own compatriots - to believe again
in a decent Germany playing its part in the international community.
Brandt's career, moulded beneath the shadows of the Third Reich and maturing
during the cold war, was dedicated to ensuring that his country would never
again be a source of instability and evil. Through his Ostpolitik in the
early 1970s, normalising West Germany's relations with its neighbours in the
east, Brandt did more than any other politician before Mikhail Gorbachev to
bridge the post-1945 division of the continent.
His policies on eastern Europe were hotly contested at the time by the
German right as a sell-out to communism. But Brandt was a prime architect of
the detente which eventually, in 1990, made German unification possible.
In the 1970s and 1980s he occupied himself increasingly with international
affairs, as chairman of the International Socialists and of the Brandt
Commission. It was a source of frustration that the commission, despite all
its good intentions, failed to make any headway in closing the north-south
economic gap.
The sweeping aside of communism in East Germany in the autumn and winter of
1989 gave Brandt a pivotal new domestic role in a nation being reforged
before the eyes of an astonished world. At an age when many lesser men would
have settled into their armchairs, Brandt was out on the stump in both parts
of Germany, still fighting elections for his Social Democratic party (SPD),
still drawing the crowds with his peculiar brand of rasping oratory and his
message that the Fatherland was now 'growing together' again.
Brandt's political pinnacle came much earlier, during his five years as
chancellor - a period marking the return of the SPD as the main party in
government for the first time since the Weimar Republic of 1919-33.
His chancellorship ended abruptly, with his resignation over a spy affair -
still one of Germany's most opaque post-war political crises. He remained
SPD chairman until 1987, and was the party's honorary chairman until his
death.
Brandt showed a singular ability both to stir (his power to attract younger
women had a legendary, if not notorious, quality) and to disappoint. His
setbacks were almost as striking as his triumphs, and for all his undoubted
thoughtfulness he could teeter alarmingly between hesitancy and rashness. In
many ways he was the Hamlet of German politics.
Partly because he was so often going against the tide of contemporary ideas,
Brandt was an uncomfortable, often enigmatic figure. Respected rather than
loved by the Social Democratic party, he was not the first German leader to
owe part of his authority to his aloofness. Manoeuvring his way through
pitfalls along his political path, Brandt was all too often reminded that he
remained ultimately an outsider.
The central component of Brandt's Ostpolitik was recognition of East Germany
as a separate state. Although he clung to the nebulous goal of 'unity of the
nation' (a term he distinguished from 'reunification', which he rejected
because of its revanchiste overtones), he cajoled his countrymen to come to
terms with the legacy of Hitler. By accepting the status quo of division,
Brandt laid an important part of the groundwork for eventually ending it.
When the German black, red and gold flag was hoisted in Berlin in the
midnight Unity Day ceremony on October 3 1990, the 76-year-old Brandt was
there with the other dignatories on the balcony of the Reichstag, staring
out at the huge crowds with the inscrutability which, with age, he came to
wear like a mask.
In accepting the Nobel peace prize, awarded in 1971 for his Ostpolitik
breakthrough, he said: 'I believe in diversity, and hence in doubt.' So it
was an entirely typical paradox that unity took place after Brandt had given
up any idea of seeing it happen. 'Who would want to believe that, one day,
the German Democratic Republic would be annexed to the Federal Republic, and
that would be that?' he wrote in his memoirs, published in 1989.
The elliptical question was a favourite form of statement for a man who
could not take refuge in certainties.
His scepticism, like his self-doubt, had its origin in the complexities of
his childhood. He was born as Herbert Ernst Frahm on December 18 1913 in the
northern city of Lubeck, the illegitimate son of a 19-year-old shopgirl. He
never knew his father - a loss which helped shape his non-conformism and
concern for the under-privileged, as well as a sporadic lack of discipline.
He grew up under the guardianship of his 'grandfather' (a man who, in a
further twist, turned out not to have been the father of his mother). He
joined the SPD at the age of 16. Disenchanted with the Weimar Republic, and
supporting a more active struggle against the far right, he quit a year
later, in 1931, to join a splinter group, the Socialist Workers party.
This early defiance provides a key to his later tolerance, as party
chairman, of the radicalism of the Young Socialists during the 1970s, and
his attempted espousal of the cause of the Greens ecology party during the
1980s. Of the younger generation, he once said: 'They feel that the old and
middle-aged may already have made so many compromises that they can no
longer confront the new tasks of today.'
Shortly after Hitler took power in 1933, Brandt's splinter group, aware that
he was in danger of arrest by the Nazis, decided to send him to Oslo. He was
smuggled out of Germany on a fishing smack, taking with him the name of
Willy Brandt which he had already been using as a pen-name.
It was the start of 12 years of exile. During his three attempts to run for
the chancellorship during the 1960s, Brandt's political enemies tried to use
this emigration to show that he was less than totally committed to his
country. Indeed, Brandt's views on Germany often seemed strangely detached.
He once said that Chancellor Helmut Kohl - with whom he forged, in his later
years, a close political relationship, though never real friendship - would
be a better leader if he knew a little more about the world outside.
Brandt became a Socialist activist in Scandinavia, returning briefly to
Berlin on an undercover mission. As a journalist on the Republican side in
1937, he witnessed the horrors of the Spanish civil war. In 1940 he was
arrested by the invading German forces in Norway, while wearing a Norwegian
uniform. Interned and then released, he fled to neutral Sweden, where he
continued his underground work, took Norwegian citizenship and met his
future wife, Rut, who was Norwegian-born. (His marriage to his first wife,
Carlota, whom he met in 1940, broke down in 1944. After his marriage to Rut
also ended in divorce, Brandt wed in 1983 the journalist and author Brigitte
Seebacher.)
Brandt returned to his defeated homeland in 1945, as a correspondent
covering the Nuremberg trials. He found his way back to the SPD, but
remained a Norwegian citizen until 1948. In 1947 he became press attache at
the Norwegian military mission in Berlin. Shortly afterwards, he met Edzard
Reuter, the SPD governing mayor of West Berlin during the 1948-49 blockade,
who heavily influenced Brandt's firm anti-Communist policies in Berlin
during the 1950s and 1960s.
In 1949 Brandt was elected to the Bundestag as a West Berlin deputy, and in
1955 he became president of the West Berlin senate. In November 1956 he
twice showed his oratorical skills by stopping crowds of Berliners, angered
by Soviet crushing of the Hungarian revolution, from rushing into East
Berlin towards bloody confrontation with Russian tanks.
In 1957 Brandt was elected governing mayor of West Berlin. This was a
crucial period: the SPD, under the guidance of the party's irascible
strategist Herbert Wehner, was moving to cast off the encumbrances of
Marxist ideology and reform itself into a modern Volkspartei (people's
party).
Brandt's experience in 1961, when he witnessed the western allies'
helplessness as the Berlin Wall was built, had a profound effect on his
future foreign policy. The implication was clear: however important Bonn's
links with the US, Washington was incapable of giving West Germany full
protection against the Soviet Union. Through building up relations with the
East, Bonn would eventually have to take greater initiative for securing its
own security.
After three years as foreign minister in the Grand Coalition with the
Christian Democrats of 1966-69, Brandt had the chance to put his precepts
into effect when he became chancellor in 1970, in coalition with the Free
Democrats. His finest hour came when the coalition was returned with an
increased majority in the 1972 elections, making the SPD the largest single
party in the Bundestag.
By 1972, the high points of his crusading European policies - the emotional
visit to Erfurt in East Germany in 1970, and his dramatic gesture later that
year, when he knelt at the Warsaw monument to the Jewish ghetto - were past.
The victory bloom soon wilted. As he ran into obstacles with France over
policies towards western Europe, he became bogged down by domestic
difficulties, particularly an outbreak of public-sector strikes.
In April 1974, Gunter Guillaume, an official in the Chancellery who had been
sufficiently close to Brandt to have accompanied him on holiday to Norway,
was arrested on charges of spying for East Germany. Under pressure from
Wehner, still the main SPD power-broker, and disheartened by the reluctance
of others (notably Hans-Dietrich Genscher, then interior minister) to
shoulder any of the blame for the resulting debacle, Brandt impulsively
accepted complete responsibility. He resigned from office.
By staying on as SPD chairman, Brandt hoped to foster party unity. In fact,
the relationship gradually worsened with the other members of the SPD
leadership - the increasingly neurotic Wehner, and Helmut Schmidt. As
Schmidt became a target of SPD left-wingers opposing his course on defence,
nuclear energy and the economy, the chancellor accused Brandt of countering
party discipline by encouraging the cause of younger radicals.
After the SPD went into opposition in 1982, and lost two general elections
in 1983 and 1987, it became clear that Brandt himself had contributed to the
party's sense of drift. In March 1987 a somewhat mindless row brought his
downfall as party chairman. His attempt to hire as SPD press officer an able
political scientist - a young woman, Greek-born, above all a non-party
member - proved too daring for some party stalwarts. Badly piqued, the
patriarch (who would have bowed out anyway in 1988) announced that he was
stepping down.
In a emotional two-hour farewell address at Bonn's Beethoven Hall in June
1987, Brandt declared that his brand of libertarian social democracy was one
where the leader would make mistakes. 'I have not always considered what
should be considered. I am sorry. And that is it.'
Conditioned by the threat Germany had once posed to its neighbours and to
itself, Brandt spent his life looking several ways at once. His greatest
service was to show that a certain ambiguity could buttress Germany's
position in the world rather than undermine it. His greatest regret may have
been to have died before he - or anyone else - could be completely sure that
the unification of the German nation would turn out an unmitigated success.
