  [Text] Hefei, March 2 (XINHUA) -- East China's Anhui 
Province received 153,000 visitors from both at home and abroad 
last year. 
  Tourism is now one of Anhui's major industries. Most tourist 
attractions are located in the southern part of the province, 
where Huangshan and Jiuhuashan Mountains and Taiping Lake are 
located. 
  In recent years Anhui's tourism has been developing at a 
high 
speed, with more tourist spots such as crocodile ponds, and 
monkey and deer islands opened, hotels built and cableways put 
into operation. 
  In 1993 Anhui successfully held several tourism festivals, 
which were also designed for business promotion and to attract 
investment. Foreign diplomats were also invited to visit the 
tourism sites.
