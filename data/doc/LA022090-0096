EXPLORING CAREERS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT; 
EDUCATION: SCOUTS GET A TASTE OF WHAT A REAL POLICE ACADEMY IS ALL ABOUT DURING 
A FOUR-DAY TRAINING SESSION AT EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION. 
About 90 Police Explorers graduated Monday from the Orange County Law 
Enforcement Explorer Academy held at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station over the 
weekend. 
The four-day program, held twice each year and staffed with volunteers, is for 
male and female Explorers ranging from 14 to 20 years in age who want a career 
in law enforcement or related fields, said Janie Walker, academy director and 
police reserve officer for the Costa Mesa Police Department. 
"We try to instill pride, leadership and confidence in these young adults," she 
said. "We try to make it as close to a real police academy with all the stress 
and a lot of push-ups. We all get about five hours of sleep a night." 
Walker said almost all Orange County police departments act as posts for the 
Explorer program, which is chartered through the Boy Scouts of America. 
Volunteers from the departments donate their time to staff the academy and 
teach 10 classes including criminal law, military drill, radio communications 
and canine patrol. 
"We also do a lot of competitive things between platoons," Walker said. "The 
Explorers are constantly competing for spirit and teamwork. This kind of 
competition is a natural kind of thing between people of this age group." 
At the end of the program, trophies are awarded for performance in the areas of 
physical agility, spirit, notebook quality, marching and final examination. A 
graduation is held for students, parents and police department dignitaries.
