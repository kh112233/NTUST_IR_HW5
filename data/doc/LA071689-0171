LATINO PANEL OFFERS IDEAS TO BRIDGE BILINGUAL GAP 
Lynne Gadbury helps decide whether students with limited English skills also 
have learning disabilities that would qualify them for special education 
programs. 
In the last school year, she says, she rejected almost half of the students 
that teachers recommended for special education, and sent them back to regular 
classes. 
Teachers said the children were not creative and were having trouble expressing 
themselves, according to Gadbury. But she says the children, rather than being 
slow learners with disabilities, simply could not speak English. And most of 
their teachers could not communicate in the students' native language. 
Growing Problem 
The inability of students and teachers to communicate is a growing problem in 
the Long Beach Unified School District, officials acknowledge. 
One of every four students in the district, including half of the Latino 
students, cannot speak English proficiently. But there are so few bilingual 
teachers that some special classes for non-English-speaking students are being 
taught by teachers who speak nothing but English, school officials say. 
Alarmed by the shortage of bilingual teachers, and Latino students' low test 
scores and high dropout rate, a Hispanic Advisory Committee has submitted to 
the Board of Education a series of proposals, including a recommendation that 
all teachers and administrators at some schools be required to learn a second 
language. 
Higher Pay Urged 
The five-member committee also recommended that the board: 
* Pay bilingual teachers a higher salary. 
* Agree to "an immediate" increase of 10% to 20% in the number of minority and 
bilingual employees. 
* Encourage bilingual teacher aides to attain teacher credentials. The 
committee's report did not offer a specific plan, but committee members said an 
internship program would be one possibility. 
Because of the lack of bilingual teachers, many students not fluent in English 
often end up in regular classes, where they are "left to fend for themselves 
and sink or swim," said committee member Jerome Torres. "That's why our kids 
are doing so badly in the system." 
Latino high school seniors in the district recorded below-average test scores 
last spring in the California Assessment Program. While the overall average for 
12th-graders was 218 in reading and 234 in mathematics, Latinos averaged 198 in 
reading and 206 in math, according to district statistics. 
"The system is failing in meeting the needs of these children. The district is 
monolingual and monocultural," Torres said. 
Latino children face a bleak future unless the public school system can offer 
role models and teachers who can communicate with students, committee members 
and other Latino leaders said. 
"What do we want for our future?" Edna Molina-Tobias, president of the Assn. of 
Hispanic Educators in Long Beach, said in an interview. "Do we want them to be 
busboys and grape pickers? Is that what we are destined to be?" 
Overall, school board members appeared receptive to the report, which board 
member Jenny Oropeza called "excellent." 
"For me, it's probably the most critical education issue we face in the Long 
Beach Unified School District," Oropeza said recently. "How are we going to 
teach these children who don't speak English? It's our responsibility. And I 
don't think we're doing it." 
Board member Bobbie Smith said: "We know we have not done well in terms of 
reaching Hispanics and other limited-English speaking populations. But the 
district is working hard to recruit bilingual instructors and minorities." 
A big part of the problem, district officials said, is the dearth of available 
minority and bilingual teachers. For example, while 29% of the district's 
students are Latino, only 4% of about 3,000 teachers are Latino, according to 
district statistics. 
Officials say they are trying to hire more Latinos and Asians, but few are 
applying. Supt. E. Tom Giugni said that of 382 applications received in recent 
months, 17 were from Latinos, for example. Of the 200 teachers hired last year, 
20 were Latino, he said. 
An Accepted Practice 
The shortage of bilingual teachers has prompted district officials to hire some 
new teachers on the condition that they will learn a second language within 
three years, said Felice Strauss, president of the Teachers Assn. of Long 
Beach. The practice is accepted by the state and done in other districts, said 
Mike Garcia, program administrator for Language Development Services. 
But there is little follow-up to ensure that the teachers do indeed learn a 
second language. "Unfortunately," Garcia said, "we don't have the staff to 
follow on it as much as we would like." 
Committee members cited the district's difficulty in recruiting bilingual 
teachers in urging the school board to make internal changes, such as requiring 
teachers, administrators and other support staff to learn a second language if 
at least 30% of the students in their school can't speak English. 
If that requirement had been in effect in the last school year, teachers and 
administrators in 19 schools would have been affected, according to Roberto 
Uranga, the Hispanic committee's chairman. 
Molina-Tobias, who teaches English language development at Benjamin Franklin 
Junior High School, said such a requirement would be "revolutionary, but we 
have to do something. 
"We are professionals. We have to keep up with the times. If that means taking 
courses in another language, so be it." 
Disagreement Expressed 
Board member Smith said the mandatory language requirement is "something we 
should take a look at. It's an interesting idea. . . . The average rational 
person knows that children have better self-esteem and tend to achieve better 
when they have role models or people who can speak their own language." 
Other board members and school officials disagreed with the proposed language 
requirement. 
Myrna Fujimoto, principal at Thomas Jefferson Junior High and one of the 
district's first bilingual teachers in the 1970s, said that a second-language 
requirement would be difficult to enforce. She suggested, instead, that 
teachers receive special training in how to deal with students who do not speak 
English properly. 
Gadbury, who speaks Spanish and has been screening students for the special 
education program since September, said she also favors special training. 
Board member Jerry Shultz praised the report, but expressed reservations about 
requiring teachers to learn a second language. He said he favors the concept of 
a pay differential for bilingual teachers and a program to encourage bilingual 
aides to become teachers. 
Concerns Not Named 
School board President Harriet Williams said the board probably would not 
approve a second-language requirement for at least a few years. Even then, it 
would probably apply only to new teachers. Supt. Giugni and Strauss, of the 
teachers' union, both said they have "some concerns" with a language 
requirement, but they declined to elaborate. 
Williams and Strauss also expressed concern about the recommendation to offer 
differential pay to bilingual staff members. 
"Right now, I'm not for it," Williams said. "So many of our teachers give 
extra." It would be unfair, she said, to pay some more than others. "I get the 
feeling from staff and teachers that it would be very divisive." 
Strauss said that the best solution would be to make teaching a more lucrative 
profession in general. Bilingual people, she said, too often are lured away by 
companies offering jobs with higher salaries and more prestige than teaching. 
"A lot needs to be done to improve the status of teachers," Strauss said. "We 
need to make teaching a profession people want to get into" by increasing all 
teachers' salaries and reducing class sizes, she said. 
Staff to Review It 
Giugni said the district's staff will review the report before individual 
suggestions are forwarded back to the school board for further consideration. 
During the June 12 board meeting, Williams told the committee: "This is a good 
report. It will not be put on the shelf." 
But board members set no deadline for when they will consider implementing the 
suggestions, and said it may take years before some of the changes might be 
made. 
Torres said that the committee will be "monitoring very closely" whether the 
school district acts on the report. "We're not going to let this issue die," he 
said. "The bottom line is that the Latino community is here to stay. And the 
school district has to deal with that." 
The committee was formed about three years ago by representatives of various 
Latino, educational and church organizations. At the time, committee members 
told the school board they would like to prepare a report, and Giugni gave his 
approval. 
WHERE THE TEACHERS ARE NEEDED 
The greatest need in Long Beach schools is for teachers who speak Spanish and 
Cambodian.
