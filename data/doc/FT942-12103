FT  03 MAY 94 / Mandela claims victory for ANC: Jubilation in S Africa as
white rule ends
African National Congress leader Mr Nelson Mandela last night declared South
Africa 'free at last', as thousands of people of all races celebrated the
election victory of the ANC and the final demise of apartheid.
With joy and emotion, Mr Mandela proclaimed: 'Thank God almighty, we are
free at last.' Jubilation broke out in black townships around the country as
it became clear that the ANC was headed for control of the new parliament.
Even the vanquished entered into the spirit of the moment, with President F.
W. de Klerk conceding defeat with words of generosity and warmth for his new
boss in the government of national unity. Mr de Klerk ended a
nationally-televised address with the words 'God bless South Africa, Nkosi
Sikele', African nationalism's hymn of liberation, now adopted as one of
South Africa's two national anthems.
Mr Mandela said it was 'a joyous night for the human spirit' and recounted
the many phone calls of congratulation he had received from almost all of
South Africa's political leaders, including Mr de Klerk and right-wing
leader General Constand Viljoen.
Only Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party and Mr
Mandela's main black rival, failed to join in the national catharsis. Last
night he warned of possible trouble because not everyone would accept a
large national victory for the ANC.
Earlier, Mr de Klerk had pledged his support for an ANC-led government of
national unity. 'Mr Mandela has walked a long road and now stands at the top
of the hill. A man of destiny knows that beyond this hill lies another and
another. The journey is never complete. As he contemplates the next hill, I
hold out my hand to Mr Mandela in friendship and in co-operation,' he told
his party faithful.
As results continued to trickle in, it became clear that the two men would
be working together as the two largest parties in the new government. ANC
information director Pallo Jordan predicted that the ANC would not gain the
two-thirds majority needed to give it absolute power over the parliament in
the writing of a new constitution, but would score between 58 and 62 per
cent of the vote.
With 43.9 per cent of the estimated 23m votes counted, the ANC had a
commanding lead with 63.3 per cent of the national vote, with the National
Party running at 23.3 per cent. No other party came close to these totals:
the Inkatha Freedom Party scored 5.9 per cent of the vote, the rightwing
Freedom Front of Gen Constand Viljoen 2.8 per cent, the liberal Democratic
Party 1.8 per cent and the ultra-left Pan Africanist Congress 1.3 per cent.
However, it is impossible to extrapolate from these figures, because results
are being released without identifying the neighbourhoods from which they
come. With residential areas so sharply divided by race, and with party
support also following racial lines, a concentration of results from one
racial area can substantially falsify projections.
In the provincial elections, the ANC was the runaway leader in the Northern
Transvaal, Eastern Transvaal, North-West, Orange Free State and Eastern
Cape. It remains unclear whether it would win the Northern Cape, Natal and
the Pretoria Witwatersrand and Vereeniging area.
In one of the few clear outcomes, the ANC conceded it had lost the Western
Cape province - one of only two provinces which do not have a majority of
Africans - to the National party.
Many uncertainties remain. In the disputed Natal province, only a fraction
of votes have been counted, apparently from areas where Inkatha is strong.
No accurate projections can be made from these early results.
