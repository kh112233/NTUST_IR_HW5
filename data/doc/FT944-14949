FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Advance of 16% at US healthcare
group
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare group that has recently agreed to buy
Eastman Kodak's diagnostic products division and the Neutrogena skin care
company, saw a 16 per cent increase in net profits in the third quarter in
spite of a big increase in its tax charge.
The profits growth was led by the group's pharmaceuticals division, which
increased sales by 21 per cent in the US and internationally because of
strong performances from new drugs, such as Risperdal, an anti-psychotic
medication for schizophrenia. The division had sales of Dollars 1.3bn.
The consumer division saw a 22 per cent increase in international sales,
mainly because of a strong performance from its operations in Brazil where
the local economy is recovering. Domestic growth was softer at 5 per cent,
leaving total sales 13 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.4bn.
The professional division, driven by rapid international growth, increased
sales by 12 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn.
Overall, group sales rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 4.04bn, of which 2
percentage points were attributable to the recent weakness of the dollar
against other currencies.
International sales advanced by 22 per cent - much faster than domestic
sales, which rose by 9 per cent.
Pre-tax profits rose by 22.5 per cent, but after the increase in the tax
charge, earnings per share were 17 per cent ahead at 82 cents.
