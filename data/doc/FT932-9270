FT  14 MAY 93 / Observer: Jacques' jottings
Who struck Francois Mitterrand as having 'the eyes of Stalin and the voice
of Marilyn Monroe'?
As an additional clue, the same person was eulogised by UK employment
minister Michael Forsyth at yesterday's Scottish Tory conference as
inspiring him by 'her determination to spread ownership, choice and
opportunity to all'.
The answer, of course, is Lady Thatcher.
Mitterrand's comment is recorded in the diary just published in France by
his erstwhile constant attendant, Jacques Attali of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
Called Verbatim and covering the six years between Mitterrand's election in
1981 and the Socialist party's 1986 general election defeat, it is the 17th
book that the 49-year- old Attali has found time to produce in his energetic
career. What's more, it will be followed by a second volume when the French
president leaves office in 1995.
The 960 pages of text already published contain many other quotable quotes
from international leaders, some worthy of being inscribed in marble.
Here's another on the Iron Lady delivered by then Italian premier Giulio
Andreotti after she'd been telling fellow EC leaders that she knew all about
small businesses because she herself had once worked in a three-person firm.
'What happened to the other two?', Andreotti whispered. 'No doubt they died
of work-related illnesses.'
