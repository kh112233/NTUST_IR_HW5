FT  14 MAY 94 / Report to Miti urges delaying plutonium use
A government panel is to propose that Japan delays ambitious plans to
increase its use of plutonium as a nuclear fuel.
The suggestion, to be presented to the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry next month for consideration as official policy, comes in response
to growing domestic and international concern over a surplus of plutonium, a
highly toxic fuel that can be used for nuclear weapons.
An interim report, by the advisory committee for energy, calls for
construction of a second plutonium powered fast-breeder reactor to be
delayed from the end of this decade to early next, according to details
leaked by officials. It suggests that plans for a second fuel reprocessing
plant - which extracts plutonium from spent fuel - should be suspended until
well beyond 2010.
Japan's first prototype fast-breeder, named Monju, based on the west coast,
began a self-sustaining reaction last month, using plutonium fuel produced
at reprocessing plants in Britain and France.
Its first reprocessing plant, at Rokkasho-mura in northern Japan is due to
start operations at the end of the decade. A second Japanese reprocessing
plant was due to open in 2010, but the panel says that a construction
schedule should not be decided until then, implying that it could not start
operating at least until 2020.
A decline in prices for uranium, the fuel used in conventional nuclear power
stations, has weakened the economic argument for plutonium fuelled fast
breeder reactors, said an official at the government's agency of national
resources and energy. However, this would only be a temporary delay in long
term plans to increase Japan's use of plutonium.
