FT  26 APR 91 / FDA backs drug despite law suits
ELI LILLY, which is facing a deluge of lawsuits claiming its best-selling
anti-depressant Prozac makes patients murderous or suicidal, yesterday said
a liquid version of the drug had been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) to treat depression.
Mr Leigh Thompson, vice-president of Lilly Research Laboratories said: 'The
company welcomes this announcement as another affirmation of the safety and
efficacy of Prozac in relieving clinical depression.'
Lilly claims to be the victim of a smear campaign by litigious products
liability lawyers and the Church of Scientology, a cult-like quasi-religious
group which is hostile to psychiatry and has labelled the drug 'a killer.'
Prozac has been favoured by doctors since it hit the US market in December
1987, largely because it lacks many of the side-effects associated with
similar products.
The drug is considered less toxic than other anti-depressants and Lilly
claims it is extremely difficult for patients to kill themselves with
Prozac. Lilly said that of the 3.5m patients who had taken the drug, there
had been only one death by overdose using Prozac.
The publicity and litigation has had some effect on Prozac's command of the
anti-depressant market. Prozac's sales have slid to 21 per cent from about
25 per cent in July.
