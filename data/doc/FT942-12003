FT  03 MAY 94 / Observer: Summertime blues
Volkswagen supervisory board chairman Klaus Liesen must be heartily sick of
the Lopez affair. Dragged back early from his Majorcan holiday last summer
when the industrial espionage case first blew up, he has been grumbling that
the investigation may dish plans to freshen the tan this year too.
That particular grim prospect dawned during last Thursday's interview with
US justice department officials in London - a meeting which Liesen decided
to attend, the alternative being an invite to America under subpoena.
While German investigators are still ploughing through the data seized from
VW last August, fleeter-footed Washington sleuths have arrived on their back
doorstep.
Following an exchange with his questioners about the hiring of Basque
production genius Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua from General Motors last
spring, Liesen agreed willingly to further interviews - on similar, any
time, anywhere, terms.
Holiday or none, the grizzled Prussian lawyer wants to be helpful, you see.
With retirement looming from his main job as chairman of Ruhrgas, it's in
his interests to try and look as upright and effective a non-executive as
possible.
But he far from relishes the thought of having to remain on base for many a
week to come. Making himself available at Ruhrgas's head office, on the
other hand, might speed up proceedings. One visit to Essen is normally
enough for almost any visitor.
