FT  25 MAR 93 / Summer sell-off for Ulster electricity
THE privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity will go ahead early this
summer in a sale likely to raise about Pounds 300m, Michael Smith writes.
The sale of NIE will complete the privatisation of the Northern Ireland
electricity industry, which started last April with the sale of four power
stations.
The decision follows European Community approval of a Pounds 60m grant
towards a Pounds 200m investment programme for a new power line from
Scotland.
Uncertainty about the grant last year held up the flotation.
Completion of the privatisation of the non-nuclear electricity industry is
likely next year when the government is expected to sell its remaining 40
per cent stakes in PowerGen and National Power.
