COURT OVERTURNS EMBRYO RULING 
The Tennessee Court of Appeals today granted joint custody of seven frozen 
embryos to a divorced couple, overturning a landmark ruling that had granted 
custody to the ex-wife. 
The intermediate-level appeals court ruled in the divorce case of Junior Lewis 
Davis of Maryville and his former wife, Mary Sue Davis Stowe, now of 
Titusville, Fla. 
"It would be repugnant and offensive to constitutional principals to order Mary 
Sue to implant these fertilized ova against her will," Judge Herschel P. Franks 
wrote for the three-member court. 
"It would be equally repugnant to order Junior to bear the psychological, if 
not the legal, consequences of paternity against his will." 
The court ruled that both Stowe and Davis should "share an interest in the 
seven fertilized ova" and should have joint control and an equal voice over 
their disposition.
