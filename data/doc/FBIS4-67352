  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Japan will strengthen a 
regulation on domestic transactions in ivory and crocodile skin 
as part of its obligations under an international treaty to 
preserve endangered species, Environmental Agency officials said 
Friday (915 April]. 
  The government endorsed at a cabinet meeting a plan to 
submit 
to the current Diet session a revised bill for preserving 
animals and plants facing extinction. 
  The revised bill regulates domestic transactions of parts of 
animals such as skin, plumes and bones, in addition to the 
bodies themselves, including stuffed ones. 
  The Washington Convention -- the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora -- bans 
international trade in animal bodies and stuffed animals of 
species at risk. 
  Japan ratified the convention in 1980 and enacted a related 
law in 1987, which is the measure the government is now planning 
to revise. 
  The Environment Agency will introduce a measure to 
distinguish between contraband goods and ones imported legally 
before Japan started applying the Washington Convention rules. 
  The revised bill will require importers and processors of 
animal bodies to register and attach seals or tags of 
certification to each product, agency officials said.
