Resources (Hurricane Andrew) 



<AGENCY>

ACTION:

 Interim final rules with request for comments.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Some supplemental security income (SSI) recipients who were victims of Hurricane Andrew in south Florida have not
been able to replace or repair their damaged homes due to circumstances beyond their control. This means that some
SSI recipients will have resources (insurance money) in amounts that will disqualify them for SSI benefits if held
for periods exceeding the maximum 18-month period provided in regulations at 416.1232. Since Hurricane Andrew
occurred in August 1992, some SSI recipients could become ineligible as early as March 1994. We are codifying in regulations,
interim final rules which provide additional time for victims of Hurricane Andrew to make arrangements to effect
repair or replacement of excluded property without interruption of their SSI benefits.

<DATE>
DATES:

 Effective Date: This rule is effective March 17, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew devastated south Florida causing damage estimated in excess of $18 billion. According
to published reports, of the 47,000 homes destroyed, 32,000 are still uninhabitable. Only 10 percent of 140,000 damaged
homes have been rebuilt or repaired because the number of contractors available to rebuild homes is steadily decreasing.




We estimate that approximately 450 SSI recipients, who were victims of Hurricane Andrew, have received payments
from private insurance companies for the repair or replacement of their property, but because of the extent of the
devastation, they have not yet been able to repair or replace their homes and property. 




The regulations at 416.1205(c) provide that SSI recipients can have no more than $2,000 in countable resources
and SSI couples can have no more than $3,000. The regulations at 416.1237 provide that assistance received
under the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act or other assistance provided under a Federal statute because
of a catastrophe which is declared to be a major disaster by the President of the United States or comparable assistance
received from a State or local government, or from a disaster assistance organization, is excluded permanently under
416.1210 in determining countable resources. 


The regulations at 416.1232 complement the disaster assistance exclusion by providing that cash or in-kind
items for the repair or replacement of lost, stolen, or damaged excluded resources are not treated as resources for
9 months, plus one extension for a reasonable period up to an additional 9 months for good cause if circumstances do
not permit repair or replacement within the initial 9-month period and the individual intends to use the funds for
repair or replacement. 


Excluded resources generally include the individual's home, household goods and personal effects, and the automobile,
as are described in 416.1212, 416.1216 and 416.1218 respectively. 


Private insurance payments do not qualify as disaster assistance and, therefore, cannot be permanently excluded.
For some of these SSI recipients, the maximum period of 18 months during which monies to repair or replace excluded
resources are not treated as resources is about to expire. Because of the vast devastation caused by Hurricane Andrew,
these individuals have not been able to rebuild or repair their homes. We estimate that, as early as March 1994, some
of these individuals will begin to lose SSI eligibility. 


We propose interim final regulations to amend 416.1232(b) for victims of Hurricane Andrew only, to extend
the maximum 18-month period during which cash or in-kind replacement received from any source for purposes of repairing
or replacing an excluded resource is not treated as a resource:
