FT  06 JUN 94 / Bhutto brother released
Mr Murtaza Bhutto, estranged brother of Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime
minister, was freed from prison on bail yesterday, having been held for
seven months on insurgency charges, Reuter reports from Karachi.
Ms Bhutto told reporters in Islamabad that her brother was now welcome to
join her ruling Pakistan People's party, if he accepted its manifesto.
A special terrorism court freed Mr Bhutto on bail of Rs1m (Pounds 21,590)
because it had insufficient evidence to keep him in custody.
