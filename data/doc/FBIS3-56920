  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 20 -- Lithuanian Seimas [parliament] 
ratified Lithuanian-Latvian-Estonian free trade agreement that 
was signed last September in Tallinn by heads of the three 
governments. 
  Latvian and Estonian parliaments ratified the agreement 
before the New Year. 
  The agreement which is not limited in time will come into 
force in February 1. It will be directed at industrial goods 
and some agreed foodstuffs. No export or import taxes will be 
imposed in accordance with it and those already imposed will be 
immediately abolished. Some limitations in quantity of the 
goods are provided in the additions of the agreement and they 
will be revised every year.
