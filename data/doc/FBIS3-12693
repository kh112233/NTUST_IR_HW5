Highlights Plane Incident"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- The Libyan opposition has once 
again highlighted the incident of the crash of the Libyan plane 
which was flying from Benghazi to Tripoli in December 1992. 
  In a statement issued by Bashir al-Rabiti, head of the 
Libyan 
National Organization, the opposition held the Revolutionary 
Committees responsible for blowing up the plane with a view to 
killing three people who had important information about the 
Lockerbie explosion. 
  The statement quoted "eyewitnesses" as saying that elements 
from the Revolutionary Committees "arrived one hour before the 
plane took off from Baninah airport and issued stern orders to 
airport security officials not to search the elements that had 
entered the plane with three suitcases [haqa'ib] containing 
explosives." 
  The statement added that "the information available 
indicates 
that the three targeted people tried first to travel via the 
seaport of Benghazi but were prevented from doing so, and their 
movements were put under observation for fear of their releasing 
information about Lockerbie. Then it was decided to liquidate 
them." 
  The statement pointed out that Interior Minister Ibrahim 
al-Bakkar, who ordered the formation of a committee to 
investigate the explosion of the plane and begin its work after 
the Arab interior ministers' conference, met his death [laqiya 
hatfuh] while on his way back from the conference in Tunis.
