IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
NEUTRONS AID CANCER FIGHT 
Bombarding tumors with high-energy neutrons instead of X-rays doubles the 
percentage of men who survive certain inoperable prostate cancers and could 
save the lives of one-fourth of those now killed by the disease, scientists 
said last week. 
Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. men after 
lung and colorectal cancer. About 103,000 U.S. men will develop the disease 
this year, and 28,500 who have it will die, according to the American Cancer 
Society. 
Dr. George Laramore of the University of Washington School of Medicine in 
Seattle said the study he led indicates that one-quarter of those who die each 
year could be saved by nationwide adoption of neutron radiation as the 
treatment for such men. 
Neutrons are electrically neutral particles in the nucleus, or center, of an 
atom. They are massive particles, while X-rays are a form of electromagnetic 
radiation, as is light. Beams of neutrons attack cancer cells with about 100 
times the energy of X-rays, Laramore said. 
The study was conducted at the university and other institutions. It involved 
91 men whose cancer spread beyond the prostate. Five years after treatment, 70% 
of those who received neutron radiation remain alive, twice the 35% survival 
rate among those treated with X-rays.
