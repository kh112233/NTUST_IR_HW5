A report containing final results of tests on drinking water at USA Today 
offices in Arlington, Va., says average levels of lead are 3 1/2 times the 
federal guidelines and the likely source of the contamination is lead solder 
used on plumbing fixtures in the two buildings, the Washington Post reported. 
Sheila Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Gannett Co., which owns the national 
newspaper, said the buildings' owners have begun a program that involves 
injecting sodium silicate, a nontoxic substance, into the water system. Within 
60 to 90 days, the chemical gives the pipes and solder joints a protective 
coating that prevents leaching of lead into the water. The tests were conducted 
after employees became concerned over an unusually high number of miscarriages 
among women in the newsroom.
