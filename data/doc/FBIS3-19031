  [Text] The IRA will not bomb the peace process off track, 
Irish Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring said today. 
  Security co-operation would continue at the highest possible 
level and political talks should go on, Mr Spring said after the 
second terrorist attack on London's Heathrow Airport within as 
many days. 
  "We are not going to be put off course by the IRA or by 
these 
despicable acts in which they have engaged in the last 48 
hours," he told RTE radio in Dublin. 
  "I think what is important is that both governments have 
made 
it very clear that we are determined to work on and obviously 
there is responsibility on all politicians now to see if we can 
resume the dialogue on Northern Ireland." 
  There was no "political vacuum," he insisted. 
  Asked whether the latest mortar bomb attack had bankrupted 
the IRA and Sinn Fein in his eyes, Mr Spring said: "What has 
happened in the last 48 hours has been quite outrageous in 
relation to the efforts of both governments to establish peace 
on this island. We must condemn them out of hand." 
  He had been studying Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams's 
remarks about IRA "spectaculars," he said, adding: "I have to 
say I think those remarks are absolutely outrageous in terms of 
what the governments are trying to do. We have been trying to 
build on the Downing Street declaration."
