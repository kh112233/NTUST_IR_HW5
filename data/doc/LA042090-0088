BRIEFLY 
FDA Orders Perrier to Change Its Labels: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
told Perrier to remove the phrase "naturally sparkling" from bottles of the 
imported mineral water. 
The FDA said Perrier's claim to be "naturally sparkling" is false because the 
water is not naturally carbonated as it comes out of the ground at a spring in 
Vergeze, France. The water from the spring is mixed with carbon dioxide from a 
gas reservoir beneath it after impurities in the gas are filtered out. The firm 
said all Perrier bottled after July 29 would bear the new label, which will 
say, "Natural mineral water."
