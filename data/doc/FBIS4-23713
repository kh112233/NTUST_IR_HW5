  [Text] Bujumbura, 13 Jun (PANA) -- An armed attack on 
Monday [13 June] morning killed fifteen civilians and seriously 
wounded five in the center of Kayanza, a town in the central 
Burundian province of Kayanza, at the border with Butare 
(southern Rwanda), Burundian radio announced on Monday. 
  Quoting the Kayanza District commander, the radio added that 
the streets of the town were deserted. The inhabitants who were 
surprised in their sleep by the attack remained at home waiting 
for calm to return. 
  A similar attack occurred last weekend when grenades were 
thrown into a pub, seriously wounding eleven people, one of whom 
died in hospital and two are still in a critical state, medical 
sources said. Since Friday, violent clashes have been taking 
place between the regular Army and armed gangs based on the 
hills around Bujumbura, the Burundian capital. 
  Burundian radio, quoting military sources, said the death 
toll was six among the assailants and two among the military. 
  Interim president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya is currently in 
Tunis attending the 30th summit of OAU heads of states and 
governments.
