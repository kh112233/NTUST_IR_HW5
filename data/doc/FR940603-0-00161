<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing a final rule amending the final monograph for over-the-counter
(OTC) antitussive drug products to include the ingredients diphenhydramine citrate and diphenhydramine hydrochloride.
OTC antitussive drug products are used to relieve cough. This final rule addresses only single-ingredient antitussive
drug products containing one of these ingredients. In a future issue of the 

Federal Register

, the agency will propose to amend the tentative final monograph for OTC cold, cough, allergy, bronchodilator, and
antiasthmatic combination drug products to address combination cough-cold drug products containing diphenhydramine
citrate or diphenhydramine hydrochloride. This final rule is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted
by FDA.

I. Background


In the 

Federal Register

 of August 12, 1987 (52 FR 30042), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC antitussive drug products in part 341 (21 CFR part
341) that lists in 341.14 (21 CFR 341.14) the active ingredients that are generally recognized as safe and effective
for use in these products. Diphenhydramine citrate and diphenhydramine hydrochloride were not included in 341.14
at that time. Subsequently, two manufacturers petitioned the agency to amend the final monograph for OTC antitussive
drug products to include diphenhydramine citrate and diphenhydramine hydrochloride as monograph active ingredients
(Refs. 1 and 2). The petitions are on display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA305), Food and Drug Administration,
rm. 123, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. 
In the 

Federal Register

 of December 9, 1992 (57 FR 58378), the agency discussed these petitions and proposed that diphenhydramine citrate
and diphenhydramine hydrochloride be generally recognized as safe and effective for OTC antitussive use. The agency
previously determined that diphenhydramine citrate is bioequivalent and therapeutically equivalent to diphenhydramine
hydrochloride (54 FR 6814 at 6824, February 14, 1989). The agency proposed specific warnings and directions for these
ingredients for OTC antitussive use. The agency advised in its proposed rule (57 FR 58378 at 58380) that any final rule
resulting from this proposed rule would be effective 12 months after the final rule's date of publication in the 

Federal Register

.
The agency invited written comments by February 8, 1993, on the proposed rule and the agency's economic impact determination
for the proposal. In response to the proposed rule, the agency received two comments from manufacturers. Copies of
the comments are on public display in the Dockets Management Branch (address above).

II. The Agency's Conclusions on the Comments


1. Two comments requested that the agency's proposed OTC antitussive dosage for diphenhydramine hydrochloride
(25 milligrams (mg) every 4 hours (h), not to exceed 150 mg in 24 h) be expanded to a range of 25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6 h, not
to exceed 300 mg in 24 h. One of the comments also requested a corresponding expansion of the OTC antitussive dosage
for diphenhydramine citrate, i.e., a dosage of 38 to 76 mg every 4 to 6 h, not to exceed 456 mg in 24 h.
To support an expanded dosage range for antitussive use, one of the comments provided pharmacokinetic data for diphenhydramine
hydrochloride dosed at 25 mg every 4 h and 50 mg every 6 h. The data included the following steady state concentrations
(C

ss

), minimum concentrations at steady state (C

ss min

), and maximum concentrations at steady state (C

ss max

) in nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL) for both dosages; and the areas under the curve (AUC) for both dosages in ng x h/mL:

</TABLE>


The comment pointed out that the two C

ss min

 concentrations are comparable. The comment stated that the 50 mg every 6 h dosing regimen is as efficacious as the 25
mg every 4 h regimen because the 50 mg dose does not fall below the minimum effective concentration. The comment added
that further substantiation is provided by the C

ss

 and AUC data, which fall within the minimum effective concentration levels.


The other comment stated that the potential for conflict between the different dosages for antitussive and antihistamine
use of diphenhydramine would be eliminated by accepting the broader antihistamine dosage (e.g., for diphenhydramine
hydrochloride, 25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6 h, not to exceed 300 mg in 24 h) for products intended for both uses. The comment
added that this approach would reduce the potential for consumer confusion. The comment argued that it would not be
in the consumer's interest to establish a lower dose for diphenhydramine in products that will not meet consumer expectations
of the antihistamine effect. The comment contended that, based on the established safety of diphenhydramine citrate
and diphenhydramine hydrochloride for both antitussive and antihistamine use, monograph status for four uses,
and potential use for more than one indication in a cough-cold product, the broader dosage range (e.g., for diphenhydramine
hydrochloride, 25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6 h) should be permitted to provide maximum effectiveness. Both comments concluded
that diphenhydramine hydrochloride has been found safe for a variety of OTC uses at dosages of 25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6
h and, thus, safety is not an issue at this dosage range. 
In the 

Federal Register

 of September 9, 1976 (41 FR 38312 at 38341), the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Cold, Cough, Allergy, Bronchodilator,
and Antiasthmatic Drug Products based its 25 mg every 4 h recommendation for diphenhydramine hydrochloride for antitussive
use on data demonstrating effectiveness and acceptable tolerability at this dosage. All approved applications
for diphenhydramine hydrochloride as an OTC antitussive are for a dosage of 25 mg every 4 h, based on supporting clinical
data. No clinical data have been received by the agency to support the safety or increased effectiveness of higher
dosages of diphenhydramine hydrochloride or diphenhydramine citrate for OTC antitussive use either under the OTC
drug review or an approved application. One comment submitted pharmacokinetic data concerning diphenhydramine
at both the 25 mg every 4 h dose and the 50 mg every 6 h dose showing that C

ss

 min for both regimens were similar. It is therefore likely that dosing at 50 mg every 6 h is effective. That regimen,
however, produces higher C

ss max

 and almost twice the drug exposure, with increased potential adverse effects such as sedation, but with no evidence
of greater effectiveness than the every 4 h regimen. In conclusion, the agency cannot consider to be generally recognized
as safe and effective an antitussive dosage (25 to 50 mg every 4 to 6 h for diphenhydramine hydrochloride) that is not
supported by clinical data. Therefore, based on the Panel's recommended dosage and the approved application labeling
for OTC antitussive drug products containing diphenhydramine hydrochloride, the agency is establishing the monograph
antitussive dosage of diphenhydramine hydrochloride as follows: 


Adults and children 12 years of age and over: oral dosage is 25 milligrams every 4 hours, not to exceed 150 milligrams
in 24 hours, or as directed by a doctor. Children 6 to under 12 years of age: oral dosage is 12.5 milligrams every 4 hours,
not to exceed 75 milligrams in 24 hours, or as directed by a doctor. Children under 6 years of age: consult a doctor.


The monograph antitussive dosage of diphenhydramine citrate is as follows: 


Adults and children 12 years of age and over: oral dosage is 38 milligrams every 4 hours, not to exceed 228 milligrams
in 24 hours, or as directed by a doctor. Children 6 to under 12 years of age: oral dosage is 19 milligrams every 4 hours,
not to exceed 114 milligrams in 24 hours, or as directed by a doctor. Children under 6 years of age: consult a doctor.


With respect to the comment's discussion of a single ingredient drug product containing diphenhydramine for concurrent
use as both an antihistamine and an antitussive, this issue will be addressed in an amendment to the OTC cough-cold
combinations tentative final monograph in a future issue of the 

Federal Register

. 
2. One comment discussed ``multiuse'' labeling of OTC drug products that contain diphenhydramine. The comment described
this as labeling a product with some or all of the proven pharmacologic activities of the drug whether or not the conditions
to be treated are related. As an example, the comment stated that a product containing diphenhydramine could be labeled
for both antitussive and antihistamine use. If this occurred, the statement of identity could be expressed as ``cough
suppressant/antihistamine.'' The comment stated that the product's labeling could describe each use separately
under the product's ``Indications,'' with accompanying warnings and directions for both uses. The comment contended
that there is no legal restriction that prevents ``multiuse'' labeling whether or not the conditions to be treated
are related. The comment discussed several aspects of ``multiuse'' labeling. 
This final rule addresses only single-ingredient diphenhydramine citrate and diphenhydramine hydrochloride
drug products for antitussive use. The agency acknowledges that ``multiuse'' labeling is possible for products
containing diphenhydramine but is not aware of any such products having been or currently being in the marketplace.
The agency intends to address ``multiuse'' labeling in a future issue of the 

Federal Register

 in an amendment to the tentative final monograph for OTC cough-cold combination drug products. The agency will discuss:
(1) Concurrent use of diphenhydramine as an antitussive and as an antihistamine for concurrent symptoms, and (2)
different uses of diphenhydramine with separate full labeling for different, nonconcurrent symptoms. Manufacturers
may not introduce diphenhydramine products having ``multiuse'' labeling into the OTC marketplace until the agency's
proposal on how this should be done appears in a future issue of the 

Federal Register

.
3. One comment contended that an agency statement in the proposed rule appeared to be inconsistent with the agency's
general provisions and administrative procedures for marketing OTC combination drug products under 21 CFR 330.13(b)(2)
and Compliance Policy Guide 7132b.16. The agency statement said: ``Until the agency amends the tentative final monograph
for OTC cough-cold combination drug products, no cough-cold combination drug product containing diphenhydramine
citrate or diphenhydramine hydrochloride labeled for antitussive use can be marketed OTC unless it is the subject
of an approved NDA or ANDA'' (57 FR 58378 at 58380). The comment stated that, because FDA recognizes diphenhydramine
as both an OTC antihistamine and an OTC antitussive, marketing of diphenhydramine for both claims in combination
drug products should be allowed under the provisions of the tentative final monograph for OTC cough-cold combination
drug products. The comment listed a number of examples where an antitussive can be combined with an antihistamine
and stated that diphenhydramine should be able to perform both functions in the product. The comment contended that
this approach should be acceptable provided that all of the labeled uses are for Category I combinations.
This final rule does not address combination drug products containing diphenhydramine citrate or diphenhydramine
hydrochloride as an antitussive active ingredient. There are a number of issues that need to be resolved before diphenhydramine
can be used to perform both functions (antitussive and antihistamine) in a single product. These include, among others,
a difference in the monograph directions for use (amount of drug to be taken and time interval for taking the drug) and
different warnings related to the individual uses. The agency intends to discuss these matters in a future issue of
the 

Federal Register

, as noted above. At this time, the agency reaffirms its position stated above that any OTC cough-cold combination
drug product containing diphenhydramine citrate or diphenhydramine hydrochloride labeled for antitussive use
can only be marketed if it is the subject of an approved application.
No comments were received in response to the agency's request for specific comment on the economic impact of this rulemaking.
FDA has examined the impacts of this final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and, thus, is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Currently marketed OTC single ingredient diphenhydramine drug products already
meet the conditions of the final monograph. Other manufacturers will be able to enter the OTC marketplace without
having to obtain an approved application. Accordingly, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further
analysis is required.
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
