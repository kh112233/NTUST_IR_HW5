ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing 
regulations to require label warning statements for products 
taken in solid oral dosage form to supplement the dietary intake 
of iron or to provide iron for therapeutic purposes. FDA is also 
proposing regulations to require unit-dose packaging
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 for iron-containing products that contain 30 milligrams (mg) or more of 
iron per dosage unit.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 FDA is proposing these regulations 
because of the acute iron poisonings, including deaths in 
children less than 6 years of age, attributable to accidental 
overdoses of iron-containing products. The intent of these 
proposed regulations is to reduce the risk of accidental iron poisonings of young children by utilizing FDA's authority
in 
conjunction with the existing requirements of the U.S. Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) for child-resistant packaging 
for household substances. This proposal responds to three 
citizen petitions (Docket Nos. 91P0186/CP1, 93P0306/CP1, and 
930306/CP2) that requested that FDA take action to ensure that 
products containing iron or iron salts do not pose a health 
hazard to young children and infants.
