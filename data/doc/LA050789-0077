HEAT DEATH OF MENTAL PATIENT INVESTIGATED 
San Bernardino County prosecutors have launched an investigation to determine 
whether criminal negligence contributed to the death of a mental patient who 
had been subjected to 110-degree heat while locked in a room at Patton State 
Hospital. 
Francisco Morfin, 23, of Los Angeles died last September shortly after being 
found slumped in a chair with a body temperature of 104.6 degrees, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Jim Hackleman. 
The coroner's office attributed Morfin's death to a toxic effect related to the 
drug lithium, widely prescribed for people with mental disorders. A deputy 
coroner said toxicity was caused by the combination of the high room 
temperature, dehydration caused by lithium and clogged arteries.
