WORLD; 
NUN DIES IN N. IRELAND BOMBING 
A huge bomb exploded today on the outskirts of the border city of Armagh, 
killing a Roman Catholic nun and three policeman, police said. 
The murder of the nun was thought to be the first time a nun has been killed in 
21 years of sectarian violence in British-run Northern Ireland. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion immediately fell 
on the Irish Republican Army. The killing of a nun would be seen widely as a 
grave embarrassment to the mainly Catholic IRA. 
The bomb, planted in a drain beneath a road, blew apart an unmarked police car, 
instantly killing the three officers traveling in it. The nun, who died later 
in hospital from severe injuries, was traveling with a woman social worker in a 
separate car caught in the blast.
