Utah officials voted to free nearly half of a $5-million legislative 
appropriation to fund research into the University of Utah's cold fusion 
findings. An executive committee of the state's Fusion-Energy Advisory Council 
endorsed the university's request for nearly $2.5 million for the first year of 
cold fusion research. The goal of the research is to develop a cheap, 
relatively safe and virtually inexhaustible source of electrical energy. Next 
Monday, the full council is expected to approve the budget.
