FT  22 SEP 93 / World Bank 'must take on more risk'
THE Institute of International Finance, which represents many large
commercial banks, yesterday called on the World Bank and regional
development banks to assume bigger risks in support of their lending to
private sector investment in the developing world, writes Peter Norman,
Economics Editor, in Washington.
Mr Charles Dallara, the IIF's managing director, said international
financing institutions should revise some of their lending rules to
encourage private capital flows. In a letter to Mr Philippe Maystadt,
Belgian finance minister and recently-elected chairman of the IMF's
policy-making interim committee, he suggested the World Bank and regional
developments banks should think again about their insistence that
governments in countries borrowing from them should guarantee all their
loans.
Mr Dallara also suggested the institutions should provide coverage of a
broader definition of political risk in countries such as Russia to attract
private capital.
