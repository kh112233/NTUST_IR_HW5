ENGINEER IN RAIL CRASH ASKS LENIENCY 
The railroad engineer blamed for the deadliest train wreck in Amtrak history -- 
16 dead, at least 175 injured -- is seeking a reduction in his five-year 
sentence for manslaughter. Lawyers for Ricky Gates, the Conrail engineer who 
smoked marijuana shortly before his string of three locomotives strayed into 
the path of a speeding passenger train near Baltimore on Jan. 4., 1987, asked a 
Baltimore County circuit judge to reduce his time because of good behavior and 
to allow him to begin serving concurrently a three-year federal sentence for 
lying to investigators.
