P.M. BRIEFING; 
JAPANESE FIRM TO BUY LYPHOMED 
Lyphomed Inc. said today it has agreed to be bought by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical 
Co. Ltd., a Japanese firm that already owns 30% of the drug manufacturer, for 
about $670 million. 
Lyphomed, based in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, enjoyed explosive growth in 
the mid-1980s, largely through its sales of pentamidine, a drug used to treat 
AIDS-related pneumonia. Overall sales soared from $4 million to $172 million 
from 1981 through 1987. 
Lyphomed makes primarily injectable pharmaceutical products used by critically 
ill people. 
The company ran into hard times last year after the federal Food and Drug 
Administration uncovered quality control problems at several Lyphomed plants. 
It lost $21.1 million in 1988. Lyphomed has since shuffled top management and 
posted a profit of $105,000 on revenues of $71.7 million in the first six 
months of 1989.
