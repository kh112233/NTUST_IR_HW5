COLUMBIA CREW CLOSES IN ON SATELLITE QUARRY 
Columbia's astronauts mopped up water from a leaky dehumidifier today as they 
closed in on the floating science laboratory they plan to pluck from space 
Friday with the shuttle's robot arm. 
Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee executed three engine-firing 
maneuvers today, putting Columbia on a near-collision course with the satellite 
they have been chasing since they were launched Tuesday onto a path 1,725 miles 
behind their quarry. 
Once the astronauts move in on the 11-ton target, they will fly in formation 35 
feet away while mission specialist Bonnie Dunbar reaches out with Columbia's 
50-foot mechanical arm to snare the 30-foot satellite, which is as large as a 
small school bus. 
If all goes well, she will make the catch at 9:48 a.m. Friday. 
The shuttle this morning was reported to be within 300 miles of the satellite, 
known as the Long Duration Exposure Facility. 
Brandenstein and mission specialist David Low interrupted their flight plans 
for more than two hours today to cope with the leak of about two gallons of 
water, shown on television as a slow bubbling of water beads. 
They shut off the faulty dehumidifier, shifted to a backup, and then went to 
work on the water with towels and a hand-held vacuum, using a flashlight to dry 
cables and other surfaces. Loose water, which forms beads and globules in 
weightlessness, can interfere with electronics. 
Looking at all the equipment that had to be moved to get at the water, 
Brandenstein remarked, "It's kind of a mess right now. I'll get the 
plumber-of-the-year award, but not the housekeeper-of-the-year award." 
Scientists are eager to examine the satellite to learn how various systems and 
materials withstood the long stay in orbit, information that will help in 
designing the space station and other space vehicles.
