FT  19 MAR 94 / Boycott threat fells timber deal - News in brief
Protests against 'clear-cut' logging in British Columbia have led two big UK
paper companies to cancel pulp contracts with MacMillan Bloedel, the
Canadian forest products group. Kimberly-Clark's UK subsidiary has pulled
out of a Dollars 2m deal with MacMillan, while Scott Paper earlier cancelled
a Dollars 5m contract. Both companies have faced threats by Greenpeace to
organise a consumer boycott in protest against MacMillan's logging practices
in the picturesque Clayoquot Sound area of Vancouver Island. Clayoquot Sound
contains one of the biggest remaining old-growth forests in North America.
The British Columbia government has tried to steer a compromise between
environmentalists calling for a total ban on logging in the area, and the
forestry companies which maintain that the trees are essential to the
survival of nearby mills. The unsightly bare patches left by clear-cutting
have given the environmental movement a powerful publicity weapon. MacMillan
maintains however, that Greenpeace has misrepresented its forestry
practices. The company has launched an aggressive advertising campaign in
Canada and Europe to defend itself against the environmentalists' charges.
