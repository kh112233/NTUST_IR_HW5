U.S. GEARING FOR CUTBACKS OF $85 BILLION 
As things stand now, if Congress and the White House fail to reach a budget 
agreement by midnight Sunday, the federal government will have to slash its 
spending by a staggering $85 billion, causing sharp cutbacks in services that 
will quickly be felt by millions of Americans. 
Sharp reductions in money for programs -- and the furloughing of thousands of 
federal employees -- would disrupt commercial air traffic, reduce access to 
national parks, cause delays at ports of entry and trigger shortages of fresh 
meats, weather forecasts and even coins. 
That is but a sampling of the potentially far-reaching consequences of a 
continuing budget stalemate that could, under the Gramm-Rudman deficit 
reduction law, mandate unprecedented across-the-board spending cuts throughout 
the federal bureaucracy. 
Even mail delivery, which relies on commercial night flights, would probably be 
affected. 
Late Friday, Budget Director Richard G. Darman ordered all department heads to 
be prepared to close down their agencies Monday morning if negotiators do not 
reach a budget accord by the Sunday night deadline. He said passage of a 
stopgap spending bill was "unlikely." 
Some essential services or agencies are exempt from the automatic cuts -- 
including salaries for military personnel and benefits under Social Security, 
disability and workers' compensation, Medicaid, food stamps and most other 
welfare programs. 
But, even in those areas, the widespread furloughing of federal employees is 
likely to cause sharp reductions in business hours, delays in processing of 
applications and possibly huge backlogs that could affect government services 
for months. 
There are these examples: 
 -- Some of the most severe effects of the spending cuts would be felt by the 
nation's air traffic control system, where cutbacks in work hours of air 
controllers would force cancellation of about 3,000 scheduled flights a day.
