DRIVER DIES AFTER CROSSING MEDIAN 
A pickup traveling about 75 m.p.h. crossed a freeway median and collided 
head-on with a tractor-trailer truck near Palmdale Wednesday, killing the 
pickup's driver, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
The name of the dead man, a 46-year-old Palmdale resident, was not released 
because relatives had not been notified. The pickup was traveling north on the 
Antelope Valley Freeway when it drifted into the dirt median, became airborne 
and struck the southbound tractor-trailer, Officer Miguel Siordia said. 
The driver of the tractor-trailer, Aydalina Morales, 33, of Los Angeles, was 
treated at Palmdale Hospital Medical Center for minor injuries, Siordia said. 
The crash occurred about 1:50 p.m. near Lake Palmdale, south of Palmdale, 
Siordia said.
