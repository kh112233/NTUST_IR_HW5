does not 

contribute, or 

does 

contribute to 
adverse and beneficial cumulative effects on resources 
and therefore should be excluded from further study or

impacts within the river basin. Documentation should 
include, but not be limited to: how the project(s) 
interact with other projects within the river basin or 
other developmental activities; results from studies; 
resource management policies; and, reports from 
federal, state, and local agencies.

k. Description of Project Action: Central Maine Power Company 
proposes to transfer the license for the Automatic Project 
No. 2555 to the Kennebec Water District. The transfer 
application is the result of the termination of a 1923 
agreement between the transferor and transferee concerning 
project ownership and operation. The purpose of the 
transfer is to facilitate conveyance of all property rights 
in the project from the transferor to the transferee. 

The transfer application was filed within five years of the 
expiration of the license for Project No. 2555, which is the 
subject of a pending relicensing application (which also 
includes project numbers 2556, 2557, and 2559). In 
Hydroelectric Relicensing Regulations Under the Federal 
Power Act (FERC stats. and Regs., Regs. Preambles 19861990 
30,854 at p. 31,437), the Commission declined to forbid 
all license transfers during the last five years of an 
existing license, and instead indicated that it would 
scrutinize all such transfer requests to determine if the 
transfer's primary purpose was to give the transferee an 
advantage in relicensing (

id. 

at p. 31,438 n. 318). The 
transfer would lead to the substitution of the transferee 
for the transferor as the applicant in the relicensing 
proceedings for Project No. 2555 (the transferor would 
remain the applicant for project numbers 2556, 2557, and 
2559).

j. Comment Date: October 31, 1994. 

k. Description of Project: The proposed project would consist 
of: (1) the Likely Range Association's existing 16-foot-
high, 1,100-foot-long earth Moon Lake Dam impounding; (2) 
the 3,000-acre Moon lake reservoir with a storage 
capacity of 35,000 acre-feet with a water surface 
elevation of 5,500 feet msl, to be utilized as the upper 
reservoir; (3) an intake and control structure at the 
dam; (4) an underground tunnel; (5) a powerhouse 
containing four generating units with a total installed 
capacity of 264,000 kW; (6) a 90-foot-high, 650-foot-long 
concrete dam, creating; (6) a 184-acre reservoir with a 
storage capacity of 8,280 acre-feet with a water surface 
elevation of 4,950 feet msl, to be utilized as the lower 
reservoir; (7) a pump station; (8) a 5-mile-long, 230-kV 
transmission line tying into an existing line. 

The project would generate approximately a total of 542,880 MWh of energy annually. 

The applicant estimates the cost of the studies to be 
conducted under the preliminary permit at 337,000. 
No new roads will be needed for the purpose of conducting 
these studies. 

l. Purpose of Project: Project power would be sold to a local utility.
