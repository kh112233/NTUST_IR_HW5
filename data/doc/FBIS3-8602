  [Text] Jan Ruml, Czech minister of the interior has 
returned from his working visit to France. Jiri Bohacek asked 
him what he thought about the dismissal of Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar. 
  [Begin recording] [Ruml] Of late, we have in a way been 
expecting his dismissal. There is one thing I would agree with, 
which is that we need a strong government in Slovakia. It does 
not matter who represents this government. In this case, it was 
Meciar, whose government has been useful for the Czech Republic 
because any destabilization would put our market in Slovakia in 
jeopardy. Naturally, we need a stabilized partner in the East. 
Nevertheless, speaking from the future's point of view, I think 
that Meciar himself and all of his policies were departing from 
being focused on economic reforms and democratization. Speaking 
as a person who has been following the Slovak scene for some 
time, in the long term I regard this as a positive development. 
  [Bohacek] Minister, do you think that the dismissal of 
Slovak 
Prime Minister will be manifested in the problems related to the 
marking of the borders with the Slovak Republic? 
  [Ruml] It will, definitely. The main thing will be that the 
whole task will become more complicated and might even be 
stopped because territorial problems and border-related issues 
are political problems of extreme sensitivity, especially if 
they are made to be sensitive. Thus, in this situation, which 
has come to a head in Slovakia, I cannot imagine that we would 
discuss tiny areas of either Czech or Slovak territory. I think 
it will delay the work a little, but no dramatic changes are 
likely. We will wait and see what the next Slovak Government 
will be like, and we will set the negotiating process 
accordingly. [end recording]
