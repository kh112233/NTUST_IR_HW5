ties with terrorism. 
  [Begin recording] [Minister of Government German Quiroga] 
The 
court investigations are about to be concluded. In keeping with 
what is established in the law, they were able to see their 
relatives on 18 April, 24 hours after their arrest, particularly 
the woman in question. 
  This afternoon the police will be instructed to allow the 
press access to those arrested and tomorrow they will be placed 
at the disposal of the courts. 
  We have established that they were very closely involved in 
the killing of the Mormons, especially the woman. Therefore, we 
are conducting investigations in this direction. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you mean she was more involved 
than Mr. Garcia? 
  [Quiroga] Yes, absolutely. 
  [Reporter] Are they under suspicion for their involvement in 
terrorist activities? 
  [Quiroga] Yes. [end recording] 
  That was Minister of Government German Quiroga, who at 
Government House referred to the arrest of two colleagues.
