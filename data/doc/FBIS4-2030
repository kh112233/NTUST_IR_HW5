<F P=106> ["Provisions for Managing the Collection of Mineral Rights </F>
Fees" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Article 1 These regulations are formulated in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of the "Mineral 
Resources Law of the People's Republic of China" to safeguard 
and promote the prospecting, protection, and rational 
development of mineral resources, and safeguard the state's 
property rights and interests in mineral resources. 
  Article 2 Mineral rights fees [kuang chan zi yuan bu chang 
fei 4349 3934 6327 3293 6316] shall be paid in accordance with 
these regulations for the exploitation of mineral resources 
within the territory of the People's Republic of China and the 
waters under its jurisdiction, unless otherwise provided for by 
laws and administrative regulations. 
  Article 3 Mineral rights fees shall be collected based on a 
fixed percentage of the income from the sale of mineral 
products. Mineral rights fees paid by an enterprise shall be 
listed as operating expenses. 
  Where people with mining rights process mineral products by 
themselves, their income from the sale of mineral products shall 
be calculated based on the price set by the state; where there 
is no set state price for the mineral products, the income from 
the sale of the products shall be calculated based on the 
products' average local market price prevailing at the time of 
the collection of mineral rights fees. 
  Where people with mining rights sell their mineral products 
outside the country, the income from the sale shall be 
calculated based on the products' international market price. 
  The term mineral products used in these regulations refers 
to 
mineral products removed from their natural state through mining 
and dressing. 
  Article 4 Mineral rights fees shall be paid by people with 
mining rights. 
  Mineral rights fees shall be calculated in currency used in 
selling the mineral products; where people with mining rights 
process mineral products by themselves, the mineral rights fees 
shall be calculated in currency used in the sale of the end 
products. 
  Article 5 Mineral rights fees shall be calculated according 
to the following formula: 
  Amount of mineral rights fee equals income from sale of 
mineral products multiplied by the mineral rights fee rate 
multiplies by the coefficient of percentage of recovery 
  Coefficient of percentage of recovery multiplied by 
appraised 
percentage of recovery/actual percentage of recovery 
  Appraised percentage of recovery is based on the blueprint 
of 
the mine approved in accordance with relevant state regulations; 
where a mining enterprise is required to prepare only a mining 
plan instead of a blueprint, the percentage of recovery shall be 
determined by the department in charge of geology and mineral 
resources management under the local people's government at and 
above the county level together with other relevant departments. 
  Where mineral rights fees for certain minerals cannot be 
calculated in accordance with the provisions of the first and 
second paragraphs of this article, the department in charge of 
geology and mineral resources under the State Council shall 
develop separate formulas together with the State Council's 
finance department. 
  Article 6 Mineral rights fees shall be collected in 
accordance with the rates provided for in the appendix of these 
regulations. 
  Adjustment of mineral rights fees shall be made jointly by 
the State Council finance department and the State Council 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources and shall 
be implemented after it is submitted to and approved by the 
State Council. 
  Article 7 Mineral rights fees shall be collected jointly by 
the department in charge of geology and mineral resources and 
the finance department. 
  Where a mine is located in an administrative district at the 
county level, mineral rights fees shall be collected by the 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources under the 
people's government of the county where the mines are located. 
  Where the area of a mine extends beyond an administrative 
district above the county level, mineral rights fees shall be 
collected by the department in charge of geology and mineral 
resources of the people's government at the next higher level. 
  Where the area of a mine extends beyond an administrative 
district at the provincial level or is in the territorial waters 
of the People's Republic of China or waters under its 
jurisdiction, mineral rights fees shall be collected by the 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources of the 
provincial people's government authorized by the State Council 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources. 
  Article 8 People with mining rights shall pay mineral 
rights fees for the first half of the year by 31 July annually; 
and pay such fees for the second half by 31 January of the next 
year. 
  People with mining rights shall pay off their mineral rights 
fees when suspending or terminating mining. 
  Article 9 While paying mineral rights fees, people with 
mining rights shall also submit such information on varieties, 
output, sales volume, sales prices, and actual mining recovery 
ratio of the extracted mineral products. 
  Article 10 Collected mineral rights fees shall be turned 
over in full to the locality's state treasury immediately. At 
the end of the year, the account of the aforementioned fees 
shall be settled independently, in accordance with the ratios of 
fees between the central authorities and provinces, autonomous 
regions, or municipalities as described in the following 
sentence: 
  The ratio of mineral rights fees between the central 
authorities and provinces or municipalities is 5:5; and the 
ratio between the central authorities and autonomous regions is 
4:6. 
  Article 11 Mineral rights fees are included in the state 
budget and handled as a special account; and will be used mainly 
in exploring mineral resources. 
  The specific measures for using and managing mineral rights 
fees obtained by the central authorities are worked out jointly 
by the State Council departments in charge of finance, geology 
and mineral resources, and planning. 
  The specific measures for using and managing mineral rights 
fees obtained by localities are worked out by the provincial, 
autonomous regional, and municipal people's governments. 
  Article 12 With joint approval of the department in charge 
of geology and mineral resources under the provincial-level 
people's government and financial department at the same level, 
people with mining rights may be exempt from paying mineral 
rights fees if they meet one of the following: 
  (1) Recovering mineral products from waste rock; 
  (2) Extracting, with approval, the leftover ore body without 
safety protection from a closed mine, according to the state's 
relevant regulations; 
  (3) Other conditions recognized by the State Council's 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources and the 
financial department for fee exemptions. 
  Article 13 With joint approval of the department in charge 
of geology and mineral resources under the provincial-level 
people's government and financial department at the same level, 
people with mining rights may pay a smaller amount of mineral 
rights fees if they meet one of the following: 
  (1) Recovering mineral products from tailings; 
  (2) Extracting low-graded mineral resources that fail to 
reach the grade of industrial products or are of uncalculated 
reserves; 
  (3) Extracting mineral resources under a body of water, 
buildings, and vital communication lines; 
  (4) Incurring losses permitted by policy, as a result of 
implementing state-fixed prices; 
  (5) Other conditions recognized by the State Council's 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources and the 
financial department for reductions. 
  Provided that a reduction is over 50 percent of the payable 
mineral rights fees, it shall be approved by the people's 
governments at provincial level. 
  When reduction cases are approved, they shall be reported to 
the State Council's department in charge of geology and mineral 
resources and the financial department for the record. 
  Article 14 If the mine operator has not paid mineral 
rights fees within the time limit, the levying organization 
shall instruct the operator to pay the amount within a 
prescribed period plus 2 percent of the fees per day as a fine 
for delaying payment, starting the day after the time limit 
expires. 
  If the mine operator does not pay mineral rights fees and 
fines for delaying payment according to the stipulation in the 
above paragraph, the levying organization shall impose a fine of 
less than three times the amount of mineral resource 
compensation fees. In serious cases, the organization having 
the authority to issue mining permits shall withdraw the mine 
operator's permit. 
  Article 15 If the mine operator falsely reports types of 
minerals for mining, hides the mineral output, and conceals the 
quantities of mineral sales; if the operator makes a false 
report on sales prices and actual rate of recovery in mining 
operations; or if the operator refuses to pay or pays inadequate 
mineral rights fees, the levying organization shall instruct the 
operator to pay the due mineral rights fees plus a fine of less 
than five times the amount of mineral resource compensation 
fees. In serious cases, the organization having the authority 
to issue mining permits shall withdraw the mine operator's 
permit. 
  Article 16 If the mine operator does not report related 
information in accordance with the stipulations of Article 9 of 
these regulations, the levying organization shall instruct the 
mine operator to submit the report within a certain time limit. 
If the operator does not do so, a fine of less than 5,000 yuan 
shall be levied. If the operator still does not submit the 
related report, the organization having the authority to issue 
mining permits shall withdraw the mine operator's permit. 
  Article 17 The fines and money collected for delaying 
payments according to these regulations shall be delivered to 
the state treasury.

decision on administrative punishment, the concerned party may 
appeal to a higher organization within 15 days after receiving 
notice of punishment. The concerned party may also directly 
request the people's court to try the case within 15 days after 
receiving the notice of punishment. 
  If the concerned party does not ask for reconsideration and 
does not request the people's court to try the case within the 
time limit but refuses to accept punishment, the organization 
which makes the punishment decisions may request the people's 
court to forcibly exercise punishment. 
  Article 19 If local laws and regulations, the rules 
promulgated by the local people's government and contents of 
administrative documents promulgated earlier run counter to 
these regulations, the stipulations of these regulations shall 
be applied. 
  Article 20 Various provincial, autonomous regional, and 
municipal people's governments may formulate procedures for 
implementing these regulations. 
  Article 21 The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources 
shall be responsible for the explanation of these regulations.
