FT  18 APR 94 / Record seizure of forged notes
Police yesterday seized a record haul of counterfeit notes with a face value
of tens of millions of pounds in at least six different currencies, John
Authers writes.
Officers from the South East Regional Crime Squad raided a property in
Islington, north London, yesterday morning and discovered 'three people in
the process of producing between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m in sterling notes'.
Police said the find would probably prove to be the largest counterfeiting
operation discovered in the UK. Searches of the property, said to contain 'a
complete printing works' and of the home addresses of four men arrested on
the scene had revealed notes worth 'tens of millions of pounds'.
Plates and negatives for Pounds 50, Pounds 20 and Pounds 10 notes were
seized and the police also found sheets of Romanian, Spanish, Irish and
Nigerian currency as well as plates and negatives for Dollars 50 bills.
