<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Dirk </F>
Hoeren; place and date not given: "Mr. Minister, What Are Other 
Countries Now Thinking About Us?"] 
  [Text] [Hoeren] What are the effects that the [arson] 
attack on the synagogue [in Luebeck] has on the Germans' image 
in the world? 
  [Kinkel] The arson attack on the synagogue in Luebeck hurts 
Germany's reputation. We must relentlessly persecute and 
prosecute the perpetrators of this abominable deed and thus make 
it clear that we are a rule-of-law state, that we reject such 
individual deeds, which cannot be justified in any way -- and 
that we have learned from history. 
  [Hoeren] In other countries fear of Germany is growing. Are 
the concerns justified? 
  [Kinkel] Unfortunately, these terrible attacks always give 
the impression to public opinion abroad that there is a broad 
right-wing extremist and anti-Semitic movement in the FRG. Of 
course, this gives rise to concern. It is our task to put 
things into the proper perspective. The other countries must 
know: These are evil individual acts, for which we are 
ashamed.... 
  [Hoeren] What are the effects of these right-wing extremist 
attacks? 
  [Kinkel] Moelln, Solingen, and Sachsenhausen have not yet 
been forgotten in the world. I see this in many talks with 
foreign politicians. My interlocutors mostly know that these 
are individual incidents. 
  However, the media abroad often present a different picture. 
Therefore, it is so important that we Germans give clear signs 
against xenophobia with, for instance, chains of lights, 
demonstrations, and friendliness toward foreigners. Xenophobia 
must be nipped in the bud. Never again must hatred of 
foreigners, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism emanate from Germany.
