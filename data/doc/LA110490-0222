READERS REACT: TAKING ISSUE WITH TIMES' STANDS; 
NOTE: MANY LETTERS WRITERS SUPPORT OUR VIEWS; MANY DO NOT. IN THE SPIRIT OF 
VIGOROUS DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES, HERE IS A SELECTION OF LETTERS THAT 
DISAGREES WITH US.; 
TERM LIMITS: PROPS. 131, 140 
I have read "let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater" a great number of 
times in regard to Prop. 140. 
My response to this is "we can make more babies." After the limited number of 
years as a "lawmaker," the legislator would have the simple choice of either 
running for higher office or returning to the private sector and living under 
the laws he created. Think about it.
