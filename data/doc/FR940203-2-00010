SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The subject permit is requested under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C.
1361 

et seq.

), the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), and the regulations governing the taking, importing, and exporting of endangered fish and wildlife (50 CFR part
222).


This permit application is to incidentally harass marine mammals and sea turtles by a low frequency (6080 Hz)
sound source which will be located due west of Pt. Sur, California, at 850950m depth. This sound source is part
of the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) Program, and will be operated from approximately April 1, 1994,
through March 31, 1996, with a maximum duty cycle of 8%, to conduct research on the effects of this source on marine mammals.
The transmission bandwidth is approximately 20 Hz with a level of 195 dB (re: 1 uPa at 1m) and the spectrum level for the
peak frequency (70 Hz) is 182 dB (re: 1 uPa at 1m). The effects of these transmissions on marine mammals and sea turtles
will be monitored through passive acoustic tracking, satellite and recoverable tagging of ``indicator'' species,
and visual surveys and observations.
