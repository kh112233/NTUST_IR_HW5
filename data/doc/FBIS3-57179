  [Text] As Interfax learned from well-informed sources, 
Russia's Foreign Ministry may send a note to Tokyo in connection 
with the recent violation of Russia's territorial waters in the 
area of the South Kurils by Japanese ships. 
  "To write and despatch a note will not take a long time, but 
we do not want to be hasty: the document should be impeccable 
from the point of view of the facts," a senior Foreign Ministry 
official told Interfax. "According to some information, 50 
Japanese ships entered Russian territorial waters. This gives 
rise to the following question: Was it a "demonstration," and 
why were the ships driven out of our territorial waters, instead 
of being detained by Russian frontier guards?" 
  Russia has no intention of staging a confrontation, the 
diplomat pointed out. "That is why we want to obtain an 
objective and full picture of what happened," he said. 
  According to the official, the "incident" will undoubtedly 
be 
discussed, among other things, at the Russian-Japanese 
consultations to be held in Moscow in mid-February between the 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Alexander Panov, and his 
Japanese counterpart, Hiroshi Fukuda. "It has been mutually 
agreed that the exact date of these consultations will be 
announced in Moscow and Tokyo on Tuesday, January 25," he noted.
