FT  27 JUL 92 / Letter: Disputing an age-old fallacy
Sir, Sir Sigmund Sternberg (Letters, July 15) belongs to an enlightened
minority. Unfortunately, many UK employers have yet to recognise that, in
Sir Sigmund's words, 'age need not be a barrier to success'. Instead, they
operate 'too old at X policies' - X being almost any random number over 22.
There is research evidence supporting the 'too old at' paradigm, just as
there is research evidence that the earth is flat and that this planet is
the centre of the universe. But the evidence is flawed. In fact, older
adults can be as successful as their juniors, and they can be just as
creative.
Some of the evidence is set out in my recent article, 'Creativity and older
adults' (Leadership and Organization Development Journal 13/2). There are a
few caveats, but the general position is that, if he wants to be, the
90-year-old can be as mentally alert as the 19-year-old, provided he has
resisted flat-earthers' efforts to brain-shrink him into behaving in the
self-restricting and self-degrading ways which match their negative
paradigm.
