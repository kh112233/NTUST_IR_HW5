FT  04 NOV 93 / Observer: Lucky Jacques
Napoleon's ghost must be smiling on the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development's choice of Jacques de Larosiere to succeed Jacques Attali as
its president.
After all, Bonaparte's main criterion for choosing generals was that they
must be lucky, and, unlike his predecessor, the new president looks to be
fortunate even in his misfortunes.
Witness the effect on the media of his recent arrival at the IMF annual
meeting in an ordinary Washington DC taxicab. The press applauded it as an
admirable contrast with Attali's love of limousines and private jets.
Alas, it now transpires that the cab journey was not a deliberate symbol of
the dawning of a new age of austerity at the bank. The IMF had in fact laid
on a limo to collect de Larosiere at Dulles airport, but the chauffeur
failed to recognise the former Banque de France governor and drove away
without him.
Privately, he was not amused.
