  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 03, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar, speaking at the opening of a meeting of the country's 
farm sector representatives, said reform in the agriculture was 
lagging behind and that losing time on making only minor 
improvements was now having its effect on the rural life. 
  The prime minister said protracting was evident in carrying 
out reforms in farming. "This has cost much to Estonia. It is 
the time lost that poses the greatest problem to us," he said. 
  Laar in his speech said farmers should not count on a quick 
way to prosperity, as it would take more than a year or two to 
make up for what has been done to the country's traditional 
agricultural economy during 50 years of Communist rule. 
  The prime minister said that his Cabinet when coming to 
power 
in 1992 had chosen the path of continuing the reform on the 
basis of the already existing laws, also trying to improve some 
of the latter "en route." 
  Laar said the government expected from the congress 
proposals 
on ways to help develop the rural sector, but he also warned 
that populist measures would lead both Estonia as a country, as 
well as its rural life to a disaster.
