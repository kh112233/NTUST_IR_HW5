  [Text] Officials announced yesterday that 275 police 
officers were killed and more than 8,120 sustained injuries on 
duty last year. 
  This testified to the heroism of the public security forces 
which safeguard people's lives and economic progress, Public 
Security Minister Tao Siju said. 
  Currently, China's police force has about one million 
officers. 
  More than 1,400 on duty police officers were killed and 
nearly 40,000 others received injuries since 1988, the minister 
said. 
  Analysts say that Chinese police now face more risks because 
criminals have started to arm themselves with weapons to resist 
police arrests, giving rise to armed clashes and casualties. 
  Statistics from the Public Security Ministry show that 
during 
the first 11 months last year, cases of armed violence rose 52.6 
per cent over the same period in 1992. 
  Police handled more than 1.5 million criminal cases and 
arrested more than 1 million offenders for all 1993. 
  They also helped combat 146 major fires that burnt 
factories, 
commercial buildings, entertainment centres and oil storage 
tanks in Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai and other cities. 
  Tao spoke at the third-annual ceremony held by his ministry 
yesterday honouring the nation's 100 best public security 
bureaus and 1,000 outstanding police officers. 
  It hopes to encourage Chinese police to further safeguard 
lives and promote economic progress, reforms and opening-up. 
  While praising these branch bureaus and policemen for their 
achievements, Tao also outlined four major tasks facing police 
this year: protecting political and social stability, severely 
cracking down on criminal offenders, wiping out social evils and 
expanding police teams. 
  At the ceremony, the honoured branch bureaus and policemen 
received cash awards in addition to written citations. 
  Each of the 100 best bureaus was awarded 10,000 yuan 
($1,150). While 22 of them, those receiving the honour for the 
third time, received 20,000 yuan ($2,300) each.
