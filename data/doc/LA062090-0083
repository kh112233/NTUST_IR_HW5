BANK MUST OPEN VAULT IN HUNT FOR STOLEN ART 
A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a small-town bank allegedly holding a cache 
of stolen medieval art to open its vault to an inventory by the East German 
cathedral that claims the treasure. 
U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater ordered also that the time and place of 
the inspection be kept secret to protect the inspectors and the objects. The 
works are believed to have been hidden in a German mine shaft and taken by a 
U.S. soldier from Texas at the end of World War II.
