  [Text] Bonn -- According to Interior Minister Manfred 
Kanther (Christian Democratic Union), the majority of the Kurds 
who were actively involved in the weekend rioting [19-20 March] 
may be deported to Turkey. Mere membership in the Kurdish 
ethnic group does not mean that those affected face human rights 
violations or the death penalty in their home country, Kanther 
told journalists in Bonn on Monday. This alone would provide a 
reason for refraining from a deportation. Possible arrest in 
Turkey is no such reason. 
  Harald Thiemann, chairman of the German Police Trade Union, 
demanded negotiations between Germany and Turkey aimed at 
preventing the death sentence for criminals deported from 
Germany. German citizens and policemen can no longer accept the 
fact that "a war is being waged" by extremists "on the backs of 
German police officers" under the protection of the Human Rights 
Convention, Thiemann stressed today. Dozens of policemen were 
injured during the weekend rioting. The authorities have 
initiated over 500 legal investigations against demonstrators. 
  Kanther once more called emphatically on the courts and 
foreign authorities to fully apply the penal code to those who 
committed crimes and to make "massive" use of the existing 
possibilities for deportation. Only a minority of the Kurds 
involved in the riots actually faced political persecution in 
their home country and have been recognized as political 
refugees. As far as "normal" supporters of the Kurdish Workers 
Party [PKK] are concerned, it should not be a problem to deport 
them, Kanther pointed out. 
  The interior minister defended the ban on the PKK in 
Germany. 
Nobody assumed that the activities of the party and its 
subdivisions could be stopped immediately. Yet the measure 
should make it clear that Germany is no resting place for the 
PKK. However, more violent incidents cannot be ruled out 
completely.
