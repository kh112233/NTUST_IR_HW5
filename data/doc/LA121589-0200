SHORT TAKES; 
PARAMOUNT VICTIMIZED BUCHWALD ON 'AMERICA' SCRIPT, JUDGE TOLD 
An attorney for columnist Art Buchwald denounced Paramount Pictures today as an 
unscrupulous movie studio that victimized Buchwald by stealing his script idea 
and turning it into the hit movie "Coming to America." 
"We seek substantial punitive damages to teach Paramount and others like it a 
lesson not to treat creative people like this ever again," attorney Pierce 
O'Donnell said. 
In his opening statement, the lawyer told Superior Court Judge Harvey 
Schneider, who will hear the case without a jury, that he will prove that 
Paramount took Buchwald's script idea entitled "King For A Day" and transformed 
it into the 1988 Eddie Murphy comedy, which grossed more than $150 million. The 
suit seeks $5 million in damages. 
Murphy, the attorney said, has already netted $22 million from the film and 
Paramount collected more than $50 million in distribution fees. But, he said, 
the studio refused to pay Buchwald and producer Alain Bernheim $250,000 plus a 
small share of profits under their original contract. 
An attorney for Paramount, Robert Draper, ridiculed the idea that Buchwald's 
script idea was plagiarized. Draper acknowledged that during the year in which 
the case was pending, Murphy -- who is not a party in the suit -- admitted that 
he had seen Buchwald's proposal. But Murphy said he could not tell whether it 
influenced him subconsciously in writing his own script for "Coming to 
America." 
Personalities such as Buchwald, Murphy, director John Landis and Murphy's 
co-star Arsenio Hall are expected to testify in the two-week trial.
