FT  12 AUG 94 / Mayhew to look at objections to Hualon
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday said he would
examine objections from leading British industrialists to a move by Hualon,
the Taiwanese group, to build a textiles factory in Belfast.
In a meeting with Mr Nicholas Winterton, Tory MP and chairman of the
Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance, and other textile
industry chiefs, Sir Patrick said that he would 'give full consideration' to
claims that the Hualon project could lead to substantial losses in the
textile industry on the mainland.
He would not, however, commit the government to reviewing its decision to
give Pounds 61m in aid to the Taiwanese company to build its plant.
Sir Patrick also pointed out that the potential for job displacement had
already been taken into account by ministers, and that state support for
Hualon had been ap-proved by the European Commission.
Textile manufacturers say that the Hualon project would lead to job losses
because of existing overproduction of textiles in Europe.
Although Hualon could employ more than 1,300 people, the project has been
described as a 'Trojan horse' which could give the south-east Asian textile
industry a foothold in Europe.
Mr Winterton emphasised at yesterday's meeting that existing textile
companies in Northern Ireland risked losing jobs if the project went ahead.
He also claimed that one Northern Ireland company feared it could be
'deskilled' as a result of Hualon taking its trained operatives.
The Northern Ireland Office restated yesterday that there was scope for
Hualon to sell products to mainland Europe and the US, and to substitute
products which are now imported to Britain from south-east Asia.
