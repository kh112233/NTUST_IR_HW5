  [Text] Sources in 'Arafat's police have said that the 
[Palestinian] policeman killed last night at a joint checkpoint 
manned by 'Arafat's police and Zionist troops was Khalil 
Abu-Hamzah. The incident occurred when he arrived to take up his 
position at the joint checkpoint on the Netzarim-al-Munthar 
road. Three gunshots were immediately fired at him from a 
nearby farm. One gunshot hit him in the right side of the 
chest. The source asserted that the shooting was deliberate. 
  Our correspondents say that the perpetrators of this 
operation were probably Mosad men and their agents or a group of 
settlers. 
  The Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine has issued a 
statement accusing the settlers of killing policeman Abu-Hamzah. 
The statement said this criminal incident stresses that the 
Zionists harbor only malice and racism against the Palestinian 
people and all Arabs and Muslims. The life of a Palestinian is 
targeted just because he is a Palestinian, whether he is a 
policeman who is asked to protect the Gaza-Jericho agreement--an 
agreement that guarantees the security of both the Zionist 
entity and settlements--or the mujahidin who protect our people 
from malice, racism, and occupation. 
  In its statement, the Movement condemned this criminal 
incident, and emphasized that it will escalate its militant 
activities against the Zionists.
