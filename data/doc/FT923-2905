FT  15 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US lifts Russian aid
THE US yesterday brushed off concerns of Russian credit-worthiness and
extended Moscow Dollars 1.15bn in loan guarantees and aid for food purchases
through February.
The Agriculture Department, which has been providing generously for American
farmers as well in the run up to the November elections, yesterday said
Dollars 600m in credit guarantees would be made available to Moscow in the
next 3 1/2 months for grain and livestock feed with Dollars 300m extended in
January and February.
Another Dollars 250m in food aid for the purchase of processed or higher
value products will complete the package. This brings total US food credits
assistance to Moscow to Dollars 5.75bn since January 1991.
Canada last month suspended grain shipments to Russia when it ran more than
Dollars 80m behind in servicing its Dollars 1.5bn line of credit. That,
however, now has apparently been resolved.
