  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has registered a 
strong protest to the Togolese charge d'affaires in Ghana 
against the reported abduction by Togolese naval officers of 
seven Ghanaian fishermen who were on a fishing expedition at 
Aflaho, in Ghana's territorial waters. An official statement 
issued in Accra by the ministry said Ghana is demanding the 
immediate release of the fishermen and warned that it will hold 
the Togolese Government responsible for the safety of the 
abducted fishermen. 
  The ministry has, at the same time, requested Ghana's charge 
d'affaires in Togo to pursue the matter vigorously with the 
Togolese authorities and report back urgently.
