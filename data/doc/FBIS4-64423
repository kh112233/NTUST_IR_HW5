  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Tuesday [3 May] FRG Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel congratulated Nelson Mandela as the future 
South African president on the "crowning of your lifelong 
political work." Kinkel will fly to Pretoria for the 
inauguration next Tuesday. 
  Kinkel expressed his respect and appreciation for outgoing 
President Frederik de Klerk. It is not surprising that the 
elections did "not" take place "without some organizational 
problems." The important thing is the impression gained by the 
international observers that the elections were "generally free 
and fair." The new South Africa can count on German solidarity 
and "energetic support." 
  The Social Democratic Party Executive Committee also 
expressed appreciation for De Klerk and congratulations to 
Mandela. In a statement published on Tuesday the Executive 
Committee stressed the trust placed in Mandela, who will take 
away fear and concern from the South Africans of different 
colors by implementing the announced policy of reconciliation. 
German industry, which worked also during the UN sanctions in 
South Africa, is now particularly called upon to help.
