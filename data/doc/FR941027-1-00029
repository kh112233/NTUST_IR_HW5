Development of Permit Regulations for Polar Bear Trophy Importation Under the 1994 Amendments to the Marine Mammal
Protection Act 



<AGENCY>

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

ACTION:

 Notice of intent.


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On April 30, 1994, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (Act) was amended to allow the issuance of permits to import sport-hunted
trophies of polar bears (

Ursus maritimus

) (excluding internal organs) legally taken by the applicant while hunting in Canada, provided certain findings
have been made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). These permits may also authorize the importation of
polar bears taken, but not imported, prior to enactment of the Amendments, provided certain conditions are met. The
Service has received a number of inquiries concerning the importation of polar bear trophies. This notice provides
information on the steps the Service is taking to implement this new provision of the Act and the anticipated timeframes.
The Service is working concurrently on developing permit regulations and gathering data to make the legal and scientific
findings required under section 104(c)(5)(A) of the Act. Applications for the import of sport-hunted polar bear
trophies will not be accepted until the completion of the permit rulemaking process early in 1995. The Service will
be able to act on applications once it has resolved several outstanding questions and is able to make the required scientific
findings, in consultation with the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC), and after notice and opportunity for public comment.
In the meantime, a list of interested parties has been established to receive all relevant information as the process
proceeds.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The Service anticipates publishing a proposed rule of permit requirements and procedures to import polar bear trophies
by November 1994 for public review and comment. A decision on the proposal is expected to be published in early 1995.
A notice of proposed rulemaking on the scientific findings will be published soon thereafter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Prior to enactment of amendments to the Act in 1994, those seeking authority to import polar bear trophies from Canada
were required to obtain a waiver of the Act's moratorium on taking and importing marine mammals. The 1994 Amendments
included a streamlined procedure for authorizing such imports by permit. Section 104(c)(5) of the Act sets out a permitting
process, as well as the specific findings that must be made before permits can be issued to import these trophies into
the United States. The Service is developing proposed regulations that will outline the permit application requirements,
procedures, issuance criteria, and fee. The law requires the Service to establish and charge a reasonable fee for
issuing polar bear trophy import permits. As specified in the Amendments, all fees would be used for polar bear conservation
programs being conducted in Alaska and Russia. The Service anticipates publishing a proposed rule promptly so, after
a review of all available data and public comments, a decision can be published as early as possible in calendar year
1995. 



The Service is unable to accept applications for the import of sport-hunted polar bear trophies until the permit rulemaking
process is complete in early 1995. Once the Service has received comments on the application requirements under the
proposed rule, an application form will be developed and submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for approval
under the Paperwork Reduction Act. 

At the same time that the permit rulemaking process is occurring, the Service is working with the Canadian wildlife
authorities to obtain information necessary to make the findings required by section 104(c)(5)(A) of the Act. Prior
to issuing a permit, the Service must find that (1) the applicant has provided the necessary documentation to show
that the polar bear was legally harvested in Canada by the applicant; (2) Canada has a monitored and enforced sport-hunting
program consistent with the purposes of the 1971 International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears; (3)
Canada's sport-hunting program is based on scientifically sound quotas ensuring the maintenance of the affected
population stock at a sustainable level; (4) the export and subsequent import are consistent with the provisions
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and other international agreements and conventions;
and (5) the export and subsequent import are not likely to contribute to illegal trade in bear parts. 

The Service is to make these findings after notice and opportunity for public comment and in consultation with the
MMC, an independent Federal agency with statutory authority to make recommendations pursuant to Title II of the Act.
Several questions have come to the attention of the Service. A contract report prepared for the MMC in 1993 has questioned
whether Canada's sport-hunting program is fully consistent with Article III of the Agreement. In addition, the Amendments
require the Service to make the determination of sustainability of hunting quotas at the population level, but Canada
manages polar bears at the subpopulation level. The Service is currently pursuing the resolution of these and related
questions concerning its ability to make the required findings. Once these questions have been resolved and the Service
is able to make the findings outlined above, it will be able to act on applications. The Service seeks information regarding
each of these five findings. 

While conducting these activities, the Service will need to evaluate its actions under the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA), as appropriate. 

By April 30, 1996, the Service is to undertake a scientific review of the impact of permits issued on the Canadian polar
bear population stocks. An opportunity for public comment will be part of this review, with the responses included
in the final report. Permit issuance can continue after September 30, 1996, only if the Service determines, based
on scientific review, that the issuance of permits is not having a significant adverse impact on the polar bear populations
stocks in Canada.
