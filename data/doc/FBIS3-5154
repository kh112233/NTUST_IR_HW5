  [Text] Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said 
the British media made all sorts of false allegations against 
the Malaysian leadership because it wanted to undermine 
Malaysia's credibility in its efforts to solve world problems. 
They hoped that by giving a bad impression of the country's 
leadership, Malaysia's voice in the international arena would no 
longer be respected. 
  The prime minister said he could not determine their 
intention, but the fact that the attacks mounted by the 
newspapers against Malaysia and its leadership could have the 
effect of reducing people's trust against Malaysia. [sentence as 
heard] He said this after attending a dialogue session with 
federal officials in Kota Baharu, the capital of the east coast 
state of Kelantan. 
  Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said that Malaysia must be 
economically strong to prevent the country from being indirectly 
colonized by big powers. He points out that though the country 
has achieved considerable progress since independence, it is 
still far away from the target set for Vision 2020. As such, 
all sectors must do their best to ensure political stability so 
that the country can continue to march forward for greater 
achievements. He said Malaysia is fortunate that it can now 
survive without aid from others.
