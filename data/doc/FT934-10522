FT  05 NOV 93 / Kurds 'launch attacks across Europe'
SUSPECTED Kurdish separatists launched a wave of attacks across Europe
yesterday, killing one man in Germany and causing damage to embassies,
airline offices and commercial property in London, Copenhagen, Switzerland
and Vienna.
The PKK, the banned Kurdish Workers' Party, did not claim responsibility for
the precisely co-ordinated sledgehammer and firebomb attacks, but police had
little doubt that Kurdish separatists had carried them out.
It was the second campaign of simultaneous attacks in four months. In June,
Kurdish militants attacked Turkish diplomatic missions, numerous travel
agencies and banks in several European cities.
A document left at the Turkish embassy in London - one of four Turkish
premises firebombed - said the attacks were a protest against Turkish
treatment of Kurdistan and the 'massacre in the town of Lice on October 22'.
Turkish troops shelled the town after a gendarme general was shot.
The attackers said they would resist the efforts of Mr Demirel, the Turkish
president, to 'finish off Kurdish resistance by spring 1996.'
Germany, which has a large Kurdish population, was singled out for the most
concerted attacks, with authorities in 28 cities reporting incidents of
varying severity.
One attack on a restaurant in Wiesbaden killed one diner and injured eight
more. In another, 20 armed men ransacked the European headquarters of the
Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, in Frankfurt hitting a guard with sledgehammers
and beating a journalist.
In Oslo, a small group of Kurds demonstrated peacefully outside the Turkish
embassy.
Five people were taken to hospital after the four firebomb attacks in
London. Up to 1,000 people were evacuated in an attack on a Turkish bank in
the City of London.
