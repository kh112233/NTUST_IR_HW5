  [Excerpts] Major Santiago Fundora, National Air Service 
(SAN) director, pointed out yesterday that drug traffickers are 
looking for new routes to conduct their drug activity in the 
national territory. He also confirmed the existence of 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] guerrillas in the 
border region with Darien. [passage omitted] 
  Fundora confirmed the presence of FARC guerrillas in the 
Darien territory, and he stressed that more vigilance in this 
zone is needed because of the FARC presence. Fundora added that 
the National Government must increase the number of Border 
Police units and it must supply them with better equipment to 
conduct their work. 
  The government must make efforts to combat piracy on the 
seas, drug trafficking activities, and crime in the capital, 
Fundora noted. He added that the ghost of militarism should 
disappear and that members of the National Police should be 
properly equipped to perform their duties more effectively.
