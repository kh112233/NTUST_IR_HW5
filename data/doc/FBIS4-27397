  [Text] In Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and some other 
localities, there have been many cases recently in which 
foreigners used counterfeit U.S. dollars in selling and 
purchasing transactions, and some buyers have been given 
counterfeit U.S. dollars. 
  The Interior Ministry has directed its related departments 
to 
coordinate with local police forces and other agencies to work 
out approriate plans to prevent and discover sources of 
counterfeit dollars in Vietnam. 
  In early March 1994, security forces received information on 
a large amount of counterfeit dollars circulating in the Hanoi 
area. The security forces joined efforts with local police in 
Lang Son to investigate all sources and suspects. After a month 
of investigation, the security forces discovered the culprit and 
confiscated 100,000 counterfeit U.S dollars in $100 bills. 
  The case has been transferred to relevant agency for 
prosecution.
