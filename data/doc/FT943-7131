FT  25 AUG 94 / N Sea platforms to use wind power
Amoco, the US oil company, is spending Pounds 200,000 on installing
wind-powered generators for equipment on its unmanned Davy and Bessemer
natural gas platforms in the North Sea off the East Anglian coast. The
bigger, manned platforms are unsuitable candidates because of their large
power requirements, which can be the equivalent of a town of 30,000 people.
The company expects to reap financial and environmental benefits. It
forecasts an 85 per cent reduction in spending on diesel, the fuel normally
used to power generators on unmanned platforms, and a 75 per cent cut in
hydrocarbon exhausts.
