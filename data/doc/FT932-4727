FT  08 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Retrial in Dollars 1bn treasure case -
Legal Briefs
The three-year battle in the US courts over the treasure of the SS Central
America, which sank in 1857 180 miles off the South Carolina coast with
Dollars 2m in Californian gold on board, is about to reach its climax
following a refusal by the US Supreme Court to hear an appeal by the
explorers, Columbus-America Discovery Group, who found the ship in 1987.
At the end of June, the US District Court in Norfolk, Virginia, will retry
the case to determine the salvage award due to the explorers. Opposing them
are 39 insurance companies awarded ownership of the wreck on the basis that
they paid for the original loss - despite not producing policies or evidence
of claims of payment and not searching for the ship for 135 years. The
treasure is now worth about Dollars 1bn.
