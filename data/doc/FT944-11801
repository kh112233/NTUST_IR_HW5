FT  04 NOV 94 / Part-time workers win cash deal
Six airline stewardesses employed by British Midland Airlines who claimed to
have been made redundant because they worked part-time have won a
substantial settlement from the company, Robert Taylor writes.
This promises to be a landmark in the legal treatment of part-time workers
following the Lords judgment in March that they should enjoy the same access
to protection from unfair dismissal and redundancy as full-time employees.
The actual terms of the agreement have not been revealed because they are
subject to a High Court injunction issued against the Equal Opportunities
Commission, which represented the women.
The commission said it welcomed the financial settlement and looked forward
to working with British Midland on the implementation of a revised
equal-opportunities policy.
