FDA TO BAN SULFITES ON POTATOES, CITES 4 ALLERGY-RELATED DEATHS 
The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday it will extend a ban on the use 
of sulfites to include fresh potatoes because of severe allergic reactions to 
the preservative, including four deaths. 
The FDA banned use of sulfites on fruit and produce on salad bars in 1986, but 
potatoes were excluded from the ban. 
After strong industry lobbying, the FDA decided to study further whether the 
ban should extend to potatoes. 
An industry spokesman said the ban would have little impact on consumers but 
would hurt many businesses that prepare potatoes for use in restaurants. 
The agency said it has received nearly 1,000 complaints of adverse reactions to 
sulfites since 1985. 
Most of the reported reactions were mild, including dizziness, cramps or 
wheezing. But, occasionally, reactions can cause breathing difficulty that can 
lead to death. 
Four deaths have been reported after consumption of sulfite-treated potatoes, 
the FDA said. 
Up to a million asthmatics may be sensitive to sulfites, the agency said. 
The new ban, published in Thursday's Federal Register, will go into effect in 
30 days. 
Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public Interest applauded 
the ban on sulfite-treated potatoes, saying it was "long overdue and indicative 
of a new outlook on these types of problems" by the federal government. 
Sulfites are used on peeled potatoes to keep them white and firm. The 
preservative usually is added after potatoes are cut up for distribution to 
fast food and other restaurants.
