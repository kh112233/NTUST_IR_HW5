  [Text] Emmerich (DPA) -- After a check on the highway near 
Emmerich, customs officials on Friday discovered some 85 kg of 
hashish with a street value of 1 million German marks. This is 
the largest quantity of hashish seized in the German-Netherlands 
border region to date, the supreme fiscal authority of 
Duesseldorf stated. The border officials became suspicious 
because the driver did not heed a signal disc. The suspicion 
was confirmed by a tracker dog who began to wag his tail. In a 
skillfully welded hiding place beneath the boot, the dog smelled 
out the drugs. The two students from Berlin, aged 20 and 21, 
claimed not to know anything about the drugs--and were arrested.
