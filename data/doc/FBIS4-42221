  [Excerpt] Frankfurt/Main -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(FDP) [Free Democratic Party] referred to the devastating 
effects abroad of the right-wing radical excesses in Germany. 
Speaking at the FDP's Research and Scientific Congress entitled 
"Is Germany Sleeping Through Its Own Future?," Kinkel said: 
"Germany has not yet realized what damage these occurrences are 
causing us abroad. Germany is no longer first choice among 
foreign students. Out of 800 Turkish students who had won 
scholarships, 770 have chosen to study either in the United 
States or Great Britain. Only 12 have chosen a German 
university," said Kinkel. [passage omitted]
