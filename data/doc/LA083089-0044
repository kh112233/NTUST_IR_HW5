A second federal witness implicated Pete Rose in an alleged tax-fraud scheme 
involving a winning race track ticket in the trial of former Rose housemate 
Thomas Gioiosa. 
The testimony in the third day of Gioiosa's trial on cocaine and tax-evasion 
charges contradicted Rose's contention that he had nothing to do with the 
winning race ticket. 
Rose has denied any involvement in the winning ticket, and Gioiosa has pleaded 
not guilty. However, accountant Joseph Mansour testified that Gioiosa told him 
he was claiming the ticket for Rose. 
In another development, Gold Star Chili Inc. and Pete Rose have agreed to 
suspend the former Cincinnati Red manager's contract as a spokesman for the 
restaurant chain. 
William K. Stock, chief executive of Gold Star, said in a prepared statement, 
"The attention given recent events has so overshadowed our working relationship 
with Pete that even routine promotional activities have been compromised and a 
temporary hold seems prudent."
