IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
EARLY CHILDBEARING BASED ON LOGIC 
Black teen-agers who have children are not acting irrationally, despite the 
high incidence of health problems among both mothers and children, researchers 
said. Instead, they are simply responding to social realities. 
As the girls get older, their reality is that they become less healthy, there 
are fewer men around, and they may need to enter the work force, said 
sociologist Arline Geronimus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. 
Furthermore, they have to rely on family members to help with the children and 
those members may not be available later in life. 
"I'm not implying that a teen-age girl sits down and thinks this through," 
Geronimus said. But "the fact is that early childbearing is a persistent 
pattern in history for whole populations of women." 
UCLA sociologist Walter Allen noted that most middle-class teen-age girls are 
on their way to economic stability, which includes a husband and a job, so they 
postpone child-bearing. But under-class girls are unlikely ever to reach such 
stability, so they could wait forever to have children. In short, there is no 
disincentive for having children early.
