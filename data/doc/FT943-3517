FT  14 SEP 94 / Dioxin research supports Agent Orange claims
A US report saying dioxin is more likely to cause cancer than was previously
thought should trigger more compensation for veterans exposed to Agent
Orange in the Vietnam War, activists said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Hanoi.
Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, head of a veterans' committee on the issue, said in
Hanoi he would ask President Bill Clinton and congressional committees to
provide extra funds for research on effects of dioxin.
The report by the US Environmental Protection Agency, released in Washington
yesterday, strongly supported the veterans' cause, he added.
Admiral Zumwalt, the most senior wartime US commander to visit Vietnam since
the war, held talks last weekend with Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh and
former communist military commander General Vo Nguyen Giap, who masterminded
the US defeat.
Admiral Zumwalt, 73, carries special weight on the Agent Orange issue
because of intimate involvement with its use and impact. He ordered it
sprayed in southern Vietnam when he commanded US naval forces in Saigon in
1968-70, and became an activist for veterans after his son, a navy
lieutenant who had been exposed to the chemicals in Vietnam, died of cancer
in 1988.
His associate, Dr Arnold Schechter of New York State University in Syracuse,
said research in Vietnam was vital because it had the world's largest
contamination of dioxin.
'This report . . . concludes that dioxins are much more toxic in a number of
different ways than had been thought to be the case previously and it opens
up new areas for compensation,' he said.
The EPA said dioxin was a potential cause of illnesses other than cancer
even at very los levels. These include developmental, reproductive, hormonal
and immune system problems.
He called for stricter regulation of industries that emit dioxins.
