LIMITING TERMS OF ELECTED OFFICIALS 
Now, Henry, you know very well that incumbents cannot lose once they have 
entrenched themselves long enough to amass a war chest and build a political 
barter system. 
You also know that many non-voters are not satisfied with the representation 
they have; they are just convinced that the incumbent cannot be defeated 
because he has the support of the moneyed special interest groups. 
Most Americans have faith in democracy. It's today's politicians they mistrust. 
So the movements to limit tenure.
