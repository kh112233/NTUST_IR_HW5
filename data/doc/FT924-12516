FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (6): Skidmarks and D-Marks -
Germans steer nervously through the currency chaos
AT A TIME when German car companies are battling to bring down costs to the
levels enjoyed by their foreign competitors, export markets have suddenly
been thrown into disarray by turbulence in the currency markets.
After more than five years of peace on the European exchange rate scene,
German manufacturers now survey a landscape in which the UK, Italian, and
Spanish currencies have all fallen sharply in value against the D-Mark. With
economic growth weak across Europe, or non-existent in some countries, price
rises to compensate for the full extent of the devaluations are out of the
question.
Nor is the picture much brighter elsewhere. In the US, which has become an
increasingly rough market in the past few years, the low valuation of the
dollar against the powerful D-Mark has increased the difficulties of selling
German cars.
Competition from Japanese models, whether made in Japan or in 'transplant'
facilities, has changed the US market dramatically, while the tax on luxury
goods - against which German carmakers fume - has also eroded sales.
But while the background may be gloomy, the German industry has performed
surprisingly well so far this year. In the first half, production was 2 per
cent above the level of the same period in 1991, a year which saw west
German production exceed 5m cars for the first time. Exports, which slid
last year by 16 per cent to 2.2m units, were 21 per cent higher in the first
half of 1992 at 1.3m. This jump in exports is partly due to the introduction
of new models, says the German motor industry association (VDA).
In the volume range, Volkswagen has its third generation Golf, and Opel
(part of General Motors) its new Astra, both competing strongly with each
other. But a more important reason for the higher level of foreign
deliveries is the decision of car companies to rebuild their stocks at
foreign dealers.
When unification enabled east Germans to replace their dated Trabants and
Wartburgs with western models, domestic car producers did their utmost to
meet the huge jump in demand.
This was partly at the expense of foreign markets. In 1991, new car
registrations in united Germany soared to 4.2m units; in the previous year,
with the country unified for only three months, the figure was 3m. Of last
year's total, 730,000 were in east Germany and 3.4m in west Germany, which
experienced a 13 per cent rise.
Foreign imports did exceedingly well, showing just how stretched the German
industry was to meet demand. In east Germany, importers took 52 per cent of
the market, led by the French and Japanese. In west Germany, the import
share was 32 per cent, though this was 39 per cent including cars made by
German producers in plants abroad. This year, the post-unification boom has
tailed off. New registrations in the first half of 1992 were down by 9 per
cent, though sales in east Germany showed a marginal rise. For the full
year, the VDA reckons with 'a markedly lower' new registration total for the
whole country. As well as the fading of the east German impulse, the
domestic market has also been affected by higher taxes, high interest rates,
and the dampening influence of the constant discussion in Bonn over new ways
of financing the budget deficit.
With the domestic market having peaked, the German motor industry has
stepped up its efforts abroad. Hence its collective chagrin at the latest
currency upsets. VW, for example, sells more cars to Italy than to any other
export market. Almost as many VWs are sold in the UK and France combined.
Since the end of last year, the D-Mark has appreciated by more than 4 per
cent against EC currencies, by at least 10 per cent against sterling and the
lira, and by nearly 10 per cent against the peseta.
VW says it is not changing prices in markets where currencies have devalued
until the situation is clearer. Mr Tom Purves, managing director of BMW
(GB), said just after the turmoil in the European Monetary System that the
company's UK prices would have to rise at the turn of the year to compensate
for sterling's sharp fall.
But the recession-hit state of the market would mean that BMW could by no
means lift prices by enough to make up for all of this.
So German companies' margins are being squeezed further. The industry has
long been aware that its costs are out of line with those of its
competitors. While the rest of Europe has reduced labour over the past
decade, German companies have added jobs. Now, the Germans are going into
reverse; jobs in the motor industry have already fallen this year by 15,000
to 765,000 people. More cuts are inevitable as companies strive to become
more competitive and offset the effect of high wages and social security
costs, as well as of shorter working weeks.
'Other European automobile nations have increasingly approached Germany's
productivity level in recent years', says Mr Achim Diekmann, the VDA's
managing director. Thus the German industry is no longer able to rely on
productivity advances to offset high labour costs. 'The German industry's
production costs are too high, not just in comparison with Japan but also
with its European rivals', he adds.
In the past, German producers could charge a premium for superior technology
and quality. But, warns Mr Diekmann: 'The premium prices necessary to secure
adequate profits at a time of heavy cost pressures are gradually beginning
to endanger the market position of German products.'
One solution, apart from further cost and job reductions, is to invest in
new efficient plants which make optimum use of modern, streamlined
manufacturing techniques. Opel and VW are doing this in east Germany, where
around 100,000 cars should be produced this year, rising to more than
400,000 in the mid-1990s. VW is also investing heavily in Czechoslovakia
(Skoda), Spain (Seat), Mexico, and China.
But the price for boldness must go to BMW. Earlier this year, it decided to
build a plant in the US to circumvent high German costs, insulate itself
from gyrations in the dollar's value, and develop more productive firepower
for use against its Japanese and other rivals. Audi, the up-market VW
subsidiary, is also considering a North American plant, but BMW will be
there first.
