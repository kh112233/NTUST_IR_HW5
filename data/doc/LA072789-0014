SPOTTED OWLS AND LOGGERS 
I'm distressed that you published Mark A. Stein's one-sided lament for loggers 
in Sweet Home, Ore., who are supposedly losing work because environmentalists 
are trying to save the spotted owl. 
We in the U.S. decry Brazil's and Indonesia's felling of their tropical rain 
forests while we decimate our own old-growth forest at an equally reckless 
rate, contributing to the same global crises: release of carbon dioxide, 
exacerbating the greenhouse effect; and loss of habitat, reducing species 
diversity. 
The "jobs vs. environment" dichotomy is a red herring. Most timber unemployment 
has resulted from modernization of mill equipment. More jobs are lost because 
so many logs are now shipped, unprocessed, to Japan. (We harvest more wood than 
we need and sell 25% to Japan. Yet the Forest Service proposes chopping 25% 
more over the next decade!) 
A study by resource economist Jeffrey T. Olson shows that taking 25% less wood 
would eliminate only 2,300 jobs in 40 years. 
Industry "research" to duplicate spotted owl habitat in the monoculture tree 
plantations with which it replaces nature's forests is absurd. What about all 
the other old growth-dependent species whose survival is threatened by 
ever-shrinking habitat -- grizzly bear, gray wolf, mountain lion, mountain 
goat, wolverine, lynx, fisher, flying squirrel, red tree vole, bog lemming, 
rough-skinned newt, Olympic salamander, tailed frog, goshawk, harlequin duck, 
marbled murrelet, pileated, red-cockaded and three-toed woodpecker, elegant 
trogon, red crossbill, olive-sided flycatcher?
