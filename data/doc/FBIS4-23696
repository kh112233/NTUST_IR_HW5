  [Text] Cape Town June 10 SAPA -- The positive response of 
South African business to the Reconstruction and Development 
Programme would hasten lifting exchange control regulations, 
Trade Minister Trevor Manuel said on Friday [10 June]. Speaking 
at a press conference at the World Economic Forum summit in Cape 
Town he said the African National Congress' economics department 
and Finance Minister Derek Keys believed the controls should be 
lifted as soon as possible. The way South African Business 
responded to the political transition was going to be a key 
determinant of this. 
  Mr Manuel welcomed their response to the programme and their 
willingness to establish a fund for it. "I think political 
certainty will also see more investment by South African 
corporations in new opportunities. All that will hasten the 
date by which we will be able to announce the lifting of 
exchange controls. It is a matter under discussion." 
  Vice-chairman of the United States-based Citicorp and 
Citibank Bill Rhodes told journalists he was "very impressed" 
with the realism of the new government. South Africa needed to 
demonstrate it would continue to show fiscal and monetary 
discipline to obtain a positive credit rating in international 
markets. He said Citicorp had recently been granted a licence 
to open a representative office in South Africa and hoped to be 
able to do so in the next few months. It was already allocating 
funds to trade finance facilities. He sensed a strong 
recognition by the South African Government that they needed to 
maintain the balance between economic reforms and providing 
social necessities. 
  Mr Manuel said funds raised by merchant banks in the US for 
investment in South Africa had done exceedingly well. "They've 
surpassed expectations. That must say something about the way 
people are reading the moment in South Africa."
