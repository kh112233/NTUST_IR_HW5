  [Text] Haikou, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Peng Peiyun, State 
Councillor and minister in charge of State Family Planning 
Commission, recently called for enhancing family planning, 
medical and public health work in the rural areas. 
  In her recent inspection tour in Hainan Province, Peng said 
that although Hainan has achieved progress in population control 
in the past three years, the tendency of fast growth of the 
population in the province remains in the province. 
  She said that the leaders at various level should realize 
the 
arduousness of the task of the family planning. 
  She said that under the condition of establishing socialist 
market structure, it is one of the functions of the government 
in controlling the growth of population. 
  She said that the viewpoint of controlling population growth 
with market regulation cannot meet the demands of China's 
population plan. 
  She urged the grass-root units in Hainan to enhance family 
planning work by integrating the work with economic development 
in rural areas. 
  Peng also affirmed Hainan's methods in introducing funds, 
talents and technology in the development of public health 
services. 
  She called for setting up medical and public health work in 
rural areas as one of key works and solving the problems in 
public health work.
