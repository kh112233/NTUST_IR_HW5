  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] continues with its offensive actions, stepping up 
its shelling of the city of Malange. A military source said 
UNITA yesterday used heavy artillery to shell the Malange 
regional airport. The previous day, UNITA infiltrated a number 
of units into the Catemba Ward, killing five civilians and 
destroying a house. Two hours later, UNITA shelled the outlaying 
areas of Malange, killing seven civilians and wounding 23 others. 
  Meanwhile, more UNITA troops are deserting their ranks. The 
Northern Front reported the surrender of 46 UNITA soldiers 
during the first quarter of 1994. Francisco Manuel, a UNITA 
young soldier who surrendered in Ambriz District a few days ago, 
said people desert mainly because of famine, uncertainty about 
the future, intimidation, and harassment.
