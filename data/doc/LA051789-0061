NO VETO -- 'JUNK FAX' GETS THE AX 
A high-tech lobbying campaign backfired Tuesday as Gov. William A. O'Neill 
signed legislation to restrict the use of fax machines to send unsolicited 
messages. 
Fax owners used their machines last week to flood the governor's office with 
letters urging him to veto the bill, but O'Neill said the protest instead 
convinced him to sign the measure. 
The protest left O'Neill's office unable to use its machine to get information 
from the state Office of Emergency Management about rising river levels and 
possible flooding around the state. 
"I had been following discussion about the legislation but frankly last week 
was the first time the need for this kind of legislation was brought home to 
me," O'Neill said in a statement. 
The new law, which takes effect on Oct. 1, will allow anyone who receives an 
unsolicited advertisement on a fax machine to sue for up to $200 or actual 
damages, whichever is greater. It also allows a person who receives the 
unsolicited material to seek a court order banning future transmissions.
