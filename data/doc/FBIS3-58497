  [Excerpt] Geneva, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Islamic countries 
meeting here Monday [17 January] renewed a call for air strikes 
on Bosnia and issued a veiled threat of economic sanctions 
against countries backing a partition of the former Yugoslav 
republic. 
  Foreign ministers from the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference (OIC) "agree to continue to review their economic 
relations with those governments which continue to impede the 
achievement of a just settlement." 
  But they did not name the governments which they said 
blocked 
chances for peace by "legitimizing the fruits of aggression," a 
reference to a plan that would give Serbs land which they 
captured from the Moslem-led government. 
  "We've not really identified who this is targeted at," 
according to Pakistani Foreign Minister Assef Ahmed Ali, 
chairman of the eight-country OIC group handling the Bosnia 
crisis. 
  "It's just a statement of general principles," he said, 
adding the OIC would try to come up with a common position. 
  Nor did the ministers, meeting here on the eve of resumption 
of Bosnia peace talks, explain what they meant by "a review of 
economic relations." The OIC includes major oil exporters Saudi 
Arabia and Iran. 
  Each country can "read into it what it wishes," Ali said. 
  The OIC group issued their statement after talks with UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic ahead of new talks between the Bosnian factions 
which broke off in December. [passage omitted]
