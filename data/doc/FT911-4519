FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of the Canary Islands (2): Tourist slump leaves
economy exposed - Most investment has gone into services
THE STREETS of Las Palmas, with their bustling traffic, cramped pavements
and lackadaisical atmosphere remind one of any one of a dozen different
Latin American capitals. Unfortunately for Los Canarios, the island's 1.7m
inhabitants, the economy, in spite of the success of tourism in the 1980s,
is beginning to bear remarkable similarities to some of Latin America's
weaker nations.
While the Canaries are far from falling prey to the Argentine or Brazilian
plague of hyperinflation, the islands have become too dependent on a series
of succeeding monocultures - the latest being tourism - as the prime source
of income. Few Canarios today are likely to follow the hundreds of thousands
of their predecessors who, in the 1950s emigrated to Caracas, Buenos Aires
and Havana. But a growing number of them face a distinctly uncertain
economic future.
Mr Cayetano Gonzalez, president of the Export Club of the Canaries, says:
'If the government does not do something to improve the social and economic
situation then, without exaggerating, I think we might be in danger of a
'Carazco' here in two or three years from now.' By a 'Carazco', he means
social upheaval along the lines of that which occurred in the Venezuelan
capital Caracas in February 1988, when several hundred people died during
food riots and mass looting.
A familiar cry from Canarios is that their economy is faced with three
central disadvantages: the distance from mainland Europe; the small and
fragmented nature of the community, split as it is between seven islands;
and the isolated, limited extent of their natural resources.
While all those are true, the situation has been exacerbated by what can
only be called a 'get rich quick' mentality of many of the islands' business
community, which has seen tourism as a cheap and easy way to quickly recover
investments with large profits.
What investment there has been has largely poured into services, at the cost
of long-term planning elsewhere. Now that tourist figures have stabilised at
between 5m and 6m visitors a year, the economy finds itself over-rich in
ugly hotels and under-nourished elsewhere.
The problem is that of recession, which has damaged all Spain. But because
the Canaries have almost nothing to fall back on after a slump in tourism,
the islands are more exposed and have less chance of swift recovery. Tourism
accounts for more than 70 per cent of the gross domestic product of the
islands, the other 30 per cent divided between industry, the ports,
agriculture and construction (whose fortunes are in turn closely linked to
tourism). One of the main planks in the opposition socialist party's
(PSC-PSOE) campaign for elections on May 26 is a programme of public works
construction, in order to soak up the many unemployed building workers.
The islands' industrial sector is very weak, being limited solely to
manufacture for local consumption. The high cost of freight and the lack of
any basic raw materials mean that prospects for developing any export-led
industry are dim.
Inflation during 1990 reached 5.5 per cent, compared with 7.7 per cent in
1989. Overall growth for 1990 is estimated at 2.2 per cent (compared with
mainland Spain's estimated 4.4 per cent) and projected at less than 1 per
cent or perhaps negative for 1991 and 1992.
Perhaps strangely, UK exports to the islands have not been affected by the
local recession.
In 1985 UK exports stood at Pounds 45m (Dollars 79.65m) but that figure has
more than doubled; the January-June 1990 figures alone were Pounds 53.8m
(Dollars 95.22m), a 13 per cent growth over the same period for the previous
year. Only Germany has a greater value of trade with the islands.
The impact of recession is mostly clearly be seen in the growth of
unemployment and social deprivation, an aspect of the Canaries which few of
the sun-seekers ever have cause to witness.
An officially-sponsored report published at the beginning of April (Estudio
sobre la Pobreza en Canarias) reported that 24.83 per cent of islanders -
some 98,000 people - live in poverty (defined as monthly income of Pta29,000
(Dollars 278) or less.
Within that group, a further 7.46 per cent - some 29,000 people - live in
extreme poverty, with monthly income of Pta15,000 (Dollars 144.23) or less.
The European Community average for the first, broader category, is 14 per
cent.
Unemployment, hovering at the 21 per cent mark, is almost 5 per cent higher
than the Spanish national average.
While this is unlikely to spark Venezuelan-style social upheavals, it may
help President Felipe Gonzalez's local representatives to score well against
the centrist alliance in the upcoming May 26 elections.
There hangs a cloud of uncertainty over the islands' business community,
which faces a decade of gradual easing into full adhesion to the European
Community. The Canaries opted to stand aside from many of the EC's
regulations when Spain joined in 1986. That has been yet another mixed
blessing for the islands; the Canaries' relations with Brussels are the
subject of another article in this survey.
