  [Text] The right honorable the prime minister, Dr. Ntsu 
Mokhehle, says the presence of their excellencies the presidents 
of Zimbabwe and Botswana in Lesotho is a testimony to the deep 
commitment that they pledge to the process of building a truly 
democratic and conflict free community of nations in the region. 
  The prime minister said this yesterday in his welcome speech 
on the occasion of the visit of President Robert Mugabe of 
Zimbabwe and President Quett Masire of Botswana. Dr. Ntsu 
Mokhehle said their mission in Lesotho is a peacemaking one 
necessitated by an important recognition that African countries 
can no longer afford conflicts that have wrecked the continent. 
  He noted with appreciation the rapid progress being made 
toward a non-racial democracy in South Africa, and the 
unwavering support of the Frontline States to the liberation 
struggle in that country. He said conflicts are the scourge 
that has bedeviled Africa for ages, adding that they are to 
blame for economic difficulties and poverty in which most 
African peoples find themselves. Meanwhile, the two presidents 
will be taken on a conducted tour to the Lesotho Highlands 
Development Project at Katse today.
