FT  07 FEB 92 / Turkish political violence threatens rights reforms
POLITICAL violence in Turkey is threatening to derail efforts by the
coalition government to introduce human rights reforms.
Mr Yasar Gunaydin, the Istanbul state prosecutor, yesterday became the fifth
security official killed in less than a week when he was gunned down outside
his home.
For many Turks, the attacks have provided a chilling reminder of the
violence which led to 1980 military coup, and the ousting of then minority
government of Mr Suleyman Demirel. The latter became prime minister again
following last October's election and has promised strong action against the
terrorists, while pushing ahead with human rights reforms.
The latest violence represents a serious setback to the reform process. It
is also expected to bolster opposition to the proposals presented last week
by Mr Mehmet Kahraman, the new human rights minister.
Turkey currently faces two terrorist threats. The first is Dev-Sol, an urban
left-wing group active in the 1970s which claimed responsibility for
yesterday's attack and for the killing of 30 policeman and five generals
last year, as well as several western businessmen and foreign diplomats.
More alarming has been the increased violence of the Kurdish separatist PKK
in the south-east. The army says it is preparing for a spring offensive by
the Syrian-backed PKK, which has exploited the power vacuum in neighbouring
north Iraq to pursue its eight-year struggle for an independent Kurdistan.
Turkey has signalled its determination to improve a human rights record,
which has long blighted its otherwise close relations with US and European
allies. Initial proposals centre on changes to the criminal procedure code,
which covers police conduct during arrest and interrogation.
