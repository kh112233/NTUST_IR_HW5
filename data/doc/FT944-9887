FT  14 NOV 94 / East Timor protests embarrass Indonesia
The issue of East Timor is threatening to take the gloss off Indonesia's
hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit, after rioting
shook the East Timorese capital, Dili, this weekend and a group of East
Timorese demonstrators climbed into the US embassy compound.
About 30 East Timorese protesters have been in the compound since Saturday
morning and are demanding to speak to President Bill Clinton, who arrived in
the Indonesian capital last night.
Meanwhile, two US journalists trying to enter East Timor without permission
have been arrested by Indonesian police.
US officials and other Apec delegates have said the issue of East Timor and
human rights in Indonesia will not be raised during the one-day Apec summit
tomorrow. 'This event is not the forum to discuss it,' said Mr Ali Alatas,
Indonesia's foreign minister, said.
However, Mr Clinton is expected to discuss it with President Suharto during
his official visit after the summit.
In Dili at the weekend, East Timorese demonstrators took to the streets
shouting political slogans. According to eye-witness reports relayed to
Australian officials, one East Timorese was killed by an Indonesian but
there were no deaths in the protest.
At the US embassy, East Timorese protestors are demanding that the
Indonesian government hold a referendum in East Timor, which was invaded by
Indonesia in 1975 and annexed a year later.
The embassy says it has been in contact with Indonesian authorities about
the situation. 'We've been consulting with the Indonesian authorities and
been assured that there will be no retribution taken,' said Mr Warren
Christopher, the US secretary of state, in Jakarta on Saturday.
Reports indicate that the situation in Dili has calmed down but the sit-in
by protesters could go on for days.
