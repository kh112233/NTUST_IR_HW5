  [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- Majlis Speaker 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri here Tuesday [26 April] called on parliament speakers 
of Muslim states to use every available channel to press the 
lifting of the United Nations embargo against aggressed Bosnia. 
  In a message to his counterparts in Muslim countries, the 
Hojjat ol-Eslam said that in accordance with Article 51 of the 
United Nations Charter, imposition of arms embargo against 
Bosnia which is suffering from Serb aggression, should be 
regarded as violation of the republic's sovereignty. 
  Nateq-Nuri addressed himself to his counterparts in Islamic 
states, and emphasized that the only possibility to confront the 
ongoing genocide and aggression against the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is honouring the people's and the 
government's right of defending sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of the republic. 
  The message stressed that the issue of lifting the arms 
embargo should be taken into consideration in any peace talks of 
the contact group of the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
(OIC) at the UN. 
  The speaker said that the unsuccessful experience of 
diplomatic negotiations to restore peace in Bosnia has 
practically led to weakening of the Muslims and strengthening of 
the Serb aggressors.
