FT  05 FEB 93 / Japanese lose ground in drugs market
EUROPEAN and US drugs groups are threatening to dominate the world's market,
leaving their Japanese counterparts trailing, according to a study* by
Datamonitor, the London-based strategy consultants.
In particular, the European groups' dominance will be driven by their
innovative research and development, new products and international
marketing strength.
Only three Japanese companies, Takeda, Sankyo and Shionogi, are among the
world's top 25 drugs groups, and none is in the top 10. Japan ran a trade
deficit of more than Pounds 800m in 1989.
Repeated price cuts implemented by the Ministry of Health and Welfare have
seriously handicapped the Japanese industry. While drug prices in the US
increased by 40 per cent between 1982 and 1988, those in Japan fell 39 per
cent. In 1991 alone, Shionogi and Fujisawa suffered average price cuts of
9.5 per cent and 9 per cent. respectively.
Japanese groups have been hit disproportionately because of their dependence
on the domestic market. Takeda, the largest Japanese group, generates 98.6
per cent of its turnover in Japan.
Japanese spending on research and development has doubled in the past 10
years, though sales increased only 50 per cent. The Datamonitor report
warns, however, that the Japanese R&amp;D push may come too late, because of
increasing penetration of the Japanese market by western drugs groups. This,
it argues, is likely to accelerate a consolidation of the Japanese industry.
