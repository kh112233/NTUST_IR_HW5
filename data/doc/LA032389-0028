MAN KILLED BY TRAIN FLIRTED WITH DEATH 
A man who was struck and killed by a train in Reseda was apparently playing 
"chicken" on the railroad tracks and waited too long to jump to safety, Los 
Angeles police said Wednesday. 
Mark Anthony Brown, 22, of Reseda was fatally injured about 10 p.m. Tuesday on 
the Southern Pacific tracks north of Roscoe Boulevard near White Oak Avenue, 
police said. 
Police ruled the death accidental. Detective Sandra Palmer said Brown, who may 
have been intoxicated, was standing on the tracks and apparently attempted to 
jump to safety as the train went by. 
Brown managed to jump clear of the tracks but was hit by a handrail on the side 
of the train and knocked into a ditch, where he was found dead, police said.
