FT  14 OCT 93 / Minimum wage rise warning
THE desire of the Clinton administration to raise the federal minimum wage,
restated this week by Mr Robert Reich, labour secretary, is meeting stiff
business resistance, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
Mr Reich said he was thinking of recommending a rise of 50 cents to Dollars
4.75 an hour, but he said some of the increment might be accounted for by
new healthcare benefits for the low-paid. The last rise, from Dollars 3.80
an hour, was in 1991.
Nearly 5m Americans are being paid the federal minimum, or less. Mr Reich,
arguing this base figure was worth 30 per cent less in real terms than 25
years ago, doubted an increase would have any negative impact on
unemployment.
However, spokesmen for small businesses, especially the hotel, fast-food
restaurant and retail trades, countered that job losses were inevitable.
