SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Nancy Hoover Hunter claimed that she was entitled to three residences, half of 
two others, part ownership in 23 companies, and three promissory notes totaling 
$61,200 that officials seized in the aftermath of the J. David &amp; Co. 
bankruptcy, according to the former bankruptcy trustee of the J. David estate. 
Retired Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Louis Metzger, testifying Tuesday in Hunter's 
fraud and tax-evasion trial, told jurors that Hunter filed a claim asking for a 
Rancho Santa Fe "mansion," a house in La Jolla, and a ski lodge in Deer Valley, 
Utah. 
Metzger said the Rancho Santa Fe residence, which she shared with J. David 
(Jerry) Dominelli, was a mansion with a guest house, swimming pool, and both 
gasoline and diesel fuel pumps. "It was a huge place, beautifully done," he 
said. 
Hunter also claimed ownership of a Mercedes-Benz 300, mink and sable coats, and 
10 thoroughbred racehorses, Metzger said. Hunter made the claim after the 
seizure of these and other assets by bankruptcy officials in February, 1984, 
which resulted when angry investors made a run on the J. David investment 
house. 
Federal officials say that many of the properties and goods consolidated were 
bought with investors' funds that were stolen by Dominelli while he operated a 
huge Ponzi scheme out of his La Jolla investment house. 
Prosecutors allege that Hunter played a key role in the fraud, which bilked 
about 1,200 people out of as much as $90 million. 
The defense in the 234-count trial maintains that Hunter was unaware of 
Dominelli's activities because he and his associates lied to her.
