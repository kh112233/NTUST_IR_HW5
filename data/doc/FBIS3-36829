Ship Threatens Japanese Fishermen"] 
  [Text] Russian Federation Border Troops -- On 7 February 
in the southern Kurils sector a Border Troops patrol boat 
assisted by helicopters arrested two Japanese schooners in 
Russian territorial waters. When they were inspected, recently 
caught sea creatures and wet gear were discovered aboard. 
  The poacher ships' captains signed a document attesting to 
the violation of Russia's state border and illegal fishing. The 
offending schooners are currently at roadstead in Tyaginskaya 
Bay. Commenting on this incident, the Russian Federation Border 
Troops High Command noted that the situation in the central part 
of the Sea of Okhotsk is now under the strict control of Russian 
Border Troops naval forces and aviation.
