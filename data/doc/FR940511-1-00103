<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to amend its regulations on the use and recredit of sick leave for
Federal employees. The proposed regulations would expand the use of sick leave by permitting employees to use up to
a total of 5 workdays of sick leave each leave year (or, in the case of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon
tour of duty, the average number of hours of work in the employee's scheduled tour of duty each week) to provide care
for a child, spouse, or parent as a result of sickness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth; make arrangements necessitated
by the death of a child, spouse, or parent; or attend the funeral of a child, spouse, or parent. In addition,the proposed
regulations would remove the 3-year break-in-service limitation on the recredit of sick leave.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

OPM proposes to amend 5 CFR 630.401 to provide that agencies must grant a limited amount of sick leave to employees who
provide care for a child, spouse, or parent as a result of sickness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth; to make arrangements
necessitated by the death of a child, spouse, or parent; or to attend the funeral of a child, spouse, or parent. The proposed
regulations would limit the use of sick leave for these purposes to a total of 5 workdays in a leave year (or, in the case
of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, the average number of hours of work in the employee's
scheduled tour of duty each week).



In addition, OPM proposes to amend 5 CFR 630.502 and 504 to remove the 3-year break-in-service limitation on the recredit
of sick leave and permit employees who separate from Federal service to have their unused and accrued sick leave recredited
in full to their sick leave accounts upon return to Federal service. Under the proposed regulations, sick leave would
be recredited to the employee regardless of the duration of the break in Federal service.
