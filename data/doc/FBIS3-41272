<F P=106> [Interview with Brigo Asparukhov, director of the National </F>
Intelligence Service, by Angelina Petrova; place and date not 
given: "Secret List of Companies Belonging to State Security Was 
Openly Photocopied in Interior Ministry"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Petrova] What information 
does the NRS have about the present participation of Bulgarians 
in the narcotics trafficking that has always been routed through 
our country? 
  [Asparukhov] I am worried about the possibility that in the 
near future, narcotics money will flow into our economy during 
the forthcoming privatization. When this happens, it will 
become almost impossible to combat the narcotics trade. This 
money will then be laundered and no one will be able to prove 
its origin. The profits from narcotics trafficking worldwide 
amount to U.S.$400 billion. 
  The fight against organized crime, of which the sale of 
narcotics forms a part, requires decisive actions. This 
primarily means we need a clear program, in which the NRS and 
all the Interior Ministry organs should play a part. It is 
particularly important that the National Security Service--our 
counterintelligence--is also involved. [passage omitted] 
  [Petrova] Those who defend the protection and security 
companies claim that they have succeeded in preventing foreign 
mafias, including the Russian mafia, from establishing 
themselves in Bulgaria. Is this true? 
  [Asparukhov] There are no grounds for making such a claim. 
It is a manifest fact that foreign mafias or organized criminal 
groups from the former socialist countries, Russia included, are 
invading our country. Money, narcotics, and criminals are being 
imported to carry out special tasks for the criminal world. The 
private security firms in Bulgaria probably have their part to 
play in the future market economy, but it will hardly be within 
their powers to deal with the penetration of foreign mafias. 
This claim is frivolous. [passage omitted]
