FT  16 AUG 93 / Cairo military trial begins

first session of a Cairo military trial yesterday.
Fifty-three Moslem militants are accused of belonging to an illegal
organisation plotting to overthrow the Egyptian government, Reuter reports.
Earlier a Cairo civilian court at the weekend acquitted 24 alleged Moslem
militants who were accused of murdering parliamentary speaker Mr Riffat
Mahgoub, who was gunned down together with five of his bodyguards in October
1990, adds Shahira Idris.
The State Security Court cleared 14 of the defendents on all charges and
jailed the remaining 10 for terms ranging from three to 15 years for
possession of arms, forging documents and other related charges.
The verdict was in sharp contrast to the 15 death sentences passed by
military courts on Moslem fundamentalists in the past two months.
After a spate of terrorist attacks by Moslem extremists, resulting in the
death of over 170 people in the last 18 months, the Egyptian government has
resorted to military courts in cases involving Moslem militants to ensure
harsh and swift sentences.
