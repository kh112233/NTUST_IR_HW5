FT  28 NOV 94 / CDU women resist fixed job quotas
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will today try to
agree on quotas designed to give women a higher profile within the party
despite evidence that many of them want nothing of the sort.
Several have spoken out ahead of the one-day national congress saying quotas
 -which would reserve one third of the party's positions for women - are not
helpful. 'It's a democratic crutch,' said Ms Rita Sussmuth, speaker of the
Bundestag, or lower house of parliament.
The quota is the only big issue at the congress, which meets in Bonn for the
first time since the mid-October election victory, and will also re-elect
its 13-strong council and the 26-strong national executive.
However, much of the talk on the sidelines is expected to focus on who will
succeed Mr Kohl, who said just before the October elections that he would
not stand again in 1998.
Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the wheelchair-bound leader of the parliamentary
party, has long been regarded as Mr Kohl's designated successor, and the
1,000 or so delegates will be paying particular attention to what he says.
However a handful of younger politicians - including Mr Jurgen Ruttgers, the
new research and technology minister - have been mentioned in recent weeks
as possible alternatives.
The quota is likely to be approved, given that Mr Kohl has thrown his weight
behind the idea in the hope that it will improve his standing among women
voters.
For many other CDU members it is also seen as a last-ditch solution to a
problem which has been often talked about but never solved: the CDU has just
13.9 per cent women in its ranks, less than the 26.3 per cent average for
parliament as a whole.
However, opponents of the quota said it would be better to adopt the model
used by the CDU in the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg, where a fixed
percentage of women are nominated but the election itself is left open.
