FT  09 JUL 92 / Brussels paves way for genetic food law
NEW genetically engineered food and food ingredients would be subject to
common authorisation procedures under a proposal approved yesterday by the
EC Commission.
The regulation which the 12 are expected to approve would monitor such
products as the 'flavour-saver' tomato - dependent on a gene which blocks
the ripening process - or the 'viruscoat' protein for potatoes, to cut use
of chemical products during storage.
The planned law, to cover everything except additives, should screen the
entry of all new or genetically altered substances into the food chain.
Manufacturers will first have to notify their national authorities of a new
product, which will look at it in the light of 'generally accepted
scientific criteria' and the new regulation. Normally, the product will be
waved through. But 'if there is a substance on which there is no established
history of safe use, then it has to be authorised' by a committee of
scientific experts from member states.
The move drew fire from Green Euro-MPs who called it 'a collection of giant
loopholes'.
