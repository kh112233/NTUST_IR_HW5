  [Text] Asyut, 19 Apr (MENA)--A terrorist was killed in an 
exchange of gunfire with police forces at the Manfalut bus 
station in Asyut, Upper Egypt, this afternoon. The terrorist, 
Mukhtar Husayn Kamil, is accused of killing Police Sergeant

the terrorist's companions, who had recently surrendered and 
repented, that Kamil frequented the Manfalut bus station. When 
the terrorist felt that the police force were tightening the 
noose around him, he fired at the policemen. The police advised 
him to stop firing but he continued to fire indiscriminantly. 
The policemen were forced to return the fire, killing him 
instantly. He had in his possession a pistol stolen from a 
policeman. He was from from al-Qusiyah and used Manfalut as a 
base for his terrorist acts. He hid in Manfalut after 
assassinating Hilal 'Ali Ibrahim last year. The Manfalut 
Prosecution Office has been notified to begin investigations 
under the supervision of Counsellor Muhammad Mursi Muhammad 
'Ali, public attorney in the prosecution office of north Asyut.
