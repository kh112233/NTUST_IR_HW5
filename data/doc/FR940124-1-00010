Claims Based on Chronic Effects of Exposure to Vesicant Agents 




<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its adjudication regulations concerning compensation
for disabilities or deaths resulting from the chronic effects of in-service exposure to mustard gas and other vesicant
agents. This proposed regulation is based on a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study of the long-term health effects
of exposure to vesicant agents, commissioned by VA, which found a relationship between such exposure and the subsequent
development of certain conditions. The intended effect of this proposed amendment is to expand and extend compensation
eligibility.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments must be received on or before March 25, 1994. Comments will be available for public inspection until April
4, 1994. This amendment is proposed to be effective the date of publication of the final rule.

ADDRESSES:

 Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, suggestions, or objections regarding this amendment

to Secretary of Veterans Affairs (271A), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC
20420. All written comments received will be available for public inspection only in the Veterans Services Unit,
room 170, at the above address between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday (except holidays), until
April 4, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On July 31, 1992, VA published a final regulation (38 CFR 3.316) authorizing service connection in claims from veterans
who underwent full-body exposure to mustard gas during field or chamber experiments to test protective clothing
or equipment during World War II, and who subsequently develop chronic forms of laryngitis, bronchitis, emphysema,
asthma, conjunctivitis, keratitis, or corneal opacities (See 57 FR 16991700 and 57 FR 3387577). The
regulation was based on a review of the available English language medical literature dealing with the effects of
exposure to mustard gas by Veterans Health Administration (VHA) personnel. VA also contracted with NAS to conduct
a review of the world medical and scientific literature, including that published in languages other than English,
to determine the long-term health effects of exposure to mustard agents and Lewisite. After reviewing almost 2,000
medical and scientific 
papers, consulting with outside experts, and conducting public hearings, NAS issued that report, entitled ``Veterans
at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite'', on January 6, 1993. We are proposing to amend 38 CFR 3.316
based upon our review of that report. 



NAS findings confirmed VA's prior determination that there is a relationship between exposure to mustard gas and
the subsequent development of the seven conditions previously mentioned. NAS also found that the evidence indicated
a causal relationship between exposure to mustard gas and the subsequent development of ``recurrent corneal ulcerative
disease'' and ``delayed recurrent keratitis of the eye.'' In our judgment the term ``corneal opacities,'' used in
the current regulation, is broad enough to include corneal ulcerative disease and we do not propose to change the language
in the current regulation. For reasons discussed below, this regulation will cover specified conditions whether
onset occurred immediately after exposure or was delayed, and we find no reason to modify the term ``keratitis'' which
appears in the current regulation. 

NAS also found that the evidence indicated a causal relationship between exposure to mustard gas and the subsequent
development of nasopharyngeal, laryngeal, lung, and skin cancers, pigmentation abnormalities of the skin, and
chronic skin ulceration and scar formation. We propose to add nasopharyngeal, laryngeal and lung cancer (except
mesothelioma) to the list of conditions for which presumptive service connection may be granted based on exposure
to mustard gas. We are proposing to exclude mesothelioma from the regulatory amendment, however, since the only known
cause of that condition is asbestos exposure. 

Although NAS used the term ``skin cancer'' in the summary of its findings, in our judgment the body of the report, which
refers to squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the skin but not malignant melanomas, does not support so broad
a presumption of service connection. Although basal cell skin cancers were noted in some animal studies, these studies
constitute evidence of carcinogenicity rather than evidence of skin cancer because there is no good animal model
for human skin response to mustard agents. Likewise, the one occupational study that described basal cell carcinomas,
Bowen's disease, and other hyperkeratotic skin lesions was too seriously flawed to establish a causal relationship
with exposure to mustard agents. As the report notes, the workers in that study were exposed to all types of gases, not
just mustard gas and Lewisite. Also, those individuals who participated in chamber and field testing suffered acute
rather than chronic exposure like the chemical plant workers in the occupational study, which occurred for many hours
each week over many years. The report states that ``cutaneous cancers following acute sulfur mustard exposure usually
localize in scars,'' and scar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, not basal cell carcinomas. Finally, since the
1973 Jackson and Adams study, which is cited in the NAS report in reference to 
the occurrence of basal cell carcinoma and which included two cases of basal cell carcinomas in World War I veterans,
is not an epidemiologic study, it is difficult to draw conclusions as to whether the findings represent an unusual
rate for basal cell carcinoma. For these reasons, we propose to include only squamous cell carcinomas of the skin.
