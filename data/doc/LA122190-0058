BUS-TRAIN CRASH KILLS 40 
More than 40 people were killed and 14 injured when a train crashed into a bus 
in southern Taiwan on Thursday, police said. They said the crash, at a level 
crossing about 20 miles north of the port of Kaohsiung, was apparently caused 
by the failure of a safety barrier to come down.
