FT  14 MAR 94 / Japanese drug price cuts to average 6.6%
Pharmaceutical price cuts announced late last week by Japan's ministry of
health and welfare will reduce prices by 6.6 per cent on average.
The cuts are based on a complicated formula related to the level of
discounts offered by manufacturers to wholesalers. They are due to be
implemented on April 1, further slowing growth of Japan's prescription drugs
market.
Sankyo, the country's second largest drugs group, was among those worst hit,
suffering an average 8.1 per cent reduction on its eight top selling
products, according to brokers Lehman Brothers. Zantac, the world's
top-selling product which Sankyo markets for Glaxo of the UK, suffered a
10.3 per cent price reduction.
Sankyo was particularly hit because the ministry introduced a special 12.2
per cent price cut for Mevalotin, a cholesterol-lowering drug which is
Japan's biggest-selling medicine, with estimated annual sales last year of
Y99.6bn (Pounds 630m). Banyu, the subsidiary of Merck, the US group, was
also the victim of a 12.2 per cent special price cut on Lipovas, its
cholesterol treatment.
The special cuts have upset the industry because they are targeted at
particularly successful medicines, and are not based on the usual formula.
Interferons, used to treat hepatitis and cancer, were also subject to
special reductions. Sales of cholesterol-lowering drugs increased more than
20 per cent last year in Japan.
