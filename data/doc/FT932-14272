FT  20 APR 93 / Minister urges schools visits
MR TIM Boswell, the further and higher education minister, yesterday called
on employers to visit primary schools to 'bring the curriculum alive' for
pupils.
He said: 'No child is too young to start learning the skills which will be
needed in adult working life. So it is particularly important that
school-business links start early, even in the primary school.
'Collaboration between education and business should not be something which
happens only when pupils and students are about to enter employment.'
