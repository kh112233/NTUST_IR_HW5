  [Text] The Petroleum Energy Center (PEC), directed by 
Yasunori Tateuchi, chairman of the Japan Petroleum Association, 
plans to put two naphtha-based phosphate fuel cells into 
operation in July and October of this year. In July, it will put 
a 50KW phosphate fuel cell into operation at the Kuwa House 
located in Waraku-no-kyo in Chiba Prefecture, and in October, 
put a 200KW phosphate fuel cell into operation at the Global 
Environment Industrial Research Institute [Chikyu Kankyo Sangyo 
Gijutsu Kiko] in Kyoto. The aim will be to conduct demonstration 
tests and evaluate their performance over the next three years. 
  The PEC will begin testing a 50KW and 200KW phosphate fuel 
cell this year as part of its research to demonstrate 
high-efficiency petroleum energy systems. 
  In addition to a 50KW fuel cell which will be put into 
operation starting in July at the Kuwa House in Waraku-no-kyo in 
Chiba Prefecture, the PEC also plans to put a 200KW fuel cell 
into operation in October at the Global Environment Industrial 
Research Institute. 
  The research calls for tests on a naphtha-based phosphate 
fuel cells, followed by tests on another kerosene-type fuel cell 
which is nearing completion. In other activities, it is also 
promoting R&amp;D on a high-temperature fuel cell having to do 
with 
petroleum cogeneration and public sector use. 
  Fuel cells, which are high-efficiency electrothermal supply 
systems, are being developed by the petroleum, electric power, 
and gas industries.
