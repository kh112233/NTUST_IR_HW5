  [Text] Dar es Salaam, June 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Sichuan Corporation for International Techno-Economic 
Co-Operation (Sietco) and the Tanzania Electric Supply Company 
(Tanesco) signed here today a contract for phase one of the 
multi-million dollar Kihansi hydro-power station in Iringa 
region, central Tanzania. 
  Sietco was among the 12 international companies bidding for 
the 30 million U.S. dollar first phase contract. The tender 
documents were opened last September in Dar es Salaam. 
  Under the contract, the Chinese firm will start preparations 
for the power station, which include the construction of a 17 
kilometers access road, air strip, camps, treated water supply, 
power supply and telecommunication facilities. 
  The Kihansi hydropower project is for the construction of 
180mw power plant at the Kihansi River falls situated in Iring 
region. The whole project is split into 10 different contracts. 
  The project is part of the Power VI program being financed 
by 
the World Bank and other donors including Norway, European 
Investment Bank, Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden. The 
total financing package of the Power VI program is 340.5 million 
U.S. dollars, of which the International Development Association 
(IDA) of the World Bank, has already committed 200 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  The managing director of the project said when putting into 
full operation in 1998, the Kihansi hydropower plant would feed 
all its power into the national grid. The project was part of 
the efforts by Tanesco to satisfy the national power demand 
which has been growing tremendously over the years, he added. 
  Sietco, which came to Tanzania more than three years ago, 
has 
so far won seven tenders here, including road rehabilitation 
projects, house building of houses and national park lodges.
