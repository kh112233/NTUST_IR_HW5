  [Text] Malaysia will attend a meeting of the Organization 
of Islamic Council, OIC [Islamic Conference Organization -- 
ICO], contact group on Bosnia-Herzegovina in New York on 
Wednesday. A statement issued today by Wisma Putra [Foreign 
Ministry] stated that Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad 
Badawi will represent Malaysia at the ministerial meeting. 
According to the statement, the meeting was significant in the 
context of underlining the seriousness and commitment of 
Malaysia and other Islamic countries toward the Bosnians' 
struggle. It was also to intensify the OIC's joint effort to 
end the Serbian aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Malaysia would 
continue to urge the Security Council to lift the arms embargo 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina to enable the Bosnians to defend 
themselves. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Lim Hong Seng, chief of the MCA's [Malaysian 
Chinese Association] Bureau of International Affairs, called on 
the five permanent members of the United Nations Security 
Council to provide adequate protection for the Bosnians. In a 
statement issued in Kuala Lumpur, he said the attacks on the 
safe havens by the aggressors indicated the UN's inability to 
implement its resolution after resolution.
