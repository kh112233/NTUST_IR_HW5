THIRD WORLD DEBT 
"Living standards in sub-Saharan Africa have been declining steadily for more 
than a decade," says Barber Conable (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 3). In other words, the 
mother who bought a loaf of bread in 1980 now gets by on a half. 
Yet in the rest of his column the president of the World Bank loses touch with 
that mother. He prefers sophisticated financial arguments over Third World 
debt. The economic-adjustment programs applied by the bank have resulted in big 
reductions in health care and social services in debtor countries. So the 
mother must walk farther to the clinic when her children are sick. 
In the end, it is the poor who suffer most from the debt crisis. As part of 
U.S. support for the World Bank, we must force it to look at the human face of 
poverty. The problems of the African mothers are easily hidden behind the 
billions of dollars of debt.
