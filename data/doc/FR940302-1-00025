developing health-based standards for lead in paint, dust, and soil (59 FR 9170, February 25, 1994). The purpose of
the meeting was to review the Agency's regulatory approach and the findings of recent analytical and research efforts

Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 directed the Agency to promulgate a regulation which shall identify lead-based paint
hazards, lead contaminated dust, and lead contaminated soil. The meeting was scheduled to be held from 10 a.m. to 
3 p.m. at the EPA Auditorium in the EPA Education Center, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC, 20460. EPA will announce the
new date for the meeting in the
