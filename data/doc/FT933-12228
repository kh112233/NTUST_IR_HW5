FT  26 JUL 93 / Four hurt in Turk bombing
A BOMB injured three foreign tourists and a Turk at a tourist site in
central Istanbul, yesterday, agencies report.
It was not immediately clear whether the blast was connected with threats by
the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to attack Turkish tourist
sites. But it coincided with other violence blamed on the PKK.
Armed PKK rebels meanwhile kidnapped four French tourists from a bus in
south-eastern Turkey.
In another incident, a mine planted on a railway exploded near the town of
Bingol, derailing a passenger train. Two soldiers protecting the train were
killed and three other people on board were injured. Officials blamed the
PKK for the attack.
Police said the Istanbul bomb had been left in a litter basket under an
automated bank teller machine near the sixth-century Haghia Sophia
Cathedral.
The tourists, two of them Italians, and the Turk were all slightly injured.
No damage was reported to the Haghia Sophia, one of the world's most
celebrated monuments of Byzantine architecture.
