CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE BRIDE WHO RAN AWAY BY DIANA O'HEHIR (WASHINGTON SQUARE 
PRESS / POCKET BOOKS: $6.95) 
"Grazia: How can you be a Dowell and be so free of despair?," Steve writes to 
his first cousin and fiance Grace Dowell, the novel's narrator. "An optimistic 
Dowell . . . is not natural." 
The Dowell clan is indisputably an eccentric lot. Grace's great-aunt Sybil may 
be certifiably mad, and Grace's older cousin Steve -- handsome, possibly 
brilliant, and definitely impenetrable -- is pretentious and unpleasant. 
Grace, a bright, well-adjusted 19-year-old, has been in love with Steve since 
age 3. Now her aunt Sybil and a fortuneteller named Fleesha the Futurist are 
warning her to break loose from a "Disastrous Attachment." 
And, when Grace discovers a mysterious connection between Steve and the suicide 
of a newly married second cousin, she becomes "the bride who ran away." 
A friend from childhood, David "Duke" McCracken, himself has reasons to flee 
after witnessing a crime implicating his older brothers. So the fugitive and 
the runaway stumble from truck stops to casinos in Reno to low-grade diners, 
always just one step ahead of the law. 
A tale both merry and sad of innocence lost and personal declarations of 
independence.
