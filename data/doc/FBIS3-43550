  [Text] A journalist was killed and two wounded when 
ANC/SACP [African National Congress/South African Communist 
Party] tour of Katlehong on the East Rand ended in tragedy 
today. Several residents were also injured when gunfire erupted 
from a nearby hostel. Jessica Pitchford reports that the visit 
was one of steps in a peace plan announced by the ANC PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region on Thursday. 
Following visuals by (Mzima Dudi) and REUTERS: 
  [Begin recording] [Pitchford] We began our day in Katlehong 
with a visit to the hostels. Residents here denied recent 
allegations of abduction and killing. They showed us bullet 
scarred walls and said they were the victims. Very soon we 
were. In nearby Dikolale section TEC [Transitional Executive 
Council] members, Cyril Ramaphosa and Joe Slovo, with the ANC's 
Robert McBride and Carl Niehaus, surveyed war-ravaged homes. 

    Suddenly all hell broke loose. The shooting came from the 
nearby hostel. Self-defense units grabbed their guns. 
Journalists ducked for cover, but for some it was too late. 
Freelance photographer, Abdul Shariff, was killed. SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation] reporter, Charles Moikanyang, 
was shot in the hip. 
  [Moikanyang] It was a mad situation. I see one man coming 
and falling down, and when I try to look back at him, and then I 
felt the pain at the back, and then I fell down. I couldn't 
move. And people were now moving out of the area, and I was 
like worried that everybody is going to go out and leave me 
behind. Then I screamed to you, and you also screamed, and then 
fortunately you called people to come and help. 
  [Pitchford] Another SABC journalists, Anthea Warner, was 
slightly injured. The situation in Katlehong can perhaps best 
be described in the words of injured reporter, Charles 
Moikanyang. 
  [Moikanyang] Well it has been my feeling recently that 
Katlehong, Thokoza have become hopeless, and we didn't, you 
know, enjoy the thought of coming to do coverage of a story in 
this area, but it's all in the game. [end recording] 
  [Adrian Steed] Reporter Karen Kriel is at police 
headquarters 
in Johannesburg where a news conference is just being held on 
these shootings in Katlehong. Karen what do the police say? 
  [Kriel] Police say that three people have killed one person. 
[sentence as heard] They displayed four AK-47s they 
confiscated. The police are still uncertain whether the weapons 
confiscated belonged to hostel dwellers or residents that used 
them in self- defense. The police came under fire from 
journalists who were at the scene, who said they didn't see one 
single policeman, only a helicopter. In reply the police said 
they maintained a presence in the area, but were never requested 
by the ANC to accompany the tour. 
  [Steed] And Karen, after the attack Cyril Ramaphosa said, 
and 
I quote, the police must have known we were coming, we're just 
surprised and shocked that there was no attempt to have police 
presence and protection in the area. What did the police have 
to say about that? 
  [Kriel] Adrian, Brigadier Zirk Gouws said if a certain 
political party doesn't want the police to interfere, they 
don't. And in reaction to a question whether the police would 
not act in a potentially dangerous situation such as this one if 
they were not asked to do so, the police replied it depended on 
the situation. 
  [Steed] Thank you Karen.
