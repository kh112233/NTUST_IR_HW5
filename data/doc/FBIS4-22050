  [Text] Two more people have been arrested in the last few 
hours in relation to the case involving the Zarate Willka 
terrorist group. But one of them, photographer David Garcia, 
already has been released for lack of evidence. [begin 
recording] 
  Unidentified reporter: These men belong to the 
Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Front terrorist group. The group 
members became known a few years ago when they murdered two 
Mormons, two Americans, in La Paz. These images from our files 
remind us that these men were sentenced, in some cases, to 20 
years in prison. In the last few hours police arrested Judith 
Munoz and David Garcia for their alleged involvement in this 
case. It has been reported, however, that David Garcia did not 
have any participation in the murder of the two Mormons. 
Therefore, Judith Munoz will be formally accused of belonging to 
the terrorist group. 
  Minister of Government German Quiroga: We found a 
close link between that woman and the Mormons' murder. 
Therefore, police are carrying out an investigation in that 
direction. 
  Reporter: Reliable Bolivian police sources 
indicated that a clearly identified jeep was used when the 
Mormons were murdered. The finding of the jeep at her house lead 
to Judith Munoz' arrest. [end recording]
