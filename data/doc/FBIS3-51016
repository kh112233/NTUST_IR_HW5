  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Cuban economic developments monitored through 11 
January 1994. Source is cited in parentheses following item. 
  The tourism sector, considered one of the keys to changing 
the current Cuban crisis, grossed approximately $700 million in 
revenues in 1993, which represents approximately one-half of the 
net income. Tourism is the only sector of the Cuban economy that 
reached sustained annual growth rates surpassing 25 percent in 
the 1990's. In 1991, 366,000 tourists visited the island. In 
1992, this figure rose to 490,000 and to approximately 600,000 
in 1993. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0008 GMT 5 Jan 94)
