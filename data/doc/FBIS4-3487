  [Text] Shenyang, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The expressway from 
Shenyang to Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province is 
playing an important role in the economic progress of the 
Liaodong Peninsula. 
  Occupying 36.1 percent of the total area of Liaoning 
Province, the peninsula has achieved an average economic growth 
rate of over 20 percent in recent years. 
  In 1993 the total industrial and agricultural output of the 
peninsula was over 60 percent of the total for the province. 
  The area has become a major attraction for overseas 
investors 
in the province, having become the most concentrated area of 
Sino- foreign joint ventures. 
  Three state economic and technological development zones 
have 
been set up along the expressway. They now have over 2,000 
foreign- funded firms. 
  Along the expressway are located five major industrial 
cities 
of Shenyang, Liaoyang, Anshan, Yingkou and Dalian. 
  Taking advantage of convenient transportation, 31 counties 
in 
the locality have attained an average economic growth of 30 
percent, and township enterprises export nearly 220 million U.S. 
dollars-worth of goods annually. 
  The Shenyang-Dalian expressway has also promoted the 
circulation of commodities and the market economy. The annual 
volume of business in the hundreds of markets along the route is 
almost two billion yuan (about 250 million U.S. dollars), 
accounting for more than 60 percent of the provincial total. 
  In addition, the tourism industry has been growing. The 
number of overseas tourists visiting the Liaodong Peninsula has 
increased from 100,000 a year in the past to 200,000 a year now.
