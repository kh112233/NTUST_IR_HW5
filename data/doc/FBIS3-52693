  [Excerpt] Israel has proposed to Jordan that it lease to 
Israel those territories in the 'Arava that Amman is demanding 
be returned to its sovereignty and that joint economic projects 
be set up there. The proposal was raised at Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres' meeting with Jordan's King Husayn in Amman two 
months ago. 
  A year ago, Israel also proposed digging a channel through 
the 'Arava from the Gulf of Elat to the Dead Sea. The waters 
from the channel would flow over the disputed area, and joint 
tourism projects would be set up on its banks. Jordan is 
demanding an area of 320 square km in the 'Arava which Israel 
took over 20 years ago. Some of the area is cultivated by 'Arava 
settlements. 
  Political sources said yesterday that the size of the 
disputed area is still unclear because the Israeli-Jordanian 
border in the 'Arava was never authoritatively marked either on 
maps or on the ground. The agenda agreed on in the 
Israeli-Jordanian peace talks in Washington states that in 
determining the international border, the border dating to the 
British Mandate, on the basis of maps and the situation on the 
ground, would be taken into account. [passage omitted]
