  [Text] JAKARTA, Jan 14 (AFP) -- The Indonesian navy has 
deployed four ships, including three frigates, in a two-month 
naval operation to safeguard the waters near Natuna islands in 
South China Sea, a navy spokesman said here Friday. 
  "The operation is aimed at maintaining security in the area 
and to anticipate the possible visits of Cambodian and 
Vietnamese boat people who are often found visiting the 
islands," Indonesian West Fleet Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel 
Sunarto Wibow told AFP by telephone. 
  "Although we do not receive any more reports on piracy in 
the 
past 12 months we have to stay alert," he said, adding the 
operation would end in February. 
  Sunarto said the "Natuna Jaya Operation" involved three 
frigates and a supporting tanker ship.
