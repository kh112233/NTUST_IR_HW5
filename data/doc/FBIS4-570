  [Excerpt] Security personnel of the Nigerian Airports 
Authority have been given the power to carry firearms in a 
renewed effort to check the activities of criminals at the 
airports. The Authority has also been empowered, through an 
enabling decree, to prosecute offenders. The managing director 
of the Authority, (Alhaji Ibrahim Mahaman), announced this in 
Lagos at a seminar on prevention of hijack in Nigeria. (Alhaji 
Ibrahim) explained that due to the absence of such legal 
instruments, the Authority had to rely on other government 
agencies to perform some of its statutory functions. [passage
