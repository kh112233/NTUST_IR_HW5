THE WORLD 
Black South African activist Winnie Mandela, the wife of jailed African 
National Congress leader Nelson R. Mandela, joined in beating some boys 
allegedly abducted by her unofficial bodyguards, a major Johannesburg newspaper 
reported. It was the first published report asserting that Mandela herself 
participated in the alleged beating. The Sunday Star, a newspaper that opposes 
apartheid, said she whipped four boys brought to her house in Soweto last month 
by young men loyal to her who call themselves the Mandela United soccer club. 
One of the boys, 14-year-old Stompie Mokhetsi, is missing and feared dead. The 
report deepened the controversy surrounding Mandela, who has denied any 
wrongdoing.
