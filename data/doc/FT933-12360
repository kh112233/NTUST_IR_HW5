FT  24 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Iraq and
Opec give oil the jitters
THE OIL market has been jittery as it looked for something concrete to
emerge from talks between Iraq and the United Nations as well as for some
direction from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Expectations that Iraq would be allowed to return to the oil market, albeit
with limited sales, knocked prices down to Dollars 15.98 a barrel early on
Monday - the lowest level since the Gulf War in 1991. But an announcement
from Opec of an emergency meeting to be held next Wednesday in Vienna pushed
prices back up to Dollars 16.71 by the end of the day.
On Wednesday Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, said Opec was
facing its worst crisis since 1986, when prices fell from Dollars 30 to
Dollars 15 a barrel in a few days after excess production. Since May this
year oil has fallen by Dollars 3 a barrel because of over-production by Opec
members and the threat of Iraq's return to the market.
But on Thursday Mr Jean Ping, Opec president, postponed next week's
emergency meeting until at least the second week of August. He explained
that the organisation had not had enough time for proper consultations. The
Brent September price slipped back to Dollars 16.50 a barrel.
Opec members are already producing between 24.3m and 24.5m barrels a day
compared with their own ceiling of 23.6m b/d set at their last meeting in
early June. The market feared that Iraq was close to a deal with the UN to
allow it to supply Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil - between 500,000 and 600,000
b/d - over six months.
Yesterday the market recovered some of Thursday's losses. The talks between
Iraq and the UN were seen as unlikely to resume until next week. Until the
outcome of the talks is known, there is little point in Opec making any
decisions.
The London Metal Exchange this week described a rise of 46 per cent in its
turnover for 1992 as 'heartening,' since the base metals industry had
suffered more than most in what had proved to be a difficult trading year.
The difficulties have continued this year, particularly for tin and nickel
which have hit 20-year and six-year lows respectively this week.
Three-month nickel crashed through the Dollars 5,000 a tonne barrier on
Tuesday as stocks in LME warehouses rose by 1,332 tonnes to a new record of
97,104 tonnes.
This reversed the recent draw-down which took LME stocks from 96,000 tonnes
to 85,476 tonnes at the beginning of the month. In the first half of the
year the nickel market saw strong consumption by the stainless steel
industry, tight supplies of stainless steel scrap and less metal exported
from the CIS.
Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group, said that things had now turned round completely, with
exports from the CIS resuming just as stainless steel scrap was becoming
readily available. 'The downward pressure will be maintained. We are heading
for 100,000 tonnes of stocks this autumn,' he said.
Yesterday LME warehouse stocks of nickel rose by a further 1,920 tonnes. The
three-month price closed at Dollars 4,910 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 157.50
on the week.
Coincidentally three-month tin also crashed through Dollars 5,000 a tonne
this week, taking the price well below most mines' production costs. The
move came on Wednesday, after the price hit a record low of MDollars 12.50
in Kuala Lumpur. Traders blamed selling from China and Brazil, the high
level of stocks and lack of consumer interest. In addition Vietnam has
emerged as a seller recently, and scrap is coming out of Russia.
Three-month tin closed yesterday at Dollars 4,945 a tonne, down Dollars
97.50 on the week. At the beginning of the year it was above Dollars 6,000 a
tonne.
Stocks in LME warehouses are about 120 tonnes off recent highs at 20,395
tonnes. But worldwide stocks are thought to be about 40,000 tonnes, the
highest level since 1986 and equivalent to about 12 weeks' consumption.
Mr Fidelis Madavo, analyst with Commodities Research Unit, suggested that
the price could now force some weak producers to call it a day. Only then
could the market form a base.
Gold managed to end the week above Dollars 390 a troy ounce after testing
support at Dollars 388 on Thursday on the London bullion market. It closed
yesterday at Dollars 390.50, down Dollars 3 in the week.
Dealers said this price level reflected diminishing hopes for a test of
Dollars 400 on the current swing.
Robusta coffee prices have held up well following the disappearance of the
Brazilian frost scare. September coffee closed yesterday at Dollars 992 a
tonne, up Dollars 15 on the week.
The growing credibility of the Latin American coffee retention scheme is
behind the relative strength of the market, analysts said. This week
Colombia and Central American countries said after a meeting in Guatemala
City that they had sufficient controls to implement the scheme from October,
while eight African countries, including the Ivory Coast, Uganda and Kenya,
are thought to be ready to join it.
Next week the Latin American producers meet in Rio de Janeiro to thrash out
the rules for the scheme, which aims to withhold 20 per cent of their coffee
exports from the market. If the Africans join them, the new Association of
Coffee Producing Countries will represent more than 64 per cent of world
production.
