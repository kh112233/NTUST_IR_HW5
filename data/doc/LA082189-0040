IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
OCEAN ALGAE EXTRACT SHOWS AIDS PROMISE 
Researchers from the National Cancer Institute report that four fatty 
substances found in common ocean algae protected cells of the human immune 
system against attack by the AIDS virus. The extracts, called sulfolipids, come 
from the membranes of chlorophyll-containing cells and are found in many 
plants, algae and micro-organisms. Their viral-fighting ability had not been 
known before and was discovered in the cancer institute's program to screen 
substances for potential AIDS-fighting ability, the researchers reported in 
last week's Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 
The NCI tests could not show how the sulfolipids protected against the human 
immunodeficiency virus, the team said, and compounds with similar chemical 
structures gave no protection against the virus. Because of the urgency for 
identification and testing of new anti-AIDS drugs, the NCI has selected the 
sulfolipid class as a high priority for further investigation, the scientists 
said.
