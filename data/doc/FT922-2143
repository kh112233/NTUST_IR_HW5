FT  18 JUN 92 / Doubts in Prague on federation
THE CRISIS shaking the Czechoslovak federation intensified yesterday when Mr
Vaclav Klaus, federal prime minister designate, announced he would head his
own Czech republic instead.
Mr Klaus, who as federal finance minister masterminded post-communist
reforms, was charged by President Vaclav Havel with forming a new federal
government after his party won greatest support in this month's elections.
Meeting newly elected Slovak leaders for a third round of negotiations, Mr
Klaus said he did not 'put much faith in a new federal state'.
The future of the Czechoslovak federation has been put into question since
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) won 37 per cent of the vote in
the Slovak republic. The nationalist HZDS has pledged to declare Slovak
sovereignty and adopt a Slovak constitution in the republic's new parliament
when it meets at the end of the month.
The two sides agreed yesterday to form a minimal federal government but
remained deadlocked over the division of ministerial posts within it.
