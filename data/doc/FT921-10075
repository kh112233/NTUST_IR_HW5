FT  08 FEB 92 / Drugs industry declares record trade surplus
THE pharmaceutical industry had a record trade surplus last year of Pounds
1.17bn, according to the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.
The figure represented an increase of 6.7 per cent on the previous year.
Exports grew by 12.8 per cent to Pounds 2.54bn while imports increased by
18.5 per cent to Pounds 1.37bn.
The figures will support the industry's arguments for maintaining the
present pricing structure, which encourages investment.
The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme, which ends in November, fixes a
cap on the return on equity employed by companies. By investing in research
and development or manufacturing in the UK, pharmaceuticals groups are
allowed, under the scheme, to charge higher prices.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health minister, said last month that she intended
to create an open and competitive market providing safe and effective
medicines at an acceptable cost to the taxpayer. She added that she
recognised the important position of the pharmaceutical industry in
continuing research.
