FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Zeneca drug strengthens place in cancer
market
Zeneca has submitted for approval a new drug that is likely to affect
profits growth within two or three years.
Casodex is a treatment for prostate cancer that is estimated by Lehman
Brothers, the stockbrokers, to have potential sales of between Dollars 250m
and Dollars 500m (Pounds 323m) a year. That would make it Zeneca's
third-biggest seller.
The drug is an oral anti-androgen. About 300,000 new prostate cancer cases
are reported each year worldwide, making it the second most common cancer in
men.
Approval for the drug is being sought first in the UK. Submissions to
regulatory authorities in the rest of the European Union and in the US will
follow by the end of the year, and it is likely to reach the market in 1995.
Other companies making or developing anti-androgens include Schering Plough
and Johnson &amp; Johnson of the US.
Casodex's approval would place Zeneca more firmly in the cancer market. It
already has Nolvadex and Zoladex in the area, but both are outsold by heart
treatments Zestril and Tenormin.
