BUNDLE OF BABES IS GIFT OF THE '80S 
An Alameda couple became parents of test-tube quadruplets on the last day of 
the 1980s. Ted and Maria Lusignan, who had been trying to have a baby for six 
years, now have three girls and a boy born in four minutes. The babies, 10 
weeks premature and ranging in weight from 2 pounds, 12 ounces to 1 pound, were 
in stable condition in Alta Bates Hospital's intensive care unit.
