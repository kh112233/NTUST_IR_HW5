SOUTHLAND; 
KILLER ESCAPES WOMEN'S PRISON 
A woman serving a maximum life sentence for killing her husband in 1984 escaped 
from the California Institution for Women at Frontera near Chino, apparently 
after a visit with her father, authorities said today. 
Jeanette Hughes, 36, was discovered missing about 9 p.m. Sunday, when visiting 
hours ended, said Ross Dykes, associate warden at the women's prison. 
Prison officials searched the open visiting room, Hughes' housing facility and 
checked the prison grounds with dogs before determining about midnight that she 
was not inside the facility's boundaries. 
Hughes, formerly of Huntington Beach, was sentenced in 1986 to 26 years to life 
for the slaying two years earlier of her husband, James.
