WAITE, 2 OTHERS MAY BE FREED 
Senior Muslim sources said today that three British hostages held in Lebanon, 
including Anglican church envoy Terry Waite, will be freed this month. 
"If all goes well, John McCarthy, Jack Mann and Terry Waite will be released in 
September," a senior Muslim official told Reuters. 
The report was confirmed by a senior pro-Iranian source in Beirut. 
"High-level contacts between the British and the Iranian governments have 
reached their final stages and the release of the hostages would be the fruit 
of these talks," the Muslim official said.
