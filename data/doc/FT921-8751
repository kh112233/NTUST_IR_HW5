FT  15 FEB 92 / Gardening: Plant of the week - Brunfelsia pauciflora
This small evergreen shrub from Brazil is difficult to find in nurseries but
sometimes turns up in the house plant section of garden centres. It has
blue-purple flowers rather like those of the big periwinkle and they come
more or less continuously from winter until summer. Not a great many are
produced at any one time, which possibly is why botanists call it
'pauciflora', which means 'with few flowers,' but its long season and its
good foliage make ample amends for this lack of a big display.
This is an easy-going plant which will grow in any good peat or soil compost
in large pots, tubs, or a bed of soil and with a minimum temperature of 13`C
(55`F) if winter flowers are required. The plant will survive so long as it
does not freeze. It used to be called Brunfelsia calycina and may still be
found under this name.
