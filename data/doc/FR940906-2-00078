SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The National Science Foundation, as directed by the Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95541),
has developed regulations that implement the ``Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora''
for all United States citizens. The Agreed Measures, developed by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties, recommended
establishment of a permit system for various activities in Antarctica and designation of certain animals and certain
geographic areas a requiring special protection. The regulations establish such a permit system to designate Specially
Protected Areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest.



The applications received are as follows:

2. 

Applicant


E. Imre Friedmann, Department of Biological Science and Polar Desert Research Center, Florida State University,
Tallahassee, Florida 323062043


Activity for Which Permit is Requested


Take. Enter Site of Special Scientific Interest. Import into the U.S.


The applicant proposes to collect rock samples containing living and/or fossil microbial colonizations to study
extinction and/or damage due to environmental factors. This is part of a major survey extending throughout the McMurdo
Dry Valleys area. Hand specimens of rocks will be collected from the ground or removed, if necessary, by geological
hammer. As many as 25 samples will be collected; the samples will not weigh more than 3 pounds each. Some samples will
be collected in Linnaeus Terrace (SSSI 

#

19). Entry to the site, camping and sample collection will be in accordance with the Management Plan for SSSI 

#

19 to ensure environmental impact will be reduced to the absolute minimum necessary to complete the research. Specimens
will be examined and stored frozen in the Antarctic Core Library of Florida State University.

5. 

Applicant


Colin M. Harris, International Centre for Antarctic, Information and Research, P.O. Box 14199, Christchurch,
NEW ZEALAND


Activities for Which Permit is Requested


Enter Specially Protected Areas and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The applicant proposes to enter Beufort
Island (SPA 

#

5), Cape Hallett (SPA 

#

7), Cape Royds (SSSI 

#

1), Arrival Heights (SSSI 

#

2), Barwick Valley (SSSI 

#

3), Cape Crozier (SSSI 

#

4), North West White Island (SSSI 

#

18) and Linnaeus Terrace (SSSI 

#

19) in continuation of a joint U.S./N.Z. project to review management plans for protected areas in the Ross Sea region.
At each site the 34 person team will describe and map geographical features, including important natural and
historical features, evidence of human modifications, structures, markers, impacts, landing and access points
and paths; document natural or human features of special significance; describe scientific work being conducted
in the area, its effects and influences; assess whether the area is continuing to serve the purpose for which it was
designated, including re-assessment of boundaries and management objectives; and, use GPS to map boundaries and
define designated photo points covering the most important features of the site as practical. Access to the sites
will primarily be by helicopter, but may be on foot or by vehicle or ship, as appropriate. Access will comply with existing
management plan provisions for each site.
