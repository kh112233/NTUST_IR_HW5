VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA; 
2 PAINTINGS STOLEN FROM HOTEL DISPLAY 
Two paintings valued at $1,000 were stolen during an Agoura woman's first solo 
art show, at a Ventura hotel. 
Artist Carol Merrick said she discovered earlier this week that two paintings 
were missing from among 37 on display at the Doubletree Hotel. The paintings 
were not insured and Merrick is offering a $100 reward for their return. 
Police were investigating the theft. Merrick said the disappearance of her 
paintings forced her to close the show. JEFF SCHNAUFER
