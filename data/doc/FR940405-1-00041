 

But such susceptibility is common and adverse effects can arise suddenly following exposure. The relevant effects
can be categorized into six categories: irritation, pulmonary, cardiovascular, nervous system, reproductive,
and cancer. 
Common chemical sense or irritation perception is mediated through receptors found not only throughout the nasal,
pharyngeal, and laryngeal areas of the respiratory system but also on the surface of the eyes, specifically the conjunctiva
and cornea [Ex. 4239]. It is partially through the stimulation of these receptors that exposed persons perceive
irritation. Many comments to the docket, from citizens, researchers, and indoor air consultants, raised the issue
about the irritating effects related to known indoor air contaminants. The air contaminants of concern include formaldehyde
[Exs. 314, 332, 338, 3188, 3440a, 3446, 3575, 4125, 4144,
4214], volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [Exs. 332, 3446, 3500, 4145, 4243,
4320], ozone [Exs. 314, 442, 4134, 4236, 4237], carpet-associated chemicals
[Exs. 325, 3444D, 3576, 4144, 4214], vehicle exhausts [Exs. 36, 363,
3206, 3238, 3360, 3437, 3444D, 3631, 3659], combustion gases [Ex.
332], particulates [Exs. 332, 3446, 3500], man-made mineral fibers (fiberglass, glasswool
and rockwool) [Ex. 433], and pesticides [Ex. 3446]. 
The irritation effects present as sensory irritation of the skin and upper airways, irritation of eye, nose and throat,
dry mucous membranes, erythema, headache, and abnormal taste [Ex. 314, 433]. The pulmonary effects
include upper and lower respiratory tract effects such as rapid breathing, fatigue, increased infection rate, broncho-constriction,
pulmonary edema, asthma, allergies and flu-like symptoms. Acute exposure to low level of air contaminants results
in primarily reversible effects, while chronic exposure may result in pulmonary fibrosis that can result in irreversible
damage [Exs. 314, 433]. 
These health effects were associated, as reported in many comments to the docket, with specific contaminants, including
asbestos [Exs. 338, 3440A, 3500], combustion gases [Exs. 314, 334, 3440A,
3446, 3500], formaldehyde [Exs. 332, 338, 3188, 3440A, 4124], ozone
[Exs. 442, 4237], VOCs [Ex. 332], vehicular exhaust [Ex. 363], and particulates [Exs.
332, 338, 3440A, 3500]. 
Individuals with underlying pulmonary disease, such as asthma, are more susceptible than others to acute exposure
to these indoor air contaminants and experience coughing and wheezing at low levels of exposure. Synergism may occur
between chemical contaminants, such as ozone and VOCs, in aggravating asthma [Ex. 433]. These affected individuals
may also be at increased risk of pulmonary infections due to the synergistic effect between chemical and microbial
contaminants [Ex. 433]. 
Cardiovascular effects have also been associated with poor indoor air quality. These effects are presented as headache,
fatigue, dizziness, aggravation of existing cardiovascular disease, and damage to the heart. These effects are
associated with exposure to combustion gases such as carbon monoxide [Exs. 338, 3440A], VOCs [Ex. 3500],
and particulates [Ex. 3500]. 
Nervous system effects have also been produced due to exposure to poor indoor air quality. These effects include headache,
blurred vision, fatigue, malaise with nausea, ringing in the ears, impaired judgement, and polyneuritis. These
effects are associated with exposure to carbon dioxide [Ex. 314], carbon monoxide [Exs. 332, 338,
3446, 3500], formaldehyde [Exs. 332, 338, 3446, 3500], and VOCs [Exs. 332,
3446, 3500]. 
Relevant reproductive effects include menstrual irregularities and birth defects and are associated with exposure
to formaldehyde [Exs. 3446, 3500] and VOCs [Exs. 3446, 3500]. 
The occurrence of cancer has also been attributed to exposures associated with poor indoor air quality. In particular,
cancer of the lung, including mesothelioma, esophagus, stomach, and colon have been associated with exposure to
asbestos [Exs. 36, 314, 338, 3188, 3440A, 3500], radon [Exs. 335,
338, 3188, 3440A, 3500], vehicular exhausts [Exs. 384, 3206, 3360H],
combustion gases [Ex. 3500], VOCs [Exs. 3446, 3500, 4294], and particulates [Ex. 3500].



2. Microbial Contamination 


Building-related illnesses can result in serious illness and death. Indoor transmission of disease caused by obligate
pathogens (microbes that require a living host) is common in indoor environments, especially those that are overcrowded
and inadequately ventilated [Ex. 433]. Diseases in this category include influenza, rhinovirus or colds,
and measles. Indoor transmission of disease caused by opportunistic microorganisms usually affects compromised
individuals, those with existing conditions that make them more susceptible to infection, such as pulmonary disease
or immunodeficiency. Legionnaires' disease, pulmonary tract infections, and humidifier fever are diseases that
fall into this category. Diseases that affect the immune system include allergic reactions, as seen in antibody-mediated
responses (asthma and rhinitis) and interstitial lung disease, as seen in cell-mediated reactions (hypersensitivity
pneumonitis) [Ex. 433]. All of these diseases produce substantial amounts of illness each year [Exs. 433,
441, 4214].
 
In the U.S., Legionnaires' disease is considered to be a fairly common, serious form of pneumonia. The 

Legionella

 bacterium is one of the top three bacterial agents in the U.S. which causes sporadic community-acquired pneumonia.
Because of the difficulty in clinically distinguishing this disease from other forms of pneumonia, many cases go
unreported. Although approximately 1,000 cases are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention annually,
it has been estimated that over 25,000 cases of the illness actually occur. This disease burden is estimated to result
in over 5,000 to 7,000 deaths per year [Ex. 441]. Brooks et al. [Ex. 433] reported that as many as 116,000
cases occur each year. Of these cases, it is estimated that between 35,000 and 40,000 die. The attack rate for 

L. pneumophila 

ranges from 0.1 to 5%. The case fatality rate ranges from 15 to 20% [Ex. 4214]. 
Two serious allergic or hypersensitivity diseases are asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic
alveolitis). An estimated 3% of the U.S. population suffers from asthma (approximately 9,000,000 people) [Ex. 441].
These individuals may be more susceptible to bioaerosol contamination or chemical contamination of the indoor environment.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is triggered by recurrent exposure to microbials, fumes, vapors, and dusts [Ex. 433].
The lung interstitium, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli react in an inflammatory process that can organize into
granulomas and progress to fibrosis. The symptoms of acute episodes of this disease are malaise, fever, chills, cough
and dyspnea. The symptoms of chronic episodes are serious respiratory symptoms such as progressive dyspnea. Chronic
disease can lead to irreversible pulmonary structural and functional changes [Ex. 433].
