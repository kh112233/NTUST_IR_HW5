SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated September 13, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the
authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 

et seq.

), as follows:



I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of California, resulting from the continuing effects
of the warm water currents known as El Nino on the 1994 Coho salmon fishing season on May 1, 1994, through October 31,
1994, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration under the Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, therefore, declare that such a major disaster
exists in the State of California. 
You are authorized to provide Disaster Employment Assistance in the designated areas. In order to provide Federal
assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes, such amounts as you find
necessary for Disaster Unemployment Assistance and administrative expenses in the designated areas.



The time period prescribed for the implementation of section 310(a), Priority to Certain Applications for Public
Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 U.S.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date
of this declaration.
Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint Mark Duggan of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act as the
Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster. 
I do hereby determine the following areas of the State of California to have been affected adversely by this declared
major disaster:



The counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Mendocino and Sonoma for Disaster Unemployment Assistance only.
