FT  25 FEB 92 / Elected Welsh assembly gains favour
WALES appears to be following in the footsteps of Scotland and moving
towards increased support for an elected assembly with devolved powers along
the lines advocated by the Labour party.
A poll commissioned by the Western Mail newspaper in conjunction with S4C,
the Welsh fourth TV channel, indicated 47 per cent favoured an elected
assembly with only 31 per cent against and 21 per cent dont-knows.
The poll, which was conducted by NOP, found that the creation of a Scottish
assembly would increase support for devolution for Wales to 61 per cent with
24 per cent against and 14 per cent don't knows. In the 1979 referendum on
devolution, when the vote was four-to-one against an assembly.
