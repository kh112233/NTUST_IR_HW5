FT  28 SEP 93 / World Bank boosts 'green' loans
THE growing importance of environmental issues in developing nations was
underscored yesterday by the disclosure that the World Bank nearly doubled
its lending for environmental protection to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in
its business year to the end of June.
In its fourth annual report covering its environmental activities, the bank
said it approved loans of Dollars 1.3bn for pollution control and the
protection of the urban environment, Dollars 521m for natural resources
management and Dollars 173m to help build up institutions to protect the
environment in developing nations.
The 23 projects approved last year represented a 30-fold increase in the
value of bank lending for the environment compared with five years ago.
The Bank's so-called 'brown agenda', covering pollution control and urban
projects, included large projects for the control of water pollution in
Brazil, China, South Korea and Turkey and air pollution control projects in
India and Mexico.
Lending for natural resources and the rural environment (the Bank's 'green
agenda') included projects for water resource and land conservation and
management in Egypt, India, Pakistan and Turkey and for natural habitat
protection in Egypt, Gabon, the Seychelles, Tunisia and Venezuela.
The Bank's report makes clear that its rapid advance in a new area of
activity is not without risk.
While studies so far suggest that the performance of its environmental
projects is about the same as or slightly better than the bank's overall
portfolio, the report noted that most of the projects are still young.
'It is clear that strong efforts will be required to ensure the portfolio of
environmental projects performs well,' it said.
