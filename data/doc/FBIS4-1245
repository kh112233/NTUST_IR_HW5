  [Text] At least four people are now known to have been 
killed and 18 injured in this morning's powerful car bomb 
explosion in central Johannesburg. 
  The explosion occurred in Bree Street near the regional 
offices of the ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], and 
the ANC's national headquarters. Regional ANC spokesman Obed 
Bapela has said a senior ANC official was among those killed. 
He said there were about 200 MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, Spear of 
the Nation -- ANC military wing] members in the ANC's regional 
offices when the bomb went off. The police say the bomb, of 
between 70 and 90 kilograms, had apparently been planted in or 
under a car parked at the corner of Bree and Von Wielligh 
Streets. 
  Neighboring buildings were extensively damaged and numerous 
windows were blown out. After the explosion people scattered in 
all directions. A sizable crowd began gathering near the scene 
of the blast but dispersed peacefully after being addressed by 
Mr. Carl Niehaus of the ANC. Troops were called in to help 
patrol the area which had been cordoned off by the police 
shortly after the blast. 
  Police sniffer dogs are being used to comb the area for more 
bombs.
