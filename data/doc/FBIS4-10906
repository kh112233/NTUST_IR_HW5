  [Text] San Jose, 19 Apr (DPA) -- Costa Rica will insist the 
U.S. Government accept the extradition of John Hull, a fugitive 
from local justice. Hull was charged with involvement in 
"hostile actions," allegedly drug trafficking, and a bloody 
attack in which several journalists were killed in 1984. 
  President Rafael Angel Calderon made these statements after 
learning of a news report from Managua stating the U.S. citizen 
has been in Nicaragua for two months. 
  The U.S. citizen is also facing charges of alleged homicide 
[homicidio calificado] and attempted homicide. 
  According to Costa Rican political sectors, Hull, who owns a 
farm in northern Costa Rica, near Nicaragua, was reportedly 
involved in the La Penca attack 10 years ago, in which several 
journalists and guerrillas of the anti-Sandinist group, then led 
by Eden Pastora, were killed. 
  Hull has denied the charges, saying he is a victim of 
"communists." 
  Hull fled Costa Rica five years ago after police arrested 
him.
