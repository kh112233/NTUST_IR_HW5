FT  19 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Putting drivers in a better
light
German researchers have developed a technique to help car drivers dazzled by
the sun and blinded by the headlights of on-coming traffic. The
electrochrome glazing process developed by Dornier, a subsidiary of Deutsche
Aerospace, will allow a driver to filter out light at the press of a button.
The technique involves coating glass with a layer of ultra-thin material,
which alters its chemical composition, colour and light permeability when a
voltage is applied. The filter lasts until the voltage is discharged.
