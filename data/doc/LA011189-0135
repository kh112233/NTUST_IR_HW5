SUSPECT CAUGHT BY A DOG SLIPS LEASH ON POLICE 
A robbery suspect who couldn't elude a police dog managed to escape from his 
human captors Tuesday while being treated for dog bites at a hospital, Santa 
Ana police said. 
Eric Moore had been captured under a house on West Cubbon Street by a police 
dog after Alfredo Torrez, 36, flagged down officers and said two men had taken 
his wallet and two gold rings, according to Maureen Thomas, a police 
spokeswoman. 
Moore, who was bitten several times during his capture, was taken to Western 
Medical Center at about 4:30 a.m., where he disappeared. 
"We're investigating how he got away," Thomas said. "Some of our officers were 
present, but he managed to escape at some point when being examined for his 
bite injuries." 
A 17-year-old boy arrested with Moore was also treated for dog bites and taken 
to Juvenile Hall.
