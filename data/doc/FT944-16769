FT  12 OCT 94 / Disabled fail to take up benefit for job searches
A social security benefit launched more than two years ago to help disabled
people find jobs has attracted only a fraction of the claimants the
government expected.
At the time of its launch in April 1992, ministers said they expected about
50,000 people to claim the Disability Working Allowance. A report by the
independent Policy Studies Institute, published today, however, shows that
only 4,300 people are receiving the benefit.
The report said that while 250,000 disabled people are thought to be looking
for work, only a few hundred had moved into work as a direct result of the
allowance and only about a third of those hoping to find work had heard of
the allowance.
It estimated a sixth of those eligible were actually receiving the benefit.
Most of those who had obtained it, were already in work before they heard of
it - a means-tested top-up benefit similar to Income Support.
Another problem was that most disabled people wanted to work full-time,
whereas the allowance mainly helped part-timers.
The researchers also found that some disabled workers were earning too much
to come within the scope of the benefit. Single people earning more than
Pounds 108 can no longer claim benefit. The rules also favour people who
claim soon after finding a job.
Ms Karen Rowlingson, co-author of the report, said: 'The Disability Working
Allowance has helped a few disabled people find jobs. But this is just the
tip of the iceberg compared with the number who want to work.'
The study was based on a postal survey of 7,000 people on sickness or
disability benefits, interviews with 1,500 workers and 1,000 allowance
claimants.
The Department of Social Security said it would study the report. It added:
'The benefit was only introduced in 1992. It will take time to be accepted.'
