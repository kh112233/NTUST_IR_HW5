REP. ROHRABACHER ON COLD FUSION 
In defending cold-fusion chemists Pons and Fleischmann as brave challengers of 
the status quo, Rohrabacher misses the point of much of the criticism against 
them. Most scientists were excited by the reports of cold fusion, and frankly, 
a bit amused that two chemists working on their own could tweak the tail of the 
giant federal labs. What really bothered most critics is that after Pons and 
Fleischmann announced their claims in a press conference, they were so busy 
talking to reporters and testifying before Congress they had no time to publish 
their results in a scientific journal or defend them in scientific meetings. 
Good science only emerges through the intense scrutiny of vigorous debate. Pons 
and Fleischmann shied from this test. When Copernicus and Galileo kept their 
theories to themselves, what they feared was persecution from the government 
(actually, the church, the same thing in those days), not criticism from other 
scientists. For Pons and Fleischmann, it was the reverse. They sought the 
refuge of reporters and politicians to avoid the scrutiny of their scientific 
peers.
