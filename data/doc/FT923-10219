FT  31 JUL 92 / Saddam makes key changes in cabinet
IRAQI President Saddam Hussein made key changes in his cabinet yesterday,
sacking his finance minister and moving the foreign minister to the finance
job, agencies report from Baghdad.
Diplomats attributed the dismissal of finance minister Majeed Abed Jaafar to
Iraq's grave economic problems under UN sanctions, still in place 17 months
after the army was driven from Kuwait.
The sanctions have blocked oil sales abroad, Iraq's main source of income.
The country also has high inflation and a crisis over forged banknotes.
Foreign minister Ahmed Hussein al-Samaraei, who entered the cabinet after
the Gulf war, takes over the Finance Ministry even though he has held no
previous economic post. He rose through the military branch of the ruling
Ba'ath Party and was formerly an ambassador. His move from the Foreign
Ministry follows criticism of his handling of Iraq's latest confrontation
with the United Nations over weapons inspections, according to Associated
Press.
Michael Littlejohns adds from the UN in New York: Iraqi forces using heavy
artillery have attacked civilian targets in Shia villages in the southern
part of the country and committed 'massive human rights violations',
according to reports the UN believes are reliable. Mr Max van der Stoel,
special representative of the UN human rights commission, appealed to
Baghdad to end 'intentionally repressive policies'.
