Addition of One Genetically Engineered Tomato Line to Determination of 
Nonregulated Status for Calgene, Inc. 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is announcing that it 
has added one genetically engineered tomato line to those subject to its 
October 19, 1992, interpretive ruling for FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes, that the subject FLAVR SAVR

TM

 lines need no longer be regulated. The effect of this 
action is that one additional delayed-softening tomato line, which has been 
modified by the addition of genetic material identical to that added to other 
tomato lines covered by the initial determination and is designated by Calgene 
as FLAVR SAVR

TM

 line N73 1436111, will also no longer be subject to regulation 
under 7 CFR part 340.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 19, 1992, the Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS) published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 4760847616, Docket No. 920872) a notice announcing the issuance of an interpretive ruling
that the Calgene, Inc., FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato does not 
present a plant pest risk and is not a regulated article under the regulations 
contained in 7 CFR part 340. That action was in response to a petition 
submitted by Calgene seeking a determination from APHIS that its FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato no longer be deemed a regulated article based on an absence of plant pest risk. The effect of the action was that
previously field-tested lines of the FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato and their descendants would no longer be regulated under the regulations in 7 CFR part 340. 


FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes were defined by Calgene in its initial petition to include any tomatoes transformed with one of seven identified
plasmid vectors that all carry an antisense copy of the tomato polygalacturonase gene and a bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase
gene with associated regulatory sequences. Calgene's initial request to APHIS in 1992 was for a determination pertaining
to all FLAVR SAVR

TM

 transformants produced in tomato using any one 
of the seven plasmid vectors. Calgene indicated in its petition that data 
provided to APHIS was representative of the data gathered for all lines tested 
up to that time. The initial determination announced by APHIS on October 19, 
1992, only applied to those lines that had already been field tested. 
However, APHIS indicated that new lines were likely to exhibit properties 
similar to those of lines already field tested under permit. The 
determination also allowed for cross-breeding of the identified FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato lines with any other lines or cultivars of tomato without permit. 
The new line that is the subject of this notice was a new transformant 
produced using one of the same plasmid vectors that were previously reviewed 
in our October 19, 1992, determination. Line N73 1436111 has been field 
tested in accordance with APHIS regulations in 7 CFR part 340. Data provided 
to APHIS indicates that the new transformant line, produced in a manner 
identical to the earlier transformant lines, behaves similarly to those 
earlier FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato lines to which the determination initially applied. Reports from field trials and other data indicate that
tomato line N73 1436111 grows normally, exhibits the expected morphological, reproductive, and physiological
properties, and does not have unexpected pest or disease susceptibility or symptoms. Therefore, APHIS' determination
of nonregulated status of October 19, 1992, is considered to apply to this new transformant line as well.




Done in Washington, DC, this 27th day of September 1994.
