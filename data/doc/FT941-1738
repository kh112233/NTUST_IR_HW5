FT  24 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Tokyo suicide warning over drugs
Japan's ministry of health and welfare yesterday warned that alpha
interferons, drugs developed to treat hepatitis and cancer, could cause
depression and exacerbate suicidal tendencies. It said 32 people taking the
drug between July 1987 and December 1993 had attempted suicide and 12 of
them had died.
The announcement is another serious blow for the Japanese pharmaceutical
industry. Interferons were one of fastest growing sectors last year in what
was otherwise a lacklustre Japanese drugs market.
The stocks of Japanese companies marketing alpha interferons fell sharply.
Takeda shares fell Y40 to Y1,250. Baring Securities estimates its interferon
generated sales of Y30bn (Pounds 190m) last year.
Sumitomo Chemical, which markets interferon under licence from Wellcome of
the UK and achieved sales of about Y48bn, fell Y11 to Y464. Yamanouchi
shares dropped Y20 to Y2,050.
The news is also a setback for foreign drug companies. The world alpha
interferon market was worth about Dollars 1.5bn last year, of which most was
in Japan. Those affected include Schering-Plough of the US, whose drug
achieved sales in Japan of Y30bn last year.
