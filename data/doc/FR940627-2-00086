<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), seeks licensee(s) who can
effectively pursue the preclinical, clinical and commercial development of transforming growth factor_beta (TGF-beta).
In an earlier notice (

Federal Register

 Vol. 58, No. 166 pages 454945, August 30, 1993) NIH had announced that several fields of use for TGF-beta were
available for licensing. Since this time, two additional fields of use have become available for non-exclusive licensing:
1) the nonsystemic administration of TGF-beta for repair of soft tissue; and 2) the systemic administration of TGF-beta
for treatment or prevention of vascular ischemia and/or reperfusion injury. The following patents and patent applications
covering TGF-beta are available to be licensed: U.S. Patent 5,104,977 entitled ``Purified Transforming Growth
Factor Beta,'' U.S. patent application 08/048,956 entitled ``Promotion of Cell Proliferation by Use of Transforming
Growth Factor Beta,'' and foreign counterpart applications claiming priority from U.S. patent applications 06/468,590
and 06/500,833 both entitled ``Repair of Tissue in Animals.'' The patent rights in these inventions have been assigned
to the United States of America.

 

</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The NIH seeks licensee(s), who in accordance with requirements and regulations governing the licensing of government-owned
inventions (37 CFR part 404), have the most meritorious plan for the development of TGF-beta to a marketable status
to meet the needs of the public and with the best terms for the NIH. The criteria that NIH will use to evaluate license
applications will include, but not be limited to those set forth by 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(ii)(iv).
