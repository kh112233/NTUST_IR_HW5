FT  03 JUN 93 / Winnie Mandela avoids jail term
SOUTH AFRICA'S Appeal Court yesterday set aside a six-year jail term for Mrs
Winnie Mandela, the estranged wife of African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, although it upheld her conviction for kidnapping.
The court amended the penalty to a R15,000 (Pounds 3,025) fine or one year
in prison, and a two-year term conditionally suspended for five years. It
dismissed her original conviction on a charge of accessory to assault on
four black youths at her home in Soweto.
The decision is likely to defuse potential trouble among young black
supporters during South Africa's transition to democracy. But criminal
experts said it appeared an unusually light sentence for kidnapping.
Mrs Mandela was originally convicted and sentenced in May 1991 to five
years' imprisonment on four counts of kidnapping and one year as an
accessory to assault.
The Appeal Court also ordered her to pay compensation of R5,000 each to the
three surviving victims of the 1989 kidnappings and assaults. The body of a
fourth victim, 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, was found in a field in January
1989.
Mr Justice Corbett, the chief justice, said that he believed a substantial
fine, suspended sentence and payment of compensation to the victims was a
fit punishment which would also achieve a measure of 'social justice'.
Mrs Mandela's estranged husband said yesterday, after meeting President F W
de Klerk, that the ANC and government were very close to agreement on a date
for the first all-race elections. It was their second meeting this week. Mr
Mandela told reporters the two sides had made substantial progress on
constitutional issues. Mr de Klerk concurred, saying: 'We are doing our
level best to ensure progress in the negotiation process. We have worked
around the clock. . . and we will continue to work until we reach the moment
where further progress can be registered.'
