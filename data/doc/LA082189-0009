DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TWO LIVES CLAIMED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS 
Two men were killed and a third was seriously injured in traffic accidents in 
the East San Fernando Valley late Saturday and early Sunday, Los Angeles police 
said. 
The driver of a converted 1965 Volkswagen "Baja Bug" was killed in a head-on 
collision with another car on Sunland Boulevard near Wornom Avenue about 10:30 
p.m. Saturday, said Sgt. Jim Gicking. 
He said the driver of the Volkswagen, whose identity was not released, 
apparently veered into oncoming traffic, striking a 1984 Honda Accord. The man 
had purchased the "Baja Bug" only hours before the accident, Gicking said. 
The driver of the Honda, Michael Thornton, 38, a Sunland teacher, suffered 
broken legs and head and chest injuries and was in critical condition Sunday at 
Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
In a second accident, a pedestrian was killed when he was struck by a 
hit-and-run driver at a Pacoima crosswalk early Sunday, police said. 
Jesse Reyes, 53, was found lying in the middle of Laurel Canyon Boulevard at 
Mercer Street about 1:30 a.m. by a passer-by, Gicking said. He was pronounced 
dead at the scene by paramedics. 
There were no witnesses to the accident, Gicking said.
