DRIVER BURNS TO DEATH IN CAR CRASH; 
5-VEHICLE PILE-UP ON GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY HURTS 4 OTHERS 
A Glendale man was burned to death in a five-car pileup that left four others 
injured this morning and closed the southbound Golden State Freeway in Valencia 
for nearly two hours, the California Highway Patrol said. 
The name of the 41-year-old motorist who died in the 12:05 a.m. accident near 
the Lyons Avenue exit was not released pending notification of his family, the 
CHP said. 
Officer Ralph Elvira said the accident occurred when the Glendale man, driving 
southbound in a Mercedes-Benz, lost control of his car and crashed into the 
freeway's center divider. 
The car rebounded into the second lane of the freeway and came to a stop. Two 
other southbound cars swerved around the Mercedes and also came to a stop, 
Elvira said. Another car could not stop in time and attempted to swerve between 
the stopped cars but hit all three, knocking one of them into a fifth car that 
was driving by. 
The impact caused the Mercedes to burst into flames, and its driver was burned 
to death, Elvira said. 
All southbound lanes of the freeway were closed while the fire was put out and 
the wreckaged was cleared. Elvira said traffic backed up two miles before the 
freeway was reopened shortly before 2 a.m. 
Three drivers and a passenger from the other cars involved in the accident were 
hospitalized. 
Colleen Weeks, 25, of Fresno was in critical condition at Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Newhall, and Jerry Gragnani, 40, of Fresno was in stable 
condition at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, officials said. 
Gragnani's passenger, Anna Sandoval, 34, of Fresno was treated and released 
from Holy Cross, and Francisco Gutierrez, 49, of San Fernando was treated at 
Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia for minor injuries, officials 
said. 
An investigation of the accident is continuing, Elvira said.
