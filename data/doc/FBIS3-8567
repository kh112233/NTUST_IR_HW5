  [Text] Prague, March 9 (CTK) -- There is no other 
possibility than to continue talks concerning joining Sidonia 
(located on the Czech-Slovak border) to the Czech Republic, 
Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus told journalists today. 
  He added that unilateral steps by one or the other side 
would 
not solve the situation. 
  Slovak Interior Minister Jozef Tuchyna told journalists on 
Tuesday that the Slovak Government disagreed with joining the 
settlement of Sidonia, in the village of Horne Srnie, to the 
Czech Republic as has been proposed by the joint Czech-Slovak 
commission dealing with the delimitation of the common border. 
  According to initial recommendations by the two countries' 
interior ministers the settlement U Sabotu should be joined to 
Slovakia and Sidonia to the Czech Republic. Given the fact that 
the Slovak Government yesterday did not approve the commission's 
proposal in its full wording, it is now up to the Czech and 
Slovak governments to solve controversial questions, Tuchyna 
said yesterday. 
  Slovak Government spokesman Ondrej Hanko told journalists 
Tuesday that the government had charged the commission with 
discussing other possibilities of compensation with the Czech 
side.
