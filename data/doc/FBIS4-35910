  [Text] Some 61 Jordanian journalists and writers have sent 
a memorandum of protest to Information Minister Dr. Jawad 
al-'Anani against the Jordanian official media's coverage of 
Yemeni developments. 
  The memorandum said that the coverage is biased and 
contradicts the Jordanian official position and role as a 
sponsor of the accord document. This coverage will also not 
help Jordan to play a role in the future as an honest broker and 
a friend of all Yemeni forces. 
  The memorandum demanded that the official media stop showing 
bias.
