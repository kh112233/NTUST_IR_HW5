SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 4M4428) has been filed by Isomedix, Inc., 11 Apollo Dr., Whippany, NJ 07981. The petition proposes
that the food additive regulations in part 179 

Irradiation in the Production, Processing and Handling of Food

 (21 CFR part 179) be amended to provide for the safe use of sources of ionizing radiation to treat the fresh or frozen
raw edible tissue of domesticated mammalian human food sources for purposes of reduction of parasites and microbial
pathogens, and extension of product shelf-life.


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before September
26, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number

4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will also place on public display any amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's
environmental assessment without further announcement in the 

Federal Register

. If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition
results in a regulation, the notice


of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding will be
published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
