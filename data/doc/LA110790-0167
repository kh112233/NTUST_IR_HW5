SCIENCE; 
COLD FUSION INVESTIGATION BEGINS 
A panel of scientists today began reviewing Utah's National Cold Fusion 
Institute, with a member saying their study of the controversial research would 
be open and objective. 
As the meeting got under way, electrochemist B. Stanley Pons -- who along with 
British colleague Martin Fleischmann claims to have produced nuclear fusion in 
room-temperature experiments -- ducked from television cameras after being 
spotted sitting in the back row. 
All the meetings are closed. A sign posted outside the door of the meeting room 
states: "It is required that only those persons who have signed a National Cold 
Fusion Institute confidentiality agreement attend this review." 
Last year's claim by Pons and Fleischmann that they had created energy through 
so-called "cold fusion" created a sensation in the scientific world. But 
controversy erupted when many other scientists said they could not duplicate 
the Utah scientists' findings.
