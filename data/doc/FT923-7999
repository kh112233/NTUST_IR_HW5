FT  14 AUG 92 / Mexico fails to settle labour dispute at VW
MEXICO'S labour ministry has failed to resolve a company lock-out of more
than 14,000 Volkswagen employees and strikes by some 22,000 textile workers,
prolonging the country's worst labour strife for more than a year.
The lock-out, which began on July 28, is costing VW the equivalent of some
Dollars 5m a day. The company is seeking to cancel its collective contract
with the union, after dissident workers went on strike. These appear to be
backed by many, if not all, of the union members. They say they were not
given details of a new labour contract, which introduces Japanese-style work
groups and quality control to the plant.
VW's Mexican operation produced more than 200,000 cars last year, and is the
leading seller in the Mexican market.
The company is is encouraging some German 40 parts and components suppliers
to operate in Mexico, to help it meet new rules of origin required by the
North American free trade agreement (Nafta).
The work groups are to let the company operate 'just-in-time' inventory
management with its new Mexico-based suppliers.
VW expects to face tougher competition in Mexico from US imports after Nafta
is implemented, while it intends to expand exports to the US and Central and
South America in the near future.
Cotton textile workers have been on strike since July 9, after employers
declined to offer more than 10 per cent wage rises and tried to eliminate
rigid work demarcations.
