METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PSYCHIATRIC EXAM ORDERED FOR NURSE 
A registered nurse charged with hastening the deaths of two dying patients in 
her care at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills was ordered Tuesday by a 
San Fernando Superior Court judge to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. 
The evaluation's conclusions will be used to help guide the court's sentencing 
if Linda Sue Rangel, 35, of Canyon Country, pleads guilty to two counts of 
attempted murder, said Judge John H. Major. 
Rangel was arrested Nov. 21 in connection with the deaths of Lorraine Sammons, 
50, of Lake View Terrace, and Pedro Contreras, 40, of Sun Valley. Both had shot 
themselves in unrelated suicide attempts, authorities said. 
Rangel allegedly speeded their deaths by lowering the oxygen level on the two 
patients' mechanical ventilators without consulting either the patients' 
families or their physicians. 
Rangel's attorney, Larry Baker, refused to comment. She faces life imprisonment 
if convicted of both charges.
