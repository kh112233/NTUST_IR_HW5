SOME WEALTHY STILL ESCAPE INCOME TAX 
Despite repeated government efforts to close loopholes, some wealthy Americans 
are still able to scrape together enough deductions to avoid paying any U.S. 
income tax, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday. 
Of 557,848 couples and individuals who reported income of $200,000 or more on 
returns filed in 1988, 472 with total income of $211 million paid no income 
tax. Two of them, both unidentified, even reported receiving unemployment 
compensation. 
The most popular deduction was for interest paid, which exceeded income on 29 
of the 472 no-tax returns. Income was exceeded by deductions for theft, fire 
and other casualty losses on 12 returns. 
Of the high-income people who paid taxes, about 9,300 paid less than 5%. 
Another 17,082 reduced their liability to less than 10%, which is about the 
same as paid by the average $35,000-a-year family. 
In its annual report on the tax liabilities of high-income people, the IRS said 
58% of those with income of $200,000 and up reported capital gains -- profits 
from the sale of investments -- that averaged $384,476. By comparison, salaries 
averaged $291,646. 
The study, prepared principally by Allen H. Lerman of the Treasury Department's 
Office of Tax Analysis, is based on raw tax returns. Some of the non-taxpayers 
could be moved onto the tax rolls after IRS audits. 
The report said 3,396 people with high incomes would have avoided federal 
income taxes altogether had it not been for the alternative minimum tax. This 
levy -- a special net designed to ensure that high-income people pay some tax 
regardless of how many legitimate deductions they claim -- cost 35,223 top 
earners a total of $1 billion. 
However, the reach of the minimum tax plunged from the previous year, when the 
levy took $4.8 billion from 158,903 high-income filers. 
One of the provisions Congress wrote into a major deficit-reduction bill last 
week to raise the tax burden on the rich boosts the 21% rate of the minimum tax 
to 24%. 
Through the years, the number of tax-free rich people has been only a tiny 
fraction of the wealthy. The most recent IRS report showed the 557,848 
taxpayers in the $200,000-and-over group paid a total $72.7 billion, an average 
of $130,276 apiece. 
The report said 381 high-income people who paid no tax claimed itemized 
deductions totaling $161.3 million, an average of $423,000.
