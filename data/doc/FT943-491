FT  29 SEP 94 / The European Pensions Ruling: Outcome represents 'a nasty
knock for schemes' - People can be made to work to 65 / FT reporters analyse
yesterday's decisions of the European Court of Justice which are expected to
form a definitive framework under which employers and scheme trustees can
provide equal pensions for men and women
Employers reacted anxiously to yesterday's ruling by the European Court of
Justice that female part-timers could claim pensions retrospectively if they
had been excluded from company schemes.
'The costs are substantial,' said Mr Robbie Gilbert, employment affairs
director of the Confederation of British Industry.
The CBI highlighted a government actuary's report that backdated pension
demands by part-timers could alone cost companies and their pension funds
about Pounds 7bn. Beyond that there is the administrative expense of tracing
employees who might have left a company nearly 20 years ago. 'There is a
practical difficulty of tracking people down,' said Mr Gilbert.
Analysts have stressed that the numbers represent a theoretical maximum. Mr
Paul Moloney, pensions officer of the GMB general union, went further and
yesterday described the Pounds 7bn figure as 'nonsense'. He added: 'If
employers had been prudent over the last few years and set aside some of the
pensions surpluses they reaped then there would not have been any costs.'
Anxiety in business remains nevertheless. Ms Hilary Langley of Watson
consulting actuaries said: 'People are very concerned by the judgment. It
will be a nasty knock for employee pension schemes.'
The strongest reaction to the European Court's move came not from the UK but
from the Netherlands, which has one of the highest rates of part-time
working in Europe.
The Netherlands' VB association of corporate pension funds said the change
could cost Dutch pension funds up to Fl1.2bn (Pounds 436m). At least 100,000
workers, and perhaps as many as 165,000, may have been excluded from their
companies' pension schemes in the Netherlands because they worked part time.
The Federation of Netherlands Industry noted reports that the statute of
limitations of each individual country would apply. In the Netherlands,
employees have five years to claim back pay from an employer. With the
European Court equating pensions with pay, the same five-year limitation
might apply to pension rights, reducing the bill to industry.
Business sectors responded to the resolution of the court cases with varying
degrees of anxiety. 'The burden will not fall evenly,' said Mr Gilbert of
the CBI. 'The main burden will fall on those companies with relatively high
numbers of part-timers.' Retailing and financial services would be hardest
hit.
'It's not very good news,' said Mr Nick Bubb, retail sector analyst at US
investment bank Morgan Stanley. 'If it became law it would have a very
significant impact on food and food retailing.'
Part-time workers make up 40 per cent of staff costs in non-food retailing.
Mr Bubb thought a retailer such as WH Smith, with a large pensions surplus,
could afford to finance back pensions better than some of its competitors.
Kingfisher, the retailing group, said its scheme was open to part-time
employees but only to those working 16 hours or more a week. 'That is not
fixed,' said Mr Peter Styles, group benefits manager. 'We are looking
gradually to ease that.'
Kingfisher has a contributory scheme and therefore could expect that
employees would be cautious about making the retrospective contributions
that would entitle them to retrospective pension payouts.
A manager at one Dutch company in the catering business said: 'It's not good
for business if we're confronted with surprises dating back from the 1970s.
The ruling would effectively be rewriting the pay-and-conditions agreements
we signed 20 years ago.'
Most UK retailers played down the impact the court's verdicts would have, at
least on their pension funds, if not on their competitors. Tesco, the food
retailing chain, said its non-contributory pension scheme had been open to
all part-timers for several years.
Marks and Spencer said the decision would have no impact on its provision of
pensions for part-timers. M&amp;S opened its scheme to part-timers in 1975 while
the court ruling only addresses the period after 1976. 'I could see that for
other companies it might make for financial difficulties,' said Mr John
Peachey, group pensions manager. 'It does not matter for us. We are lucky in
that respect because we grasped the nettle many years ago.'
Vendex, the leading Dutch non-food retailer, said it expected to feel only
limited effects from the ruling, in spite of the large number of part-time
workers in its workforce. Until the Barber case in 1990, part-time employees
who worked less than 840 hours a year were excluded from the company's
pension fund. 'All our part-timers are now in the pension fund and have been
since 1990,' the company said. 'We don't expect any great interest among
people who worked just a few hours a week in the past to pay the premiums
that would allow them to draw a pension.'
Trade unions such as the GMB and MSF welcomed the ruling on part-time
workers. 'We have always said that part-timers have a right to join a
pension scheme and it makes sense that it is backdated,' said Mr Moloney of
the GMB.
But employees' organisations criticised the decision of the European Court
that equalisation of pensions could in some circumstances involve the
worsening of terms for women. 'When people speak of a Pounds 7bn cost to
employers on the issue of part-time workers they fail to realise that
companies are going to save many times that on the second ruling,' said Mr
Moloney.
