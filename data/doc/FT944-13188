FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Medeva wins patent case against Biogen
Medeva, the pharmaceutical company, yesterday scored an important legal
victory against Biogen, its US rival, over the right to develop a hepatitis
B vaccine in Britain.
Its shares climbed 9p to 174p after the Court of Appeal in London overturned
an earlier High Court ruling that Medeva had infringed Biogen's patents.
The move, enabling the company to develop and manufacture the treatment in
the UK - a market worth an estimated Pounds 12m a year - could prompt
challenges against Biogen in other in European countries.
Welcoming the court decision, Mr Bill Bogie, Medeva chief executive, said:
'They not only threw out the previous ruling but decided the Biogen patent
was invalid. That opens a number of commercial and legal opportunities for
us.'
A bid by Medeva to develop and sell its vaccine in markets such as Germany
and France, however, could prove difficult following a European Patent
Office's decision in July to uphold Biogen's hepatitis B patent.
That meant Medeva had to persuade the courts to revoke the patent in each
market where it wanted a presence.
Yesterday's court ruling signalled Medeva's first successful challenge
against Biogen.
'It's very exciting,' said Mr Bogie. 'It allows us to develop the vaccine
here in the UK and export it to markets where Biogen's patent does not
apply, such as the Far East.'
Such opportunities could give Medeva a sizeable share of a market with an
estimated global value of Pounds 500m a year.
Biogen, meanwhile, said it was considering its options and did not rule out
taking the legal action further.
'This is of no material financial impact,' said Ms Amy Hedison, head of
investor relations at Biogen. 'But we will vigorously defend our patent in
any country where Medeva challenges it.'
