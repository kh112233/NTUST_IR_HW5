FT  05 NOV 93 / Brain disorder verdict opens way for compensation
AN INQUEST jury yesterday returned a verdict of 'medical misadventure' on
Patrick Baldwin, a 29-year-old naval engineer who died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease, a brain disorder contracted as a result of taking a contaminated
growth hormone that was administered during childhood.
Lawyers acting for Baldwin's parents said the verdict at Lincoln Coroner's
Court opened the way for families who had suffered from contaminated
hormones to take legal action against the government for compensation. Mr
David Body, the Baldwins' solicitor, said writs would be issued in the High
Court next week.
Baldwin was one of 1,900 children in Britain who received growth hormone to
treat short stature between 1958 and 1985. An unknown quantity of the
hormone - extracted from the pituitary glands of corpses - was contaminated
with the disease, a human version of BSE or 'mad cow' disease. In addition,
an estimated 300 women who received infertility treatment with hormone
extracted from corpses may be at risk.
Although 10 people in the UK have died of the disease after growth hormone
treatment, Mr Baldwin was the first to receive an inquest.
After the verdict Dr Nigel Chapman, the coroner, said: 'It would be
advisable for the 1,900 people who were given the human growth hormone to be
monitored very carefully. It is not clear how many, if any, will be affected
by CJD but the implications of this case are far-reaching.'
Last month Australian researchers estimated that 30,000 people worldwide
were treated with potentially contaminated hormones before 1985, when three
young people died of the disease and the procedure was stopped.
The UK government has denied liability and refused requests for
compensation. But the Labour party last night supported Mr Body's call for a
change of policy. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'It is
essential that a comprehensive screening and support service is
established.'
