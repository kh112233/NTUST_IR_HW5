C. National Environmental Policy Act 


A finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).
The finding of no significant impact is available for public inspection and copying Monday through Friday during
regular business hours at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, room 10276, Department
of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. 


D. Executive Order 12612, Federalism 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review under the order. The notice
announces incentive funds to encourage neighborhood organizations to become more self-sufficient in their development
activities. 


E. Executive Order 12606, the Family 


The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
notice has potential for a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. The purpose
of the notice is to provide funding to improve neighborhood opportunities relating to employment, business, housing,
and the provision of essential services, all of which could benefit families significantly. However, because the
impact on families would be indirect and would be beneficial, no further review is considered necessary. 


F. Section 102 HUD Reform Act: Documentation and Public Access Requirements 


HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 

Federal Register

 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 


G. Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act 


HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42
U.S.C. 3537a) was published on May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified
as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply
until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. 

HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 

Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 7083815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed
with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Area or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters counsel
for the program to which the question pertains. 


H. Section 112 of the Reform Act 


Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 
Section 13 has been implemented by 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department
in these ways, they are urged to read part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of that part. 
Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 204103000. Telephone: (202) 7083815 (voice/TDD)
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.
