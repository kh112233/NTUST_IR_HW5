FT  16 FEB 94 / UK group may equip jets for Argentina
Smiths Industries of the UK is competing for a contract to provide avionics
systems for 36 Skyhawk fighter bombers that Argentina is to buy from the US.
Smiths said yesterday it 'has offered to supply' avionics updates for the
aircraft and was discussing sale terms.
The sale of both the aircraft and the avionics was strongly opposed by the
British government, which claimed they would threaten the security of the
Falkland Islands.
A Smiths Industries official said yesterday: 'You can be assured that this
company would not proceed without keeping the appropriate authorities fully
informed.' He said that although Smiths had not made a formal request for UK
government clearance, it maintained informal contacts with the government on
the subject.
It first emerged in October that a wholly owned US subsidiary of Smiths
Industries had begun talks with Argentina's air force to sell an avionics
package. McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed, both of the US, also entered
discussions on the deal.
The Argentine Defence Ministry is understood to have preferred the Smiths
approach, hoping this would underline the 'anachronistic' nature of the
British arms embargo, still in place since the 1982 Falklands conflict.
On February 1, Washington said it would sell the aircraft to replace some of
the 60 Argentina lost in the conflict. But it agreed to UK requests that the
1970s vintage Skyhawks would not be equipped with state of the art avionics.
