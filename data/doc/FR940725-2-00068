<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of a partially exclusive license, limited
by field of use, to practice the inventions embodied in patents listed below of this notice to Comedicus, Inc., having
a place of business in Long Lake, MN. The patent rights in these inventions have been assigned to the Government of the
United States of America. The patents and patent applications to be licensed are:

The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within 60 days from the date of this published
Notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the licenses would not be consistent
with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
Nitric Oxide (NO) has been implicated as an important bioregulatory mediator in a variety of processes including
the normal physiological control of blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation/adhesion, bronchodilation,
neurotransmission, immunologically induced cytostasis and penile erection. National Cancer Institute scientists
have discovered that compounds of the structure X-[N(O)NO]-, which will be designated as ``NONOates'', have the
ability to sustain the release of nitric oxide into a biological medium. Various compounds of this family have been
synthesized and shown to have different kinetics of NO release. Several of these compounds have been tested 

in vitro

 and 

in vivo

 in model systems and have shown potent biological effects. 
Requests for a copy of these patent applications, inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated
license should be directed to: Ms. Carol Lavrich, Office of Technology Transfer, National Institutes of Health,
6011 Executive Blvd., Rockville, MD 20892. Telephone: (301) 4967735, ext. 287; Facsimile: (301) 4020220.
A signed confidentiality agreement will be required to receive copies of patent applications. Properly filed competing
applications for a license filed in response to this notice will be treated as objections to the contemplated license.
Only written comments and/or applications for a competing license which are received by the NIH Office of Technology
Transfer within sixty (60) days of this notice will be considered.
