SHORT TAKES; 
MUNCH 'MADONNA' PRINT STOLEN 
A rare lithographic print of Norwegian painter Edvard Munch's "Madonna" was 
stolen from an art gallery in central Oslo early today, police said. 
Munch's "Madonna," one of the most famous lithographic works, and three 
lesser-known works of art were removed by the thieves, who used an iron rail to 
batter down the entrance to the gallery. 
According to one of the gallery owners, the theft of the "Madonna" was likely 
to have been what he called a "contract job" for a collector. Kjell Wenstad of 
the Kunsthuset gallery said the print, estimated to be worth about $245,000, 
was very rare and would be extremely difficult to sell.
