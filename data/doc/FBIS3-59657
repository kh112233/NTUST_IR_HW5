<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The MLU002 test vehicle for the Miyazaki test track was 
destroyed in a fire on 3 October 1991. 
  Although later running tests proceeded based on the 
conditions defined for the MLU001 manufactured in 1980, in order 
to develop vehicles for use on the Yamanashi test track, new 
test vehicles were needed to perform various tests and 
verification. Therefore, construction began on a new MLU002N 
test vehicle. This vehicle was completed at the end of last year 
and has been available for running tests since the end of 
January. 
<H5>  Basic Specifications of the MLU002N </H5>
  The following two proposals were considered as the design 
objective for the new test vehicle. 
  (1) With the premise of restoring the burned MLU002 to its 
original state, the only major revisions in the specifications 
are measures for fire. 
  (2) The design is completely redone. When possible, 
pre-checking of the vehicle for the Yamanashi test track is 
included in the specification revision. 
  Although proposal (2) was desired, the design and 
manufacturing periods were extremely short and an early start of 
full-scale testing at the Miyazaki test track was important. As 
a result, we proceeded with the design based on proposal (1) 
where restoration to the original state was critical. 
  From the manufacturing period in 1987 to the time of the 
fire, improvements lead to significant changes in the structure 
of the car and the superconducting magnets. The table compares 
the specifications of MLU002N's main features.

<H5>  Fastest Target Speed </H5>
  As with the MLU002, the fastest target speed in the design 
goal was the 420 km/h. 
  To achieve this speed on the 7 km long Miyazaki test track 
requires a highly reliable drive system of power supply 
equipment, surface coils, and superconducting magnets. Even the 
car fulfills the necessary conditions of a reliable independent 
braking system in the car and a lighter weight. 
  The weight of the car was increased by the fire measures to 
a 
final weight of 20 tons. It was clearly shown that removing some 
of the equipment and parts during the high-speed running test 
lessened the weight. Air brakes, that are not affected by the 
quench of the superconducting magnets or problems in the power 
supply system, were formally adopted as the independent brakes 
used on the car for emergency operation. (By having the brake 
discs project from the car body, air drag is increased to obtain 
braking power.) However, when simpler and lighter constructions 
are considered, the design was limited to the direction used. 
  As a result, even in the extreme condition of no 
regenerative 
braking, quench from half of the superconducting magnets, and 
one non-working air brake, the run curve for the high-speed runs 
on the test track is provided with a coil short-circuit 
generated braking interval at the terminal stop. Calculations 
showed that stopping from 420 km/h will be possible. 
<H5>  The Chassis and the Car </H5>
  Based on the investigation into the cause of the car fire on 
the MLU002, a variety of measures were implemented for fire 
resistance and noncombustibility. 
  The current cross-sectional shape of the chassis and the 
front shape are identical to those of the MLU002. However, the 
front of the structure was changed to an aluminum alloy made 
from carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) and the front window 
was eliminated. 
  The materials used inside the car were noncombustible or 
fire 
resistant. Passenger facilities like interior furnishings, 
lighting, and air conditioning were the minimum required for the 
tests. The car's interior was partitioned into three sections. 
Only the central section, which is the instrument room, is 
surrounded by magnetic shielding plates. Seating space for 12 
people is maintained, but tests are being performed without any 
seats installed. 
  The car has different structures for the Miyazaki A Car and 
the Hyuga B Car. Car B has the same basic design of the car at 
the time of the fire and uses a linking superconducting magnetic 
elastic suspension method. Car A uses the newly designed 
superconducting magnetic elastic suspension method for the 
two-car frame. Since both cars operate under the conditions of 
opposing levitation sections mixed with sidewall levitation 
sections in the Miyazaki test track, restrictions are placed on 
the car and the construction and elastic suspension cannot 
normally be used. Consequently, the elastic suspension mechanism 
for the superconducting magnet is usually suppressed and tests 
are performed in a constant state. Elastic suspension is only 
activated to test the elastic suspension method. 
  The extension amount of the support leg and accompanying car 
height were corrected to the standard design values in the 
conventional opposing levitation method. 
  The superconducting magnets that have the same 
specifications 
as those in the revised MLU002 model were designed to have low 
current densities. The air-conditioning system installed in Car 
A uses the Claude process and that in Car B uses the Sterling 
process. Since the battery has capacity to operate only one car 
from the power source in the car operating the car's air 
conditioner. A lighter weight is designed by operating only one 
side during the running tests. 
  The above diagram [not included] shows the exterior of the 
car. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  Immediately before Japan National Railways was broken up and 
privatized, the MLU002, that had been nurtured under the 
guidance of the Railway Technical Research Institute, was weak 
by nature. Nevertheless, we persevered. As a result, 
expectations are increasing, but difficult problems concerning 
the real ability are troublesome. At last, we are quickly 
approaching the final phase. 
  Given the priceless instruction received from the MLU002, 
the 
initial design that was the responsibility of the Railway 
Technical Research Institute, and the intense scrutiny, the 
MLU002N was born. Although I believe a variety of problems will 
be encountered in the future, I would like to see them dealt 
with seriously.
