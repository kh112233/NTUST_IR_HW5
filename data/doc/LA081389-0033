DOLPHIN SLAUGHTER 
Once again, The Times serves as the apologist for the destruction caused by the 
commercial tuna fishing fleet. Sunday's Cousteau Watch column (Aug. 6) refers 
to tuna fleets that "kill ocean-going dolphins by inadvertently catching them 
in purse-seine nets." This could not be farther from the truth. 
The international tuna industry deliberately sets these highly destructive nets 
on schools of dolphin to trap the tuna swimming below. There have been 
documented cases in which thousands of these gentle and graceful creatures have 
been killed to net a handful of yellowfin. 
The Marine Mammal Protection Act has gone virtually unenforced through both 
Democratic and Republican administrations. Observers on U.S. ships are 
regularly harassed, and there are no provisions to observe foreign flag vessels 
which comprise the bulk of the fleet. Dolphins, in the meantime, are being 
eradicated in certain coastal waters. 
Your article quotes nearly 2 million killed in our own coastal Pacific waters 
since the act passed in 1972. These "official" figures are provided by none 
other than the tuna industry. They do not take into account under-reporting (by 
some estimates by as much as 100%) and the untold millions of mangled and 
near-drowned victims released to a certain death. The disruption of these 
intelligent creatures' social order once set upon by the tuna nets compounds 
the disaster by allowing ever-present predators to finish the destruction. 
The fishing industry remains the last great industrial hunter of wild animals 
in their natural habitat. One by one, industrial hunting has endangered or 
destroyed important species: whales, seals and sea lions, elephants, buffalo, 
alligators, wild dogs, and on and on. The MMLA has good intentions but does not 
go far enough to protect the remaining cetacean wildlife from destruction, 
especially when enforcement is non-existent.
