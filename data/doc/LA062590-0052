SURVIVORS GATHER REMNANTS OF THEIR PAST; 
IRAN: FAMILIES SHED THE SHOCK AND GRIEF OF THE DISASTER AND BEGIN TO THINK 
ABOUT THE FUTURE. 
An old wire tray, a broken chandelier and some twisted blue window blinds. 
That's not much for a new start. But atop a heap of bricks and plaster that was 
a home, those objects had been set aside by a surviving family of Iran's killer 
earthquake. 
In the shattered city of Manjil in hard-hit Gilan province, families were 
shedding the shock and grief of the past three days and beginning Sunday to 
think about their future. The dead have been buried in a low hillside outside 
the city and the seriously injured taken to hospitals in Tehran. 
Scoops, shovels and men with picks and spades were sifting through the rubble 
for personal belongings -- furniture, carpets, kitchenware -- no longer with 
the care that followed Thursday's massive earthquake when the people of Manjil 
were searching for survivors. They now know their family losses in dead and 
injured. 
Talking to visiting reporters half an hour after another aftershock rocked the 
agricultural city overlooking Safid Reservoir, the townspeople showed little 
apprehension; there was work to be done. A pile of new yellow bricks sat by a 
curb, ready for rebuilding when the site is cleared. 
Iraj Behnia, a 57-year-old teacher, said his was one of the few families in 
Manjil to escape death. "But I can't feel happy," said the stocky Iranian in a 
black felt cap. "All the other families have suffered. Their problem is my 
problem." 
Others felt the same. Dr. Mohammed Hussein Dehjhany bused up to Manjil from the 
central city of Esfahan with his students, 13 male nurses, all, like the 
doctor, in white medical coats, to help out. "We are doing what we can, 
whatever the people want," he explained. 
Earthquakes are fickle. Three houses in a row will be squashed like old tin 
cans and the fourth will be standing. But Thursday's quake stomped Manjil. An 
estimated 80% to 90% of the homes were destroyed. The death toll among the 
100,000 citizens was uncertain, but one relief worker estimated that more than 
60% of the populace was killed or injured. 
But the quake didn't crush the people's spirit. The work went on Sunday with 
neighbors helping neighbors, along with shovel-bearing detachments of uniformed 
soldiers. At other sites, some men worked alone, pulling back the sheets of 
tar-paper roofs to see what might be found underneath. 
Alijan Mustfada, a shopkeeper who helped other men dig through the rubble of 
his home, said he would live nowhere else. "Our memories are here," he said. 
Mustfada lost two sons in the quake. 
An old woman in a light-blue chador was making tea for her remaining family in 
a military tent on the side of the road when reporters approached. She spoke a 
few words of English, enough to get her point across without an interpreter. 
There were 16 deaths in her extended family, five in the badly damaged city of 
Roudbar nearby and the rest in Manjil. 
"I worry (about it)," she explained, "but I'm not upset. It happened. It 
happened." Her house was demolished, her car -- "German," she lamented -- was 
crushed, and she's living in the street. But life goes on. 
Other women were not so stoic, telling reporters in the Farsi language, which 
the Westerners could not understand, and in mime, which they did, what happened 
on Thursday. They threw arms up for the explosion of the quake and down for the 
fate of their city. 
It's hard to deal with the immensity of the casualties in a disaster of this 
dimension, perhaps 50,000 dead and hundreds of thousands injured in Gilan and 
Zanjan provinces in the hilly country west of the Caspian Sea. 
Flying over the region in an Iranian air force Chinook helicopter, reporters 
saw the scars in village after village. A huddle of 30 or 40 mud-brick homes 
had a hole punched in the middle, but the houses on the perimeter appeared 
untouched. The city of Roudbar looked as if it had been shelled into rubble. 
Fifty thousand lives lost in two provinces having nearly 3 million population 
is believable, but the towns and cities are scattered, and the countryside 
seems tranquil until you see the wrecked structures. 
At a stop in the village of Tarem, there was nothing to see but shambles. The 
people are Kurds, who were moved from their homes in the northeastern corner of 
Iran 16 years ago by the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to suppress trouble 
between the Kurds and his government. 
On Sunday, the colorfully dressed women were chanting in grief for their dead. 
They sat on a ridge at the edge of the village, which looked like an upturned 
box of matches. Tarem lies beside a river, and the houses were made in part of 
timber and reeds. The children flocked barefoot to see the helicopter set down 
in a field of thorn bushes. 
Children, however frightened they were by the quake and the aftershocks, 
provide the laughter in the stricken region. 
In Manjil, a small boy, his head helmeted in bandages, popped out of the 
family's tent and snapped a sharp salute to the touring foreign press, a little 
soldier in a scene of tragedy.
