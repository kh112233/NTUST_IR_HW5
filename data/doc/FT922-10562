FT  30 APR 92 / Chinese struck by an epidemic of fake cures
A DISINFECTANT spray allegedly able to kill the Aids virus in 30 seconds is
one of many fake medicines on the Chinese market making extravagant and
false claims for their curative powers.
Composed of medicinal plants and herbs, 'Shenglu' can be rubbed or sprayed
on, injected or gargled, says the advertising literature. It is one of a
number of 'anti-Aids' products, claiming to kill or prevent the spread of
the deadly virus, which are available over the counter in Beijing department
stores.
Chen Minzhang, health minister, called this week for a crackdown on illegal
profiteering from imitating well-regarded traditional Chinese medicines. But
despite the misleading claims made for the restorative herbal powers of
anti-Aids products in particular, health authorities seem powerless to act
or to help people distinguish genuine from false medicine.
The medical claims for some products are merely odd. SOD is an
'anti-senility' toothpaste, developed and manufactured by the Shanghai
Toothpaste Factory which produces 600m tubes a year.
SOD (superoxide dismutase) toothpastes are believed to be able to resist
senility in the human body, the Xinhua news agency reported with only a hint
of scepticism.
Another Xinhua report from Taiyuan claimed a newly-developed traditional
Chinese medical concoction could cure mental retardation. The product,
Xingnaokang, is reported to have had a 95 per cent success rate in raising
IQs without side effects.
Aids products are in a different category, as unscrupulous manufacturers
play on people's fears of a terminal and terrible disease to make money,
with widespread ignorance about Aids encouraging exploitation.
