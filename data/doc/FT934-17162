FT  02 OCT 93 / Ford recalls 57,000 Mondeos
FORD is recalling 57,000 Mondeo family saloon cars in the UK because of a
minor defect to the handbrake lever. The recalled cars were made between
March and June this year at Ford's Belgian factory in Genk. The defect is
only in right-hand-drive vehicles.
The handbrake design has been adjusted and Ford said that dealers would fit
a new handgrip to the brake lever of affected cars.
