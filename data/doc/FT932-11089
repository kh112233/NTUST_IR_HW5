FT  06 MAY 93 / World Bank's loan check plan rejected
WORLD BANK shareholder countries have sent management back to the drawing
board to produce a new set of measures for improving the implementation and
supervision of loans.
Executive directors representing the member countries rejected a first-draft
action plan called 'Next Steps' as an inadequate response to a commission's
report which documented an alarming deterioration in the performance of the
World Bank's loan port-folio. The commission was chaired by Mr Willi
Wapenhans.
The report said that more than 75 per cent of World Bank projects showed
acceptable performance, but noted a steady deterioration in portfolio
performance.
The proportion of projects with significant problems rose from 11 per cent
in 1981 to 20 per cent in 1991.
The World Bank has been caught in the unfavourable spotlight cast in recent
weeks on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, its sister
multilateral bank.
Some members of Congress are treating the Clinton administration's request
for funds for the International Development Association, the concessional
loan arm of the World Bank, with as little enthusiasm as they are showing
for EBRD funding.
But the administration, although at first hesitant about the size of the IDA
contribution negotiated by its predecessor, is throwing its weight behind
the request, involving a Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 796m) US contribution this
year.
