FT  13 OCT 92 / Five injured in IRA London pub bombing
FIVE people were injured, one seriously, when an IRA bomb exploded in the
heart of London's West End yesterday.
The bomb exploded at lunchtime in a pub in the Covent Garden area. It was
the eighth to explode in the capital over the past week.
It followed a warning nine minutes before the blast to a radio station that
police described as 'deliberately vague and confusing'. The warning used a
recognised IRA codeword and said the bomb had been placed in the 'Leicester
Square area', leaving officers with little time to clear surrounding
buildings.
Although the recent attacks have involved relatively small devices and
caused few casualties, they have been marked by a constant shift in tactics
aimed at stretching police resources while giving maximum publicity to the
IRA.
The bombing campaign coincides with cross-party talks on Northern Ireland's
future involving nationalist and Unionist leaders, but excluding Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the IRA.
Yesterday's bomb was a grim reminder of the pub bombings of the 1970s in
Guildford and Birmingham.
On Saturday a bomb exploded in a telephone box near the high-security
Paddington Green police station, west London, where IRA terrorist suspects
are held. It was followed by an IRA statement warning: 'British military and
political leaders should take this signal of our intentions seriously.' Last
week there were also car-bomb explosions, other minor devices, and a series
of hoaxes.
An RUC officer was slightly injured late last night when a bomb was thrown
at a security patrol in north Belfast.
