FT  05 MAY 94 / Arts: Burrows back in form - Dance
For admirers of Jonathan Burrows the question has been what he would do
next. Of his talent there has never been doubt. From his apprentice
creations, then in pieces made for the Royal Ballet's touring company, then
in independent stagings, Burrows' choreographic style moved from
folk-influenced energy to something magnificently awkward, uncompromising.
His most assured works - Hymns, Stoics, rainy morning spoke of a creator
fascinated by mute suffering. The controlled ferocity of their language,
with harsh stampings and contortions of the body, was also compassionate.
Burrows saw lives that were a stifled cry of pain, and his movement, wild,
autistic, sometimes very funny, provided an exact parallel without
descending into mimicry.
His last piece, Very, made over a year ago, I found too cussed, too
uncommunicative. He had painted himself into a creative corner, and the
question about Our was whether he had escaped from these difficult confines.
I saw Our on Tuesday night at The Place, and record with pleasure that
Burrows has freed himself. Movement is fluid, structure more relaxed in
outline and broader in dynamic range.
The theme is Burrows' continuing fascination with the human condition. But
it would be as useful as trying to describe the actions of a crowd, as to
give coherent account of what I saw. Burrows quotes Baudelaire as an
epigraph: 'To express at once the attitude and the gesture of living beings,
whether solemn or grotesque, and their luminous explosion in space'.
This is what Burrows does after his own fashion: the anonymous arena of The
Place, grey with a white back-drop. Four women (Lynne Bristow and Deborah
Jones - Burrows' fine Royal Ballet colleagues; Susana Garcia, Fionuala
Power) and two men (Edwin Lung, Henry Montes). Ravishing clothes from Issey
Miyake (grey trousers, jackets, vests; exquisite cut; subtle pleating: new
dance has never been better dressed). Fine lighting from Tina McHugh. Faint,
evocative burblings and tickings as accompaniment from Matteo Fargion.
The dance curves and surges through the bodies, pivots at arm or shoulder,
drives onward in kicks, draws the cast together or separates them. We see
encounters that hint at loving, hating, battling, consoling. There are
mysterious journeys, recapitulations - people live trapped in emotional
tape-loops - and ventures into darkness, quests for light. Burrows' dance is
both camera and x-ray, recording and revealing: how couples love, how they
depend upon each other and battle with each other; what age can do to body
and to companionship. All this we can sense through the movement. Burrows'
dance is pure yet eloquent: there can be no greater accolade.
The piece lasts just under an hour (hence Our). It is admirably crafted,
tremendously danced. Lynne Bristow was notably fine as a classical dancer at
Covent Garden. She is shown here as a superlative exponent - none better -
of the new dance: speed, clarity, amazing rhythmic virtuosity, all are hers.
The other members of the cast are no less convincing, and fascinating as
personalities. How well we seem to know them as the piece ends.
The Place until May 7, then to the Roedean Theatre as part of the Brighton
Festival on May 14, 15.
