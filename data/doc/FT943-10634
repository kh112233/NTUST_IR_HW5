FT  04 AUG 94 / Israeli MPs pass Jordanian accord
Israel's parliament overwhelmingly endorsed last week's peace accord with
Jordan in a rare display of political consensus between left and right on
the Middle East peace process.
Hours after parliament voted 91-3 in favour of the Israeli-Jordanian
declaration three Israeli fighter jets escorted King Hussein's low-flying
aircraft on an unprecedented flight through the Jewish state's airspace.
In an effort to gain maximum support for the declaration Mr Rabin assured
parliament Israel would maintain its sovereignty over Jerusalem, despite
recognising King Hussein special role over the holy city's Islamic sites.
Opposition right-wing parties, which fiercely oppose the peace accord with
Palestinians and any withdrawal from the Golan Heights in peace talks with
Syria, supported the Jordanian agreement.
'We are in a rare moment in the people's unity in which the opposition is
also in support of the government's political moves,' Mr Benjamin Netanyahu,
leader of the right-wing Likud party said.
King Hussein's flight yesterday was the first official passage of a
Jordanian aircraft through Israeli airspace since the creation of the Jewish
state in 1948. It was timed to mark parliament's endorsement of the accord
and to symbolise the new era of normal relations developing rapidly between
the two countries.
Next Monday King Hussein and Mr Rabin will meet on their Red Sea border to
open a new crossing. Throughout yesterday's parliamentary debate Israeli and
Jordanian tractor crews tore down razor wire fences to build the new border
post 3.5km north of Eilat.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state who is visiting the region,
will attend the border dedication ceremony and make the first telephone call
between the two states. Israel's communications ministry also said yesterday
a fibre optic cable will be eventually laid from Amman across the Jordan
river into Israel.
