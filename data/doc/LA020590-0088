ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; 
17-YEAR-OLD INJURED AS CAR, TRUCK COLLIDE 
A 17-year-old Westminster youth suffered serious injuries Sunday in a 
two-vehicle crash that left him trapped in the wreckage, police said. 
Derrek Alexander Enz was in serious condition at Long Beach Memorial Hospital 
with head injuries and multiple breaks in both legs. 
Enz was a passenger in a Ford Mustang that collided with a Nissan pickup truck 
at Bolsa Chica Road and Westminster Boulevard about 7:55 a.m. 
Paramedics had to use a hydraulic prying device to free Enz from the car. 
Because rain prevented an airlift rescue, he was taken by ambulance to the 
hospital, police said. 
The vehicles' drivers sustained only minor injuries, police said. Each claimed 
to have a green light at the intersection, and police were seeking witnesses to 
resolve the conflicting statements. It was raining at the time of the 
collision, but police did not know if that was a factor.
