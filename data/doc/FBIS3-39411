  [Text] Ankara--Widening trade deficits and plunging foreign 
aid put Turkey's current account deficit in the first 11 months 
of 1993 at an all-time high of $5.54 billion, a staggering 
increase of 896.5 percent from a deficit of $556 million during 
the same period of 1992. 
  The Turkish Central Bank (CB) said Thursday [17 February] 
that the economy produced a current account deficit of $717 
million in November 1993 compared with the minor deficit of $51 
million in November 1992. Turkey's balance of payments situation 
has radically worsened since early 1993 when the export market 
gave initial signals of a recession. The trade gap for the 
January-November period of 1993 was $12.86 billion, 80 percent 
higher than the deficit of $6.14 billion during the same period 
a year ago. 
  Turkey's foreign debt repayments in the first 10 months of 
last year reached $7.2 billion, of which $4.61 billion was 
principal and $3.1 billion were interest payments. Turkey had 
made foreign debt repayments of $7.2 billion in the 
corresponding period of 1992. 
  The foreign investment flow into the country during the 
January-November period declined from $703 million in 1992 to 
$529 million last year, representing a decrease of 24.5 percent. 
In the same period, Turkish tourism revenues rose by 7.7 
percent to $3.8 billion compared to 1992, while workers' 
remittances declined to $2.68 billion from $2.7 billion a year 
ago.
