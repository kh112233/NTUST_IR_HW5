  [Excerpt] Amman--Jordan on Wednesday [20 April] welcomed 
the willingness of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, to 
accept United Nations resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for 
peace with Israel. 
  "We acknowledge parties who adhere to the relevant United 
Nations resolution and consider this helpful to the peace 
process," information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told the JORDAN 
TIMES. 
  He said that Jordan has accepted United Nations resolutions 
242 and 338 pertaining to the conflict between Israel and each 
of Jordan, Palestine and Syria and resolutions 425 and 426 
pertaining to Lebanon as the basis for peace. 
  He said that when "more parties" accept the Arab consensus 
that acknowledges these resolutions as the basis for Middle East 
peace, "then this would be helpful to the peace process." 
  A leader of the Islamic group Hamas offered to extend 
recognition and make peace with Israel if the latter agrees to 
full withdrawal from the territories it occupied in 1967 
including east Jerusalem. 
  "What is required is the withdrawal of the Zionist forces 
from the West Bank, Gaza and Jerusalem, and dismantling (Jewish) 
settlements," Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the Hamas politburo, who 
is based in Damascus told the Islamist weekly al-Sabil in an 
interview published Tuesday. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. al-'Anani was careful not to mention the movement by 
name 
or indicate a Jordanian recognition of the Islamic group as part 
of the Palestinian leadership. 
  His Majesty King Husayn had said this week that Jordan only 
recognises the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the 
people of Palestine and that "the Palestinians can discuss their 
affairs on their own, they can agree or disagree... this does 
not concern us." [passage omitted]
