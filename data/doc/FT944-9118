FT  17 NOV 94 / US fears for Aegean clash
A US warship was yesterday monitoring separate naval exercises in the Aegean
organised by Greece and Turkey, in a show of Washington's concern over a
possible clash between the two Nato allies. From yesterday, when the new UN
law of the sea came into force, Greece maintains it acquired the right to
extend its territorial waters from six to 12 miles. It says it has no
immediate plans to exercise this option. Turkey, which has repeatedly warned
that any such move would trigger a war, is holding manoeuvres this week in
international waters near the Greek island of Lesbos. About 100 miles to the
south the Greek navy is in charge of an exercise held every year, involving
ships and aircraft from other Nato countries.
