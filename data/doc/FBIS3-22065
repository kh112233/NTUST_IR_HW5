  [Text] The Interior Ministry's Antinarcotics Department 
yesterday launched a large-scale campaign in the valleys of 
south Sinai. Some 42 poppy farms, 50 kg of bango [Egyptian 
slang for hashish], and 15 kg of dry poppy seeds were discovered 
and seized in the north of the Saint Catherine district. 
  In a campaign involving the Public, Central Security, and 
Armed Forces, 27 cannabis and poppy farms were discovered in the 
south of Saint Catherine. For the first time, the troops 
involved in the campaigns sprayed the illegal poppy and cannabis 
farms from the air. Large narcotic plantations throughout the 
area were sprayed. Some 106 poppy plantations were found in the 
two raids. 
  The troops are continuing their clampdown on drug farms in 
the region.
