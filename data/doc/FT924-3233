FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MP presses on Iraq arms issue
THE prime minister refused to be drawn yesterday on claims by Mr Ken
Livingstone, the leftwing Labour MP, that Mr Jonathan Moyle, a British
journalist, was murdered while investigating alleged links between Mr Mark
Thatcher, son of the former prime minister, and the arms-to-Iraq affair.
Asked during question time for a response to charges that the Chilean judge
investigating the 'murder' was 'obstructed by the unwillingness of British
officials to co-operate,' Mr Major said such allegations should be referred
to 'the proper authorities'.
Mr Livingstone asked: 'Do you think there is any link with the fact that
Jonathan Moyle was investigating the arms trade of Carlos Cardoen, who was
the main arms procurer for Iraq, was responsible for the transmission of
Matrix Churchill equipment to Iraq and was also the business associate of
Mark Thatcher?'
