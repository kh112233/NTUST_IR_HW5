  The two countries declare in the pact that their relations 
are based on international legal norms and the principles of 
sovereignty and territorial integrity, equal rights, 
noninterference in one another's internal affairs, 
good-neighborliness, mutual trust, and advantageous cooperation. 
  The parties keep in mind that the security of Estonia and 
Hungary is inseparably linked with the security of all states 
participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe process. 
  Both states are prepared to engage in effective cooperation 
in international organizations and they attach great importance 
to developing collaboration between their legislative and 
executive bodies, the local government level included. The 
foreign ministers of the two countries must meet at least once a 
year to discuss, among other issues, the implementation of the 
effective pact. 
  The parties to the agreement pledge to coordinate their 
efforts in mutually advantageous economic cooperation and to 
promote business contacts and direct links. The agreement 
provides for all- round cooperation in transport, easing of 
passenger and goods transport regulations and passport and 
customs checking procedures, and development of tourism. 
  Close cooperation is foreseen in improving data processing 
and communications systems, in science, technology and 
environment protection, and all spheres of culture. Under the 
agreement, Estonia and Hungary will take steps to protect ethnic 
minorities. They also state their readiness for concerted action 
against organized crime, terrorism and drug traffic.
