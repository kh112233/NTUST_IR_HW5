MEASURE A NOT GROWTH MANAGEMENT 
The Measure A sales tax for road widening and road extensions merely solidifies 
the legacy that "traffic congestion will expand to fill available space." 
Measure A is not growth management. 
It is an open-ended, road widening/road extension "wish list" fund; it does not 
mandate specific improvements. It also lacks creative, long-range, 
environmentally sound solutions in addressing the transportation of goods and 
services. 
Were Ventura County residents caught in a shell game when they voted June 5 for 
Proposition 111, which will increase the gasoline tax by 9 cents a gallon? 
Isn't it interesting that the same road-building proponents of Proposition 111 
didn't tell the citizens that Measure A's additional tax for roads was being 
planned for submittal to the voter. In less than 30 days after voter approval 
of Proposition 111, this additional tax measure was approved for placement on 
the ballot. 
Frankly, there are more pressing needs than having my tax dollars used to grid 
Ventura County with roadway cement.
