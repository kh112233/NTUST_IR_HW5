FT  05 MAY 93 / Observer: Female appeal
The resignation of Bjorn Engholm, debonair, pipe-smoking leader of Germany's
Social Democrats, may be a source of regret for women voters, with whom he
was always a big hit. Yet it could be a blessing in disguise for the women's
lobby.
In Schleswig-Holstein, where Engholm was premier, the way is cleared for his
deputy, Heide Simonis, to take over. Currently a no-nonsense finance
minister, she has been much in the public eye as a tough negotiator in the
annual public sector pay round. If elected in this month's polls, she would
become the first woman leader at state level.
But she may not be the only female politician on the up. One name being
mooted as a possible successor to Engholm as SPD leader is that of Renate
Schmidt, the extrovert Bavarian party boss and deputy speaker in the Bonn
parliament. She must be considered an outsider for the job - she claimed
yesterday that she was 'very probably' not in the running - but she would
certainly inject a welcome breath of fresh air into next year's federal
election.
A 49-year-old grandmother from Nuremberg who sports a shock of white curls,
she is a fiery speaker imbued with a touch of south German passion and an
ability to challenge supporters of the male-dominated establishment.
