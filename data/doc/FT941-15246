THE ENGINEER IN THE GARDEN

As Bernard Shaw said to Ellen Terry: 'Yes, but what if our children had my
looks and your brains?' Genetic engineering promises to help them out. It
can also change the plants and animals we share the earth with.
What is genetic engineering? It sounds easy: a strip of material carrying
genetic information is snipped from one organism and patched into another.
The cells' enzymes tidy up. What genetic engineering offers is a cross
between the specific genes of any life form with any other life form. For
humans, all we have to do is sort out the 100,000 genes divided or scattered
into 3 billion base pairs. Each one does something different.
Colin Tudge has written a frustrating book, The Engineer in The Garden which
charts the history and state of genetic engineering. Equipped with a
glossary of genetic terms and a few 'idiot' guides, a reader would have some
chance. But Tudge makes it hard going. The information is embedded, like
small fossils, in the bedrock of the prose. There is no list of further
reading, no page of notes, and no chronological table of genetic science.
These serious doubts aside, this can be a rewarding book. Tudge starts with
Darwin on natural selection (1859) and arrives at Crick and Watson on 'The
molecular structure of nucleic acids: a structure for deoxyribose nucleic
acid (DNA)' in 1953. Then come the molecular biologists and Michael
Crichton's DNA chains on screen at Jurassic Park. En route, Tudge treats no
question as trivial and delivers masses of information. But the result
confused.
While we learn about bees, gannets, deer, peacocks and crocodile eggs, Tudge
moves between scientific practice and its history. He covers the moral
issues which surround DNA fingerprinting and genetic enhancement. He invokes
the twin imperatives of hubris and blasphemy which seem to be the only
concepts developed enough to counter an unchecked drive into a geneticised
future. One piece of good news: since DNA in men and women behaves
differently, neither gender is superfluous. Neither is sex, or at least
there is now an alluring scent called 'DNA' . . . in a double-helix shaped
bottle.
Tudge steers clear of the commercial concerns which drive the research. But
gene technology with bioengineering have a future as limitless as life
itself. Last month's Regulation of the United Kingdom Biotechnology Industry
and Global Competitiveness* suggested that food containing genetically
engineered organisms need not be labelled for consumers; it also pointed out
that 'excessively precautionary' and 'unscientific' regulations might be
handicapping the UK biotechnology industry alongside less stringent controls
in the US and Japan.
But how is the human species doing, genetically? Tudge has a good chapter on
human improvability. Darwin knew rightly that each species has 'descent with
modification.' We are bigger, taller, healthier than we used to be, but why
are not we all Bach or Einstein or Freud? Is there a gene which causes
absent-mindedness in the same sense as there is a gene which causes blue
eyes or wrinkles?
The Human Genome Project predicts a map of every gene in the body inside ten
years. Already inherited deafness, cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia
have been linked to single genes; and now the genes which cause inherited
breast cancer have been traced to positions on the chromosome, give or take
half a million pairs.
Tudge's book follows the genre evolved by Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay
Gould: intellectual scientific commentary. As more books like this one
emerge, we should recognise that 'intellectual' and 'scientist' are
gradually and rightly converging in the public mind. The arty side of CP
Snow's 'Two Cultures' will have to adapt to survive in a hostile world.
