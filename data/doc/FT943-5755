FT  02 SEP 94 / Women 'lose out' in heart treatment
Women heart attack sufferers are receiving inferior treatment and are less
likely to survive than men, research suggests today.
Two papers published in this week's British Medical Journal show they may
not be getting the best possible drugs, unlike their male counterparts.
A study of more than 800 patients admitted to a coronary care unit at a
London hospital found women were twice as likely to die in the first six
months as men were. One-in-three women died compared with one-in-six men.
Although the women tended to be older, researchers said this only partly
accounted for their increased risk, which was higher in the first 30 days
after an attack. Women were found to be less likely to be treated with
protective drugs when discharged from hospital and less likely to receive
drugs to counter clotting.
In a second study researchers from University Hospital, Nottingham, found
that elderly women are less likely to receive the best possible treatment
after a heart attack than men of the same age.
The elderly women in the survey - based on an examination of 7,850 patients
 -received fewer drugs to deal with clotting when admitted and fewer
preventative drugs when discharged than the men.
