 



Assessment Branch (HCJ23).

collection for data analysis; (2) acts as liaison with program statisticians, epidemiologists, and/or public health
advisors on all aspects of data collection and quality assurance for each Program study, survey, and surveillance
system; (3) determines the most appropriate implementation procedure for data management activities; (4) performs
coding and editing, and arranges for data input either in-house or through an outside vendor; (5) establishes and
evaluates data quality control measures to assure that all Program studies, surveys and surveillance systems adhere
to the established standards and procedures from data collection to the point of data analysis; (6) provides documented
datasets upon completion of studies and surveys; (7) directs the assessment of immunization levels for the national
population and specific population subsequents; (8) collaborates with the National Center for Health Statistics,
and other CIOs as necessary, in the conduct of household probability surveys, random digit dialing surveys, and other
types of surveys to measure immunization coverage; (9) develops and maintains liaison with external groups regarding
assessment; (10) collects, tabulates, and analyzes immunization assessment data, including sample survey data,
complete census counts at school entrance, monthly and/or quarterly vaccine administration reports, and the biologic
reports from manufacturers. 



Statistical Analysis Branch (HCJ24). 

(1) Provides technical support and consultation to the Program and to State and local health departments regarding
statistical and analytical methods, data collection for epidemic investigations of childhood and adult vaccine-preventable
diseases, review and/or preparation of protocols for special study situations such as vaccine trials, vaccine efficacy
studies, etc., and vaccine safety surveillance; (2) provides statistical consultation and performs primary statistical
analysis, including experimental design, for the research activities of the Program; (3) designs sample surveys
for epidemiologies investigations for childhood and adult vaccine-preventable diseases; (4) performs statistical
computations and applies appropriate statistical procedures in analysis of routine, non-research-related data;
(5) maintains liaison with and provides statistical consultation to national, State, local, and international
agencies relative to immunization statistical activities; (6) evaluates the effectiveness of relevant Program
and grantee statistical analyses operations; (7) participates in and provides analytical expertise relative to
on-site investigations. 



Epidemiology and Surveillance Division (HCJ3).

 (1) Directs all Program activities regarding epidemiology, national surveillance, research and technical consultation
for pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and the vaccines and toxoids to
prevent these diseases, has the lead responsibility for vaccine safety, and takes an active role in the development
of policy related to the epidemiology and surveillance of vaccine-preventable diseases; (2) collaborates with
other CDC CIOs in epidemiologic and national surveillance activities for 

Haemophilus influenzae 

type b disease; (3) provides medical and epidemiologic expertise and collaborates with other CDC CIOs in developing
strategies to enhance immunization coverage of adults, including influenza, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, measles,
mumps, and rubella vaccines and combined tetanus and diphtheria toxoids; (4) directs national surveillance of diphtheria,
pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, congenital rubella, varicella, complications arising from
these diseases, and adverse events following vaccination; (5) monitors vaccine safety, and conducts scientific
research to evaluate the safety of all currently available and new vaccines; (6) develops strategies for designated
national and international vaccine-preventable disease control programs and/or disease elimination activities;
(7) provides epidemic aid in collaboration with other CDC CIOs, during outbreaks of designated vaccine-preventable
diseases and consultation to State and local health departments and to foreign countries on these diseases and their
prevention; (8) provides consultation and assistance to public health professionals on designated vaccine-preventable
diseases, vaccines, and biological products; (9) directs epidemiologic research to evaluate the efficacy, safety,
and cost effectiveness of designated vaccines, and to study aspects of vaccine-preventable diseases relevant to
immunization practice; (10) collaborates wit the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the development
of vaccine policy in the public health sector.
