FT  03 MAR 92 / Poverty persists in rural communities
RURAL America from Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta to farming
communities on the northern Plains is dotted with pockets of poverty that
rival inner-city ghettos in depth and persistence of deprivation, according
to a study released yesterday, AP reports from Washington.
The Population Reference Bureau said its study disputes the popular notion
that America's underclass is entirely urban.
'The changing role of American workers within a national and international
economy is at the root of many of the problems being experienced by the poor
in cities and rural areas,' the report said.
'Mechanisation, automation, and the exportation of jobs to countries with
cheap labour are eliminating the need for workers with little education.'
According to the study, more than 3m adults aged 19 to 64 were in the
underclass in 1990. Nearly one-quarter of this population - approximately
736,000 adults - lives in rural areas.
The study defines the underclass as adults who have not completed high
school and who receive public assistance. If female, they are never-married
mothers, and if male, long-term unemployed.
The make-up of the rural underclass is different from that of the urban
underclass. The rural underclass is 55 per cent white, compared with 17 per
cent in cities. About one-third of the rural underclass is black, compared
with nearly half of the urban underclass. Overall, blacks make up about 12
per cent of the population.
