FT  18 SEP 93 / Elite corps ends mutiny in Bosnia
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday survived a mutiny
from his elite army corps when soldiers lifted their eight-day blockade of
Banja Luka, the biggest Serb-controlled city in northern Bosnia.
Mr Karadzic appears to have smashed the rebellion, dubbed 'September 93', by
arresting some of its leaders and winning over others. But the protest
reflects growing splits between the Belgrade leadership of President
Slobodan Milosevic and Serb leaders from outside Serbia proper.
There are growing fears the parlous state of the economy will give rise to
similar protests in coming months, even though the Serbs have effectively
won the war in Bosnia.
One reason is that Banja Luka, the north-western Serb military headquarters
and the industrial centre of the self-proclaimed Serb state in Bosnia, has
been much harder hit by the war than many other regions nearer Belgrade.
The soldiers who rebelled receive the equivalent of DM2 (80 pence) a month -
a fraction of what others earn.
The mutiny appeared to be an attempt to weaken Mr Karadzic, who has emerged
from recent peace negotiations in a strong position.
But there is continuing confusion about who instigated the affair. Mr
Vojislav Seselj, president of the powerful, ultra-nationalist Serbian
Radical party, blames the Communist Party-Movement for Yugoslavia led by Mr
Milosevic's wife, Mrs Mirjana Markovic.
In the first sign of the expected power struggle between Serbia's two
strongest leaders, Mr Seselj has accused Mr Milosevic's closest allies of
'trying to separate Serbia from Serbs living in Bosnia and Croatia'.
