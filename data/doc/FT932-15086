FT  15 APR 93 / Convenient cracks in the wall: Edward Mortimer analyses the
dilemmas and contradictions of European immigration policy
Few subjects are more intensively discussed between European governments
than immigration, asylum and refugees. There are at least 10
intergovernmental bodies dealing with those issues - 12, if one counts
separately the three sponsored by the Council of Europe. Between them, they
held well over 100 meetings at ministerial or official level in the course
of 1992. Yet most went entirely unpublicised, and very few were front-page
news. Migration is an issue that governments are anxious to talk about among
themselves, but preferably without being overheard.
It is a doubly embarrassing subject. Governments dare not admit to their
electorates that immigration into western Europe has not only increased
steadily (roughly tripling between 1985 and 1992), but will almost certainly
continue to do so. Nor do they like to talk about the methods by which they
try to control it, since these are often hard to reconcile with the human
rights they are pledged to uphold.
Governments are sensitive to public pressure for more restrictive policies -
if possible for the door to be closed completely. They know, however, that
this could only be done, if at all, by methods which would be repugnant to
much of that same public opinion.
Most west European countries stopped recruiting guest workers and introduced
restrictive immigration policies as long ago as the early 1970s. Yet
'regular immigration of foreigners' is now running at 1.3m a year, according
to Jonas Widgren, co-ordinator of the Intergovernmental Consultations on
Asylum, Refugee and Migration Policies in Europe, North America and
Australia. The main source of this immigration is the arrival of family
members joining guest workers who are already in Europe. And, as Doris
Meissner, formerly a senior US immigration official, points out: 'The idea
that a person would be denied the right to have family members with him if
his stay is for long periods is simply unacceptable in many nations.'
Asylum seekers, a category which has recently had much more publicity, were
still only just over half as numerous as 'regular' immigrants in 1992. In
fact the notion of a Europe-wide 'asylum crisis' is highly misleading. The
number of applications in France fell last year from 50,000 to 27,000, and
in Britain, even more sharply, from 44,700 to 9,600. The real crisis is in
Austria, Switzerland, and above all Germany, where nearly 440,000 asylum
seekers arrived last year, and the number is still rising.
In 1992 Germany also took in 300,000 'ex-nationals having a constitutional
right to immigrate' from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. And,
according to the German government, about 310,000 people entered the country
illegally - 'nearly 70 per cent of all illegal migrants to the European
Community'.
The phrase 'illegal migrants' conjures up an image of people packed like
sardines in small boats crossing the Mediterranean or container-trucks on
Channel ferries. But much more typical, according to Clara Maria Bisegna,
diplomatic adviser to the Italian immigration minister, is the cousin who
comes quite legally on a family visit, then illegally finds a low-wage job
in the black economy and overstays his visa. If unlucky he may be caught and
deported. But in a free and open society, his chances of slipping through
the net are good.
The problem is not a purely European one. The influx of people into western
Europe is only a tiny fraction of the overall movement in the world. As Ms
Meissner points out*, 'the vast majority of migrants move within their own
countries, the next-largest share move across national boundaries within the
less-developed world, and a relatively small share cross borders to
developed countries'.
To Americans, accustomed to think of themselves as a nation of immigrants,
European reactions seem unnecessarily defensive. Demetrios Papademetriou,
himself an immigrant, was until recently director of immigration policy at
the US Department of Labor. He argues that in the 'new' countries of the
Americas and Australia 'the process of nation-building has never really
stopped', and people therefore accept that 'national identities are
inherently dynamic, and thus fundamentally mutable'. But this idea, he says,
'is strongly resisted by most intellectuals and publics in Europe', and
therefore mass immigration, especially of people coming from a different
cultural background, is seen as a serious threat to national identity.
Mr Papademetriou was the opening speaker earlier this month at a conference
on 'the security dimensions of international migration in Europe', organised
by an American think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS), but held at Taormina, in Sicily.
Western Europe, according to the American speakers at the conference, is
failing to face up to the facts. It has become a region of immigration. This
is not only the result of 'push factors' - demographic pressure in the
south, war and economic upheaval in the east - but also of 'pull factors'.
In spite of unemployment, there are many low-wage, difficult and socially
undesirable jobs which need doing and which Europeans - along with North
Americans and Japanese - are reluctant to do themselves. 'We must accept the
fact,' said Mr Papademetriou, 'that immigration provides us with prospective
members of our societies who use this complement of jobs as entry-points to
our economies and as access routes to the full rewards of our social and
political systems.' Moreover, the present generation of Europeans has not
produced enough children to provide it with the comfortable old age it looks
forward to; hard-working, youthful immigrants will be needed to make up the
shortfall.
In short, Europe needs immigrants, and Europeans, according to Mr
Papademetriou, are in any case too soft-hearted to keep them out. 'Advanced
industrial countries cannot engage in measures draconian enough to control
situations which have developed their own social and economic logic and
structures without doing gross violence at least to the spirit of their
constitutional order.'
So argue American critics of European immigration policy. Instead of trying
to stop immigration governments should seek to manage it, choosing those
with the needed skills and allowing them to come in legally so that they are
not 'compelled' to pose as asylum-seekers in order to gain admission. This,
supposedly, would give states the 'moral courage' to kick out those whom
they do not want - 'ineligible immigration applicants' and 'fraudulent
asylum claimants'. Eligible immigrants and bona fide refugees could then be
made welcome and given 'full equality'. In due course, they would have the
option of becoming naturalised citizens.
Clearly, European governments are failing in their stated objective of
keeping immigration at, or close to, zero. But it is not obvious that aiming
at a higher, more 'realistic' number would produce better results. The fact
that some immigrants are let in legally will not stop others from trying to
get in illegally. On the contrary, through family connections it will make
it easier for them to do so. It seems quite likely that the number of
immigrants coming in will always be the number allowed plus x. In which
case, if x is the number you actually want, or can more or less cope with,
zero would be the logical number to allow.
What no European government can publicly admit is that illegal immigration
is actually more manageable, and economically more useful, than legal
immigration. Legal immigrants, enjoying all the rights accorded by the law
to indigenous workers, cannot be sent home, and will soon be just as
reluctant as indigenous workers are to do those 'dirty, dangerous and
demanding' jobs. They will naturally expect the same wages and conditions as
indigenous workers, and thus lose their main attraction in the eyes of
employers.
Also, most asylum seekers, even if they do not qualify in the eyes of the
law, are not cynically 'fraudulent'. They are usually desperate people,
escaping from what is by west European standards grinding poverty and
oppression even if at home they were not the poorest or most oppressed. They
are also usually enterprising people, willing to take risks and adapt to
unfamiliar conditions. These might be the very skills an intelligently
'managed' immigration policy would look for. But, again, it is convenient to
keep them in that limbo of 'temporary leave to remain', from which, along
with their illegal brethren, they can be expelled if they cause trouble.
Those, however, are truths that no politician could tell in public.
Offensive as it may be to the descendants of the Pilgrim fathers, a little
old world hypocrisy may sometimes be very useful
