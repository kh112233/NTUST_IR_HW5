FT  07 DEC 93 / NHS vehicle hire bill up to Pounds 70.5m
The price of providing leased and contract hire vehicles for National Health
Service staff has increased from Pounds 53.7m to almost Pounds 70.5m between
1991-92 and 1992-93, Mr Tom Sackville, health minister, told MPs in a
written answer.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, said: 'These figures showing
grossly inflated budgets for cars for the NHS confirm the health service is
getting its priorities wrong.
'Such huge increases on company cars, especially for trusts, can only be at
the expense of patient care. The government has increased spending on
managers by 211 per cent since 1989.'
