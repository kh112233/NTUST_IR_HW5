SHORT TAKES; 
$1.7-MILLION VAN GOGH STOLEN 
A Van Gogh oil painting worth about $1.7 million has been stolen from a Zurich 
customs depot, police said today. 
The theft was discovered last week when a prospective buyer wanted to see the 
picture, "Wheat Field With Sheaves," painted in 1888 by the Dutch artist in 
Arles, France. Police said there were no clues to the theft.
