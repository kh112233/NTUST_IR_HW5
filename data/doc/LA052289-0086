BURGLARY SUSPECT COLLARED BY THREAT WITH TEETH IN IT 
It was an odd time for a campuswide announcement over Orange Coast College's 
public address system, but it got a suspected car burglar's attention about 6 
a.m. Sunday. 
"OK, Allen, we know where you are, and we're going to send the police dogs in 
after you unless you come out now," boomed the voice of Costa Mesa Police 
Officer Clay Epperson throughout the campus. 
The announcement was effective. Allen Wilcox, 21, of Costa Mesa showed his face 
to police officers before police dogs had a chance to show their teeth. 
Wilcox and a companion, Aaron Raffensberger, 21, of Huntington Beach, were 
arrested Sunday morning on suspicion of vehicular burglary, possession of 
burglary tools and possession of stolen property, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Gary 
Webster said. 
Suspect Fled to College 
A police officer saw two men apparently burglarizing a car about 5:45 a.m. at 
an apartment complex at 2700 Peterson Place, near Orange Coast College, Webster 
said. Raffensberger was held at the car, but the other suspect fled to the 
college. 
Officers surrounded a section of the campus and were given permission to use 
the public address system, Webster said. Although they did not know Wilcox's 
exact whereabouts, they bluffed a bit when they ordered him either to come out 
of hiding or be found by the dogs. 
Wilcox immediately emerged from the agricultural area. 
"The police dogs are a big deterrent," Webster said. "No one wants to meet them 
on a first-name basis."
