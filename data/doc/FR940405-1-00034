Indoor Air Quality 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Labor.


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of proposed rulemaking; notice of informal public hearing.







</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 By this notice, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposes to adopt standards addressing
indoor air quality in indoor work environments. The basis for this proposed action is a preliminary determination
that employees working in indoor work environments face a significant risk of material impairment to their health
due to poor indoor air quality, and that compliance with the provisions proposed in this notice will substantially
reduce that risk. 


The provisions of the standard are proposed to apply to all indoor ``nonindustrial work environments.'' In addition,
all worksites, both industrial and nonindustrial within OSHA's jurisdiction are covered with respect to the proposed
provisions addressing control of environmental tobacco smoke. The proposal would require affected employers to
develop a written indoor air quality compliance plan and implement that plan through actions such as inspection and
maintenance of building systems which influence indoor air quality. 

Provisions under the standard also propose to require employers to implement controls for specific contaminants
and their sources such as outdoor air contaminants, microbial contamination, maintenance and cleaning chemicals,
pesticides, and other hazardous chemicals within indoor work environments. Designated smoking areas which are
to be separate, enclosed rooms exhausted directly to the outside are proposed to be required in buildings where the
smoking of tobacco products is not prohibited. Specific provisions are also proposed to limit the degradation of
indoor air quality during the performance of renovation, remodeling and similar activities. Provisions for information
and training of building system maintenance and operation workers and other employees within the facility are also
included in this notice. 


Finally, proposed provisions in this notice address the establishment, retention, availability, and transfer
of records such as inspection and maintenance records, records of written compliance programs, and employee complaints
of building-related illness. 


The Agency invites the submission of written data, views and comments on all regulatory provisions proposed in this
notice, and on all relevant issues pertinent to those provisions. OSHA is also scheduling an informal public hearing
where persons may orally submit their views. It is noted here that subsequent

 notices may be published subsequent to this notice, if the public presents views leading to a substantial change in
focus or it is otherwise determined to be appropriate.
