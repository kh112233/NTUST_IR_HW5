TREATMENT FOR HEPATITIS B FOUND 
Interferon is the first treatment to relieve and even cure lingering hepatitis 
B infections, the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer and one of the 
world's biggest killers, researchers have found. 
A study to appear in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine found that 
injections of the natural protein can stop the hepatitis B virus from 
destroying the liver in almost half of the patients who are chronically 
infected. One in 10 is cured. 
Until now, there has been no treatment for the hepatitis B virus. While 
interferon clearly does not help everyone, having any therapy at all is 
considered to be an important step in controlling this infection.
