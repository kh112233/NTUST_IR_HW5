FT  13 JAN 94 / Labour fears cuts in travel security
The Labour party said yesterday that it had received leaked documents
showing that ministers planned to reduce airport security as part of their
drive to relax regulations which are a burden to business.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow transport secretary, said he had received a
Department of Trade and Industry document which criticised the effect on the
aviation business of an 'overly belt-and-braces approach' by security staff.
DTI officials said Labour's claim was 'scaremongering'.
