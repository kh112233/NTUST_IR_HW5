FT  20 SEP 93 / 'Ombudsman' panel in view
WORLD BANK directors are expected to agree tomorrow to set up a new
inspection panel to serve both as a form of ombudsman for outside complaints
and as an internal check on management, writes George Graham in Washington.
The panel would set a precedent for international organisations to allow
outside complaints, although it falls short of some of the demands of US
environmental groups, which have been among the World Bank's most vocal
critics.
The panel can only hear complaints about the Bank's failure to follow its
own procedures or policies, not about the content of those policies. Among
other changes, the new draft increases the panel's proposed budget to
Dollars 1.5m from Dollars 600,000, with three panel members, two of whom may
initially serve only part-time.
