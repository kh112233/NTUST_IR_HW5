FT  01 OCT 93 / Jordanian editor faces charges: Newspaper reported alleged
coup plot against king
JORDAN has charged a newspaper editor with contempt of court over coverage
of an alleged coup plot against King Hussein days after arresting a reporter
for the same offence, Reuter reports from Amman.
Mr Mohammed Hijazi, state security court prosecutor, said Mr Jamil al-Nimri,
editor of the Arabic-language weekly al-Ahali, would appear in civil court
on charges of contempt of the judiciary, publishing court proceedings
influencing a trial and breaching publications laws.
He said a reporter for the newspaper held in jail for interrogation since
Sunday on the same charges was released on bail yesterday.
Mr Nimri had been charged because he was responsible for the newspaper's
coverage, he added. Ten people, including five military cadets, are standing
trial on charges of plotting to kill King Hussein in an alleged Moslem
fundamentalist-inspired coup.
A new press law restricts journalists from reporting full details of
testimony and other statements in the open court. The vaguely-worded law has
been open to interpretation by news organisations.
