KEENAN TRIED TO WIN RELEASE OF 2ND HOSTAGE; 
CAPTIVES: THE TEACHER TOLD DOCTORS IN DUBLIN THAT HE SOUGHT TO INSIST ON 
FREEDOM FOR BRITISH JOURNALIST JOHN MCCARTHY. 
Teacher Brian Keenan, released from captivity in Beirut on Friday, had told his 
captors he did not want to be released unless British journalist John McCarthy 
was freed also. 
"He said 'No,' he would not go without John McCarthy. 
There was a big argument back and forth about it -- but he had no option," said 
Dr. Sean Blake, who examined Keenan on his arrival here. 
The 39-year-old Irishman received a tumultuous welcome in Dublin on Saturday 
night. Doctors said he was suffering from malnutrition but should bounce back 
to health soon. But Frank H. Reed, the American freed last April in Beirut, 
warned Keenan that the psychological wounds of such an ordeal may not heal 
quickly. 
Blake recounted what Keenan told him about his 52 months in captivity, mostly 
confined to a very small basement room: 
"He was chained up some of the time. He was very hot and there were mosquitoes. 
He was bitten all over," Blake told BBC Radio Ulster. He tasted no meat for 
four years, the physician added. 
McCarthy, 33, of London-based Worldwide Television News, has been held more 
than four years. Keenan, on his release to Syrian authorities in Damascus, 
said: "I saw John McCarthy only two nights ago. He is well. John's great sense 
of humor was very much appreciated." 
Keenan also reported seeing two American hostages, Terry Anderson of the 
Associated Press and Thomas Sutherland, an academic. Keenan said that both men 
were well. 
Reed, who flew by Concorde from the United States to greet Keenan in Dublin, 
warned of the psychological aftermath that Keenan might face.
