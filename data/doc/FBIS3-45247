  [Text] Shenyang, January 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists 
have developed a new technological process for dressing tailings 
of ferrous metal ores, which is said to be internationally 
advanced. 
  The process has passed state appraisal and been patented. 
  Experts noted that the technological process will play an 
important role in saving and more effectively utilizing mineral 
resources. 
  The new process was developed by the Benxi Iron and Steel 
Company's Waitoushan iron ore mine in northeast China's Liaoning 
Province. After years of efforts, scientists at the mine 
developed a magnetic plant and a technological process including 
milling and concentrating, which is of low cost and without 
pollution. By using the equipment and the technological 
process, iron and steel works can recover low-content magnetic 
iron ore powder from the slurry of tailings. 
  With trial use of the new equipment and technological 
process, Benxi Iron and Steel Company has recovered over 30,000 
tons of iron ore concentrates with the grade rate reaching as 
high as 65 percent, making 1.5 million yuan profits. 
  Most of the ferrous metal ores in China are low grade ones. 
During the process of the usual magnetic dressing, about seven 
percent of the iron ore concentrates is cast away with the 
tailings. At present, China has over 30 large magnetic dressing 
plants, which cast away over 54 million tons of tailings slurry. 
  If the newly-developed technological process is adopted by 
all the large magnetic dressing plants throughout the country, a 
total of 1.3 million tons of iron ore concentrates will be 
recovered, thus earning more than 200 million yuan a year.
