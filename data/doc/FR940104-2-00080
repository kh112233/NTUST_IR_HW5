<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 As required by law, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hereby gives notice that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,
under the authority granted by the Agent Orange Act of 1991, has determined that a presumption of service connection
based on exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era is not warranted for the following
conditions: Prostate cancer, peripheral neuropathy, hepatobiliary cancers, bone cancers, female reproductive
cancers, renal cancers, testicular cancer, leukemia, abnormal sperm parameters and infertility, cognitive and
neuropsychiatric disorders, motor/coordination dysfunction, metabolic and digestive disorders, immune system
disorders, circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders (other than lung cancer), nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer,
skin cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, bladder cancer, brain tumors, and any other condition for which the Secretary
has not specifically determined a presumption of service connection is warranted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 3 of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Public Law 1024, 105 Stat. 11 (1991), directed the Secretary to enter
into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review the scientific evidence concerning the association
between exposure to herbicides used in support of military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era and each disease suspected to be associated with such exposure. Congress mandated that NAS determine, to the extent
possible, (1) whether there is a statistical association between the suspect diseases and herbicide exposure, taking
into account the strength of the scientific evidence and the appropriateness of the methods used to detect the association;
(2) the increased risk of disease among individuals exposed to herbicides during service in the Republic of Vietnam
during the Vietnam era; and (3) whether there is a plausible biological mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship
between herbicide exposure and the suspect disease.


Section 2 of Public Law 1024 provides that whenever the Secretary determines, based on sound medical and scientific
evidence, that a positive association (i.e., the credible evidence for the association is equal to or outweighs the
credible evidence against the association) exists between exposure of humans to an herbicide agent (i.e., a chemical
in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during
the Vietnam era) and a disease, the Secretary will publish regulations establishing presumptive service connection
for that disease. If the Secretary determines that a presumption of service connection is not warranted, he will publish
a notice of that determination, which includes an explanation of the scientific basis for that determination.
Although Public Law 1024 does not define ``credible'', it does instruct the Secretary to ``take into consideration
whether the results are statistically significant, are capable of replication, and withstand peer review.'' Simply
comparing the number of studies which report a positive relative risk to the number of studies which report a negative
relative risk for a particular condition is not a valid method for determining whether the weight of evidence overall
supports a finding that there is or is not a positive association between herbicide exposure and the subsequent development
of the particular condition. Because of differences in statistical significance, confidence levels, control for
confounding factors, etc., some studies are clearly more credible than others, and the Secretary has given them more
weight in evaluating the overall credibility of the evidence concerning specific diseases.
After reviewing approximately 6,420 abstracts of scientific or medical articles and selecting approximately 230
epidemiologic studies for detailed analysis, consulting with outside experts, and conducting public hearings,
NAS issued a report, entitled ``Veterans and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam'', on July
27, 1993. The Secretary announced that same day that he had concluded that a positive association exists between exposure
to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea
tarda. Proposed regulations were published in the 

Federal Register

 on September 28, 1993 (See 58 FR 5052830). The Secretary also announced that VA would review the remaining findings
in the NAS report to determine whether a positive association exists between herbicide exposure and any other conditions.
That review has been completed and this notice, pursuant to Public Law 1024, conveys the Secretary's determination
that there is no positive association between herbicide exposure and prostate cancer, peripheral neuropathy, hepatobiliary
cancers, bone cancers, female reproductive cancers, renal cancers, testicular cancer, leukemia, abnormal sperm
parameters and infertility, cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, motor/coordination dysfunction, metabolic
and digestive disorders, immune system disorders, circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders (other than lung
cancer), nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer, skin cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, bladder cancer, brain tumors, and
any other condition for which the Secretary has not specifically determined a presumption of service connection
is warranted.
