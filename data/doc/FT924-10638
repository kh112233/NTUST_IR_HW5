FT  30 OCT 92 / Russia will need Dollars 22bn official aid
RUSSIA will require at least Dollars 22bn (Pounds 13.4bn) in official aid
next year to meet its balance of payment requirements, Mr Richard Erb,
deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said yesterday.
Even this huge figure assumed that the Russian government would
significantly tighten monetary and fiscal policies by the end of this year.
Mr Erb was speaking at a conference in Tokyo on assistance to 12 of the 15
states which were formerly part of the Soviet Union. The conference, which
concludes today, is the third and last in a series of multilateral meetings
that began in Washington in January.
Participants from the 70 nations at the conference expressed a strong desire
to move beyond the relatively ad hoc arrangements drawn up at the Washington
conference in which five working groups, covering food, medicine, energy,
shelter and technical assistance, co-ordinated aid to all the 12 republics.
The conference is today expected to endorse proposals aimed at giving the
World Bank responsibility for establishing consultative groups that will
help channel aid to individual countries.
Baroness Chalker, UK overseas development minister, addressing the
conference as president on behalf of the EC, said 'the pattern of World
Bank-chaired consultative groups provides one tried and tested method' of
aid.
While the aim of the conference was to establish structures through which to
channel long-term aid, there is also growing concern about shortages of
food, medicine, and housing this winter. Japan yesterday pledged Dollars
100m in new emergency aid, and the US said it would provide Dollars 260m in
grant food aid.
This coincided with a fresh warning in Moscow of imminent hyperinflation and
an announcement that millions of people would have to be evacuated from
Russia's Arctic north for lack of state subsidies to keep propping up
particularly inefficient enterprises there.
