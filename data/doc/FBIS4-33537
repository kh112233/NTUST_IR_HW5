  [Text] Havana, 7 Jun (EFE) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry 
today confirmed that the crew of a Coast Guard vessel fired 
several shots at a boat that had illegally sailed from Mariel, 
approximately 30 km from Havana. 
  During a scheduled meeting with the media, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Miguel Alfonso said the boat and the crew had been 
seized earlier "and this represents an act of piracy and 
kidnapping." Alfonso added that "there are certain elements 
that make us think this was a planned action" because the people 
who seized the vessel "tied up some of the crew members." The 
Foreign Ministry spokesman added that "the Coast Guard vessel 
pursued them, we fired some shots; I do not know if they also 
fired shots, and after a while the pursuit ended." 
  Alfonso did not say how many people were on the boat, 
whether 
anyone was wounded, or whether some of the crew members were 
involved in this action. The spokesman did say, however, that 
the boat, and some of the crew members, are now back in Cuba. 
  According to statements made by the escapees on arrival in 
the United States, there were 61 people on board. Four of them, 
including a child, were wounded when the Coast Guard crew opened 
fire on them.
