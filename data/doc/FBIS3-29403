  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- The electric power industry 
is gearing up to introduce mixed oxide fuel, made up of uranium 
and plutonium, in light water nuclear power reactors as early as 
1998, industry sources said Thursday [17 February]. Currently 
such nuclear plants are driven by enriched uranium. 
  The end of the Cold War has spurred greater interest in use 
of surplus plutonium as fuel for nuclear power stations, the 
sources said. 
  Japan's nine major electricity utilities and Japan Atomic 
Power Co. will select at least one power plant in which the 
mixed oxide fuel will be used, the sources said. They said 
mixed oxide fuel will account for one-third or one- quarter of 
the total fuel for nuclear power stations. 
  Japan Atomic Power was jointly established by the nine power 
firms and the semigovernmental Electric Power Development Co. in 
1957. 
  The power industry plans to use 30 tons of plutonium to be 
obtained from Britain and France for such fuel. Japan has 
entrusted the two European countries to reprocess spent nuclear 
fuel. 
  Tokyo Electric Power Co. and Kansai Electric Power Co. had 
planned to introduce mixed oxide fuel for a boiling water 
reactor and pressurized water reactor, respectively, on a trial 
basis in the middle of the 1990s. 
  The plans have made little headway, however, prompting the 
10 
companies to consider using the fuel for a light water reactor 
in a move to rein in the generation of surplus plutonium, the 
sources said.
