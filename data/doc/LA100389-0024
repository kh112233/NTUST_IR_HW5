Leftist Peruvian guerrillas exploded 12 bombs and launched attacks that left 
seven people, including three police officers, dead near a resort where a 
summit meeting of Latin American leaders takes place next week, officials said. 
Police blamed Maoist guerrillas of the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) movement 
for the attack on Palpa, about 50 miles from the resort of Ica. Rebels also 
killed the acting mayor of the northern provincial capital of Huamachuco as he 
stood in front of his home, police said. In another attack, seven police 
officers and four other people were wounded in a market in the capital, Lima. 
Sendero has killed about 20 mayors throughout Peru since late May in an effort 
to frighten people out of running for office in November elections.
