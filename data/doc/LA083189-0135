AUSTRIAN TRAINS COLLIDE 
Two passenger trains collided head-on in western Austria on Wednesday, killing 
at least one person and injuring 27 others, a railway spokesman said. 
Three cars derailed when the trains crashed while traveling at relatively low 
speeds between Bregenz, capital of Voralberg province, and the small town of 
Wolfurt, the spokesman said.
