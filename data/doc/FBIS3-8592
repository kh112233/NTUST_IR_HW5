  [Text] Bratislava, March 11 (CTK) -- Premier Vladimir 
Meciar accused the army of the former Czechoslovak Republic of 
preparing an attack against Slovakia. 
  He said he deduced this from a talk with former 
Chief-of-Staff of the Czechoslovak Army Karel Pezl, during which 
negotiations on division of the state were underway. 
  He stated that he and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus managed to 
resolve the situation politically. 
  "During a session of the federal army General Staff I asked 
Pezl whether he could give me a pledge that the staff officers 
were not preparing a military attack plan against Slovakia. He 
sweated something terrible and said he could not," Meciar 
reported. 
  "There are other indications as well that this had been 
contemplated," Meciar stated, adding that it does Klaus honor 
that they were able to resolve the problem within 24 hours.
