  [Excerpt] Tunis -- President Yasir 'Arafat has disclosed 
the formation of a "regional order" in the region comprising 
Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. However, he emphasized 
that Riyadh is wavering in joining this order because it 
excludes Syria from any regional arrangements in the region. 
  President 'Arafat proposed that a 
Jordanian-Palestinian-Syrian bloc be formed to impose itself on 
this order whose foundations were established during recent 
visits to Turkey by Israeli President 'Ezer Weizman and Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak. 
  'Arafat made this disclosure at his meeting with King Husayn 
during his short visit to Amman on 10 February after signing the 
Cairo agreement with Israel. 
  President 'Arafat asked King Husayn to exert his efforts in 
mediating between the PLO and Syria with the aim of rebuilding 
the bridges of confidence between Damascus and the PLO. A 
senior Palestinian official who participated in the 
Jordanian-Palestinian summit talks has stressed that steps have 
been taken toward Palestinian-Syrian reconciliation. [passage
