<F P=106> [Report by V. Aron: "Belarusian Obligations for 1993 On </F>
Reduction of Conventional Weapons and Equipment Have Been 
Implemented"] 
  [Text] Colonel-General Pavel Kozlovskiy, Belarusian defense 
minister, has issued an order "On Results of Implementation of 
Treaties and Agreements on Disarmament and Reduction of 
Conventional Weapons and Equipment in 1993." The order says 
that the Republic of Belarus has implemented its obligations for 
1993 on the reduction of conventional weapons and equipment. 
Appropriate information and notifications have been submitted 
to all states-participants to international disarmament treaties 
and agreements on time and in a full volume. 
  In 1993, 44 foreign inspections visited military sites of 
the 
Defense Ministry. Belarusian military experts participated in 
eleven military inspections abroad. 
  All the foreign military inspections confirmed the 
implementation of regulations of the Treaty on Reduction of 
Conventional Weapons in Europe and the 1992 Vienna Agreement and 
noted a high professional level of the Belarusian military which 
accompanied them on their inspection visits. 
  Belarusian defense minister thanked Colonel I. Osif, deputy 
chairman of the National Agency for Control and Inspection, 
Colonels B. Zhukov and A. Orel, Colonel V. Khomenok, commander 
of armored units, and a range of officials, who accompanied the 
foreign military in their trial inspections on the territory of 
Belarus. 
  At the same time, the order says that some officials were 
not 
responsible in performing their duties. During a trial 
inspection conducted by the Spanish military at the Minsk High 
Military Command School, inspectors discovered one nonregistered 
armored personnel carrier [BTR-60] and one infantry fighting 
vehicle [BMP-1]; at repair factory No. 140, a nonregistered 
infantry fighting vehicle [BMP-1] was found, while one infantry 
fighting vehicle [BMP-1] was registered as BMP-2. At some 
military units, the inspecting military were admitted with time 
delays due to the irresponsibility of commanders, etc. In 
response to this, the Belarusian defense minister included 
appropriate remarks to the aforementioned order.
