FT  26 JAN 93 / Czechs and Slovaks to choose presidents
THE parliaments of the Czech and Slovak republics will vote today to elect
their own presidents in the first elections since the break-up of the former
Czechoslovakia.
Mr Vaclav Havel, the philosopher-playwright who had to give up his
presidency of the Czechoslovak state, is expected to win the Czech
presidency with official support from the ruling coalition led by the Civic
Democratic party (ODS).
Critics of Mr Havel among the coalition may vote against him and force a
second ballot. He is opposed by candidates from the right-wing Republican
party and from the Communist party.
In Slovakia, Mr Roman Kovac, who had close ties with the Communist party
before the 1989 'Velvet Revolution' although he was not a party member, is
supported by the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.
He faces a more difficult challenge as he must win a three-fifths majority
to succeed.
He is opposed by candidates from the Slovak nationalist party, from the
Christian Democratic Movement and the Democratic Left party.
