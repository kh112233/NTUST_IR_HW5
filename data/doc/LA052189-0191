LOCKLIN POEM IN BLANK VERSE 
I'm sorry, but in printing "Homage to John Cage" you should not have listed 
Gerald Locklin as its author. I am. He has plagiarized and re-titled a passage 
from Chapter 22 of my nonfiction epic, "Harpo and Marcel: The Untold Story." 
I won't file suit this time, but don't let it happen again.
