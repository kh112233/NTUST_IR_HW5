Procedures when a current resident child has an EBL. 

When a child residing in a PHA-owned low income family project has been identified as having an EBL, the PHA shall: (1)
Test for lead-based paint all painted surfaces in the unit and at the PHA-owned or operated child care facility, if
used by the EBL child, and abate the surfaces found to contain lead-based paint. Testing of exteriors and interior
common areas (including nondwelling PHA facilities that are commonly used by the EBL child less than six years of age)
will be done as considered necessary and appropriate by the PHA and HUD; or 
(2) Assign the family to a post-1978 or previously tested unit that was found to be free of lead-based paint hazards
or in which such hazards have been abated as described in this section. 
(b) 

Procedures when a nonresident child using a PHA-owned or operated child care facility has an EBL. 

When a nonresident child using a PHA-owned or operated child care facility has been identified as having an EBL, the
PHA shall test all painted surfaces of the PHA-owned or operated child care facility and abate the surfaces found to
contain lead-based paint. 
(c) *** If the results equal or exceed a level of 1 mg/cm2 or 0.5 percent by weight or 5,000 parts per million
(ppm), the results shall be provided to the tenant or the family of the EBL child using PHA-owned or operated child care
facilities. *** 
(d) *** 
(1) *** 
(ii) *** Any painted surface found to contain lead-based paint shall be treated. 
(iii) Interior common areas (including nondwelling PHA facilities that are commonly used by EBL children less than
