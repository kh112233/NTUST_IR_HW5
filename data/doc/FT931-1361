FT  25 MAR 93 / Senate backs Clinton tax proposal in narrow vote
THE US Senate yesterday narrowly backed President Bill Clinton's proposal to
subject a greater proportion of Social Security benefits to income tax,
defeating a Republican amendment to strip this measure out of the budget
package.
The White House had no doubt the vote would be close, so Vice-President Al
Gore, who by virtue of his office presides over the Senate, hurried to
Capitol Hill in case his tie-breaking vote was needed.
In the event, Mr Gore's presence was not required, as Democrats mustered 52
of their 57 Senate members to back President Clinton. Four Democrats voted
with the Republicans, including Senator Bob Krueger of Texas, who faces a
by-election in six weeks to try to keep the seat he has filled since Mr
Lloyd Bentsen became treasury secretary.
Senator George Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, defended the
measure as a necessary component of the Clinton economic package.
'Our colleagues are now making an effort to derail President Clinton's
momentum,' he said. But Republicans claimed the measure was an unfair tax
increase on middle and low income social security recipients.
Retired people now pay income tax on 50 per cent of Social Security benefits
should income exceed Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 17,600) for a single person or
Dollars 32,000 for a married couple. The new proposal would raise the
taxable portion to 85 per cent.
US politicians have learnt from bitter experience not to tangle with the
elderly, because they vote in far greater numbers than any other age group.
