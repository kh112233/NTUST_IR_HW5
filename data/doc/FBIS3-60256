  [Text] Brussels, Jan. 5 (CNA) -- A second delegation from 
the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species 
(CITES) is scheduled to visit Taiwan later this month to 
reassess Taiwan's wildlife conservation efforts. 
  CITES spokesman Le Duc said the delegation will be comprised 
of four or five standing committee members, who will deliver a 
report to the full committee in March in Geneva, after which a 
final decision will be made on whether to recommend trade 
sanctions against Taiwan. 
  The CITES standing committee voted 3-3 in a September 
meeting 
last year to postpone trade sanctions proposed by Britain's 
Environmental Investigation Agency, which claimed Taiwan had 
only perfunctorily cracked down on the illegal trade of rhino 
horn and tiger parts. 
  The first cites delegation -- a lower-ranking trio -- 
visited 
Taiwan Nov. 28-Dec. 2. Its report was positive on Taiwan's 
conservation efforts. 
  Murray Hosking, a CITES standing committee member from New 
Zealand, will lead the second CITES delegation to Taiwan around 
the end of January after the delegation visits South Korea, Le 
Duc said.
