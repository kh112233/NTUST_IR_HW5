 

Iron-containing products that are regulated as prescription drugs include iron preparations that also contain
folic acid and that are prescribed to meet requirements during pregnancy. These products are regulated as drugs because
of the amount of folic acid that they contain. These products generally contain 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit.

Thus, how an iron-containing product is regulated turns on its intended use.



2. Legal Authority for FDA Regulation of Iron-Containing Products



a. 

Safety of iron and iron salts added to dietary supplements. 

The act is intended to ensure that all food, including dietary supplements, is safe. The act does so, in part, by stipulating
that no substances may be added to food unless they are safe. FDA has defined ``safe'' as meaning there is a reasonable
certainty that no harm will result from the use of an ingredient in food (170.3(i)(21 CFR 170.3(i)). The determination
as to whether there is a ``reasonable certainty of no harm'' can be made in a number of ways. The two most common are the
existence of general recognition among qualified experts that the substance will be safe for its intended use (GRAS)
(see 170.3) or a determination by FDA that the use of the substance is safe (see sections 201(s), 402(a)(2)(C),
and 409 of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C) and 348)). 

Under section 201(s) of the act, for a substance to be GRAS, general recognition of its safety must exist among experts
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of substances directly or indirectly added
to food. The experts' conclusion as to the safety of the substance for its intended use may be based on either: (1) Scientific
procedures, that is, published scientific evidence that provides the quantity and quality of scientific evidence
that would justify listing the use of the substance as a food additive; or (2) in the case of a substance used in food prior
to January 1, 1958, evidence derived from common use of the substance in food.

Under section 409(c)(1)(A) of the act, the agency is authorized to prescribe the conditions of safe use of the substance,
including, but not limited to: ``*** specifications as to the particular food or classes of food in
or on which such additive may be used, the maximum quantity which may be used or permitted to remain in or on such food,
the manner in which such additive may be added to or used in or on such food, and any directions or other labeling or packaging
requirements for such additive deemed necessary by [the Secretary of Health and Human Services] to assure the safety
of such use.''

Section 402(a)(1) of the act also provides authority to take action to ensure that food is not harmful. It states:






A food shall be deemed to be adulterated_(a)(1) If it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which
may render it injurious to health; but in case the substance is not an added substance such food shall not be considered
adulterated under this clause if the quantity of such substance in such food does not ordinarily render it injurious
to health. 






Using its authority under these sections of the act, FDA has reviewed the safety of various iron salts that are used
in food. FDA listed reduced iron, ferrous gluconate, ferrous lactate, ferrous sulfate, ferric phosphate, ferric
pyrophosphate, and ferric sodium pyrophosphate as GRAS nutrients in a regulation published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 20, 1959 (24 FR 9368). Subsequently, FDA listed iron and these compounds as GRAS ``nutrients and/or dietary
supplements'' in a regulation published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 31, 1961 (26 FR 938). In addition, the ferrous salt of fumaric acid (172.350 (21 CFR 172.350)) (originally
promulgated as 21 CFR 121.1130 (29 FR 559, January 23, 1964) and iron-choline citrate complex (172.350 (21
CFR 172.370)) (originally promulgated as 21 CFR 121.247 (28 FR 4509, May 4, 1963)) have been listed by the agency as
food additives for use in foods for special dietary use.

In a final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 5, 1980 (45 FR 58837), the agency divided the ``nutrients and/or dietary supplements'' category into
separate listings for ingredients whose intended use was as a dietary supplement (part 182 (21 CFR part 182), subpart
F) and for ingredients whose intended use was as a nutrient supplement in foods in conventional food form (part 182,
subpart I). For example, reduced iron is listed as GRAS in 182.5375 for use as a dietary supplement ingredient
and in 182.8375 for use in food in conventional form as a nutrient. Similarly, ferric phosphate (182.5301),
ferric pyrophosphate (182.5304), ferric sodium pyrophosphate (182.5306), ferrous gluconate (182.5308),
ferrous lactate (182.5311), and ferrous sulfate (182.5315) are listed as GRAS for use as dietary supplement
ingredients and are listed in 182.8301, 182.8304, 182.8308, 182.8311, and 182.8315, respectively, as GRAS
for use as nutrients in food in conventional food form.

In a regulation published on May 12, 1988 (53 FR 16862), the agency affirmed that elemental iron (21 CFR 184.1375),
ferrous ascorbate (21 CFR 184.1307a), ferrous carbonate (21 CFR 184.1307b), ferrous citrate (21 CFR 184.1307c),
ferrous fumarate (21 CFR 184.1307d), ferrous gluconate (21 CFR 184.1308), ferrous lactate (21 CFR 184.1311), ferrous
sulfate (21 CFR 184.1315), ferric ammonium citrate (21 CFR 184.1296), ferric citrate (21 CFR 184.1298), ferric phosphate
(21 CFR 184.1301), and ferric pyrophosphate (21 CFR 184.1304) are GRAS for use as nutrient supplements, as that use
is defined in 21 CFR 170.3(o)(20), and removed their listing from part 182, subpart I. However, in the final rule, FDA
did not affirm that these iron salts are GRAS for use in dietary supplements (i.e., in forms such as capsules, tablets,
or liquids) because there were insufficient data on their consumption as dietary supplement ingredients. However,
these ingredients continue to be listed as GRAS for use in dietary supplements under part 182, subpart F.

Even though FDA has affirmed as GRAS the use of numerous iron salts in foods, there are differences in the toxicity of
these various salts.
