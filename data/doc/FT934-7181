FT  20 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Pensions - knowing the value /
Debbie Harrison considers a survey of personal pension providers
WITH more than 100 providers of personal pensions, each offering a plethora
of funds, it can appear virtually impossible to judge which offers best
value for money. Yet in one of the most rigorous surveys published to date
on these products, out of 193 funds, just three emerged with impeccable
credentials.
National Mutual, Standard Life and Sun Life proved their mettle in terms of
strong, consistent performance combined with a low, flexible charging
structure. Two other funds, offered by Rothschild Asset Management and
Scottish Widows, were commended. The rest failed on one or more important
criteria.
The survey, published by the private client department of consulting
actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, is only concerned with unit linked policies -
that is, policies where the unit price is directly linked to the value of
the underlying investments. Managed unit-linked funds, which invest in all
of the main sectors, were selected as the best measure of the overall skill
of the provider's investment team.
The analysis assumed that no commission was paid by the provider, since this
is how Bacon &amp; Woodrow conducts business. Where commission would have been
paid Bacon &amp; Woodrow negotiated enhanced terms with the provider, so that
more money is invested on the client's behalf.
The screening was conducted in two stages. Stage one analysed investment
performance while stage two considered product features and charges.
Commenting on performance, Andrew Warwick-Thompson, head of the partnership
pensions section of Bacon &amp; Woodrow's private client department and author
of the report, said: 'The use of past performance statistics in conjunction
with a clear understanding of how past performance was achieved, an
assessment of the current investment style of a management team and a
knowledge of whether the individuals responsible for past performance are
still in place, is probably the best guide to future performance.
'The objective of this stage of our analysis is to identify those funds
which have achieved consistent good past performance with low volatility.'
Out of an initial 193 funds listed in the performance statistics provided by
FINSTAT, only 153 had five year track records. The survey examined
'percentile' scores where the best performing fund in each quarter scored
100 points and the worst one point.
Test 1 was relatively straightforward and simply excluded those funds whose
average percentile score over the period of analysis was 50 or less. Only 78
funds passed.
Tests 2, 3 and 4 which screened for high performance and low volatility,
left just 22 funds in the running after casualties. At this stage 40 extra
funds which had three or four year track records were also screened. Only
Gartmore's Long Term Balanced Fund passed and this was added to the
contestants for stage two.
The 16 providers with a total of 23 funds shortlisted on performance
criteria for stage two were: Albany Life (Multiple Investment); Cannon
Lincoln (Managed S3); Clerical Medical (Mixed, GMPP Mixed, Fidelity FRP
Mixed); Commercial Union (Prime Managed); Friends Provident (UK Provident
Managed); Gartmore (Long Term Balanced); London &amp; Manchester (Balanced,
Flexible); National Mutual Life (Managed); NM Life (CCM Vanguard); Norwich
Union (Managed, Mixed ULP, Mixed RP); NPI (Managed); Pearl (ULP Managed S1,
ULP Managed S2); Prolific (Balanced Growth); Standard Life (Managed, Stock
Exchange Managed); Sun Life (Managed); and TSB (Managed).
Funds under Pounds 20m were then excluded. 'Clients should invest in funds
that have the prospect of a realistic degree of diversification and of
remaining financially viable without substantial increases in management
fees,' Warwick-Thompson said.
Other criteria included the requirement that the provider must deal via
independent advisers and must be prepared to offer nil commission terms.
Policies that imposed penalties on early retirement or on transfer to
another provider were dropped on grounds of inflexibility.
'Our concern is that clients should be able to take a transfer at any time
or retire without penalty,' Warwick-Thompson explained.
On these criteria the following funds were cut: Cannon Lincoln, Clerical
Medical (all three funds), Friends Provident, London &amp; Manchester
(Balanced), Norwich Union (Mixed RP and Mixed ULP), NPI, Pearl (both funds)
and TSB.
The remaining ten funds were scrutinised on the basis of their charging
structures. The 'reduction in premium' (RIP) analysis reveals on a
consistent basis how much of each premium is absorbed in providers' charges
and therefore not invested on behalf of the policyholder.
The only three 'Category 1' providers to clear this hurdle were National
Mutual Life, Standard Life and Sun Life. Each was checked for financial
stability and administration facilities and was given a clean bill of
health. National Mutual and Standard Life also received top marks in last
year's survey. In Category 2 were Rothschild Asset Management and Scottish
Widows, two of last year's top providers.
The rest of the funds will not be recommended by Bacon &amp; Woodrow for the
next 12 months. Also out of favour are with-profit funds, which face serious
investment problems following over-investment in property, and fixed
interest products coupled with excessive bonus payouts between the mid-1980s
and 1992.
However, although the survey recommends equity based managed unit-linked
funds for new contributions, existing conventional with-profits policies
generally should be left undisturbed, it states.
Clearly, with top providers changing almost on a yearly basis, it is vital
to retain the flexibility to take advantage of current best advice. To keep
control of the timing and the level of contributions it is wise to opt for a
series of one-off single premium policies. If the performance of your chosen
fund begins to lag, it is essential to be able to switch to another provider
without penalty.
However, Warwick-Thompson stressed that the regular premium policies
recommended in the survey would not penalise on switching or early
retirement because of the stringent terms arranged by his firm. This is a
vital point to check with your adviser before committing yourself to a
contract.
Where normal terms are arranged and your adviser receives full commission
the results would be very different. For a high earner contributing Pounds
15,000 per annum to a personal pension from age 36 to retirement,
Warwick-Thompson calculated that total commission payable over the term of
the policy expressed in 1993 money terms would be Pounds 48,589 and the
pension policy at age 60 would be worth Pounds 2,369,440.
On a fee basis the cost of the initial consultation and setting up the
policy on a nil-commission basis would be about Pounds 900 plus VAT and the
annual fee for administering contributions would be about Pounds 120 plus
VAT in 1993 money terms.
Total fees over the term, allowing for inflation and an 'opportunity cost'
to offset the loss of investment return on the amount paid in fees, would be
Pounds 6,724 and the pension fund at age 60 would be worth Pounds 2,626,029
 -a difference of more than Pounds 256,000.
