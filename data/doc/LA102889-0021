SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
Nancy Hoover Hunter, facing 197 federal tax-evasion and fraud charges, spent 
her first full day under cross-examination Friday discussing her checking 
accounts and financial records through 1983, the year before the La Jolla 
investment firm J. David &amp; Co. collapsed. 
Federal prosecutors presented evidence that although most of the money Hunter 
spent through 1982 was from her personal bank account, in 1983 she began using 
J. David accounts to make personal investments and to give money to her 
immediate family. 
Hunter faces the charges in connection with her role as a top executive at J. 
David, which collapsed when investors forced it into bankruptcy court in 
February, 1984. About 1,500 investors lost about $80 million in the J. David 
affair, a giant fraud in which prosecutors allege Hunter played an active role. 
Defense attorneys maintain that Hunter was blinded by her love for J. David's 
founder, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, who became her lover, and was unaware of 
his illegal activities. Dominelli is serving a 20-year federal prison term in 
connection with the investment firm's Ponzi scheme. 
Hunter has frequently said since the trial began in March that she thought 
Dominelli was a "genius" and never doubted what he told her. She said Friday 
that she never had reason to change that opinion, even though she was a 
securities broker herself and posted many of Dominelli's accounts on a daily 
basis, because she didn't scrutinize monthly or annual statements. 
"I never looked at monthly statements," Hunter said. "I just put them in the 
file."
