  [Text] Nairobi, June 15 (AFP) -- A UN spokesman on 
Wednesday [15 June] confirmed that Rwandan rebels had captured 
the town of Gitarama where the interim government was formerly 
based. 
  "Gitarama is in the hands of the RPF (the rebel Rwanda 
Patriotic Front)," UN spokesman Pierre Mehu told AFP by 
telephone from Rwanda's capital Kigali. 
  The capture of Gitarama puts all-out victory within the 
rebels' grasp after a two-month offensive, analysts said. 
  Gitarama was the seat of a rump government proclaimed after 
the April 6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in a 
suspected rocket attack on his plane. The RPF seized the town 
from Army soldiers and militiamen on Sunday. 
  Habyarimana's death rekindled civil war and sparked ethnic 
and political massacres in which up to half a million people 
were killed. 
  The guns fell silent in Kigali on Wednesday after a 
ceasefire 
announcement, but Mehu could not confirm whether the truce was 
holding.
