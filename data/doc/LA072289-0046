WITNESS SAYS HUNTER WAS ANGRY AT BEING EXCLUDED 
Nancy Hoover Hunter complained about being shut out of a closed-door meeting 
conducted in the office she shared with J. David (Jerry) Dominelli at 
Dominelli's investment company, according to testimony Friday in Hunter's fraud 
and tax-evasion trial. 
Debra Hart, former executive assistant to Dominelli and Hunter, said that 
Dominelli occasionally excluded Hunter from meetings in the year before the J. 
David &amp; Co. investment firm collapsed. 
Under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Marmaro, Hart testified 
about a 1983 meeting attended by Mark Yarry, a top J. David salesman who faces 
a 26-count indictment stemming from the firm's huge Ponzi scheme. 
"The door slammed, and Nancy Hoover came out," Hart said. She "was angry, 
visibly and vocally, about being excluded from the meeting." 
Hart testified that her desk was outside the spacious office shared by 
Dominelli and Hunter at J. David's La Jolla headquarters. 
Hart said she could not remember Hunter's exact words, but "the substance was 
that she had been excluded from a meeting and she didn't like Jerry doing that 
to her when she was supposed to be a principal of the firm." 
Hunter is on trial in the federal court of District Judge Earl B. Gilliam in 
San Diego on a 234-count indictment that alleges she played a key role in the 
Ponzi scheme. Dominelli is serving a 20-year prison term for his part in the 
fraud.
