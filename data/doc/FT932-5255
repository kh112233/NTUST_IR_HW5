FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: N Ireland Electricity valued at Pounds 362m
NORTHERN Ireland Electricity, the last of the regional electricity companies
to be privatised, was offered for sale by the government yes-terday with a
price tag of Pounds 362m.
Mr Robert Atkins, minister for the economy and the environment in Northern
Ireland, announced in Belfast that company's 165m shares would be offered at
220p each.
This represents a historic gross dividend yield of 5.8 per cent based on net
dividends for the 1992-93 year of Pounds 16.5m, or 10.02p per share. All the
company's shares are being offered for sale except for a small proportion
for bonus entitlements and employees.
Payment for the shares will be in two instalments, the first 100p payable on
application and the rest on June 28 1994. The offer, with a 100-share
minimum, closes June 16.
Incentives are being offered for pre-registered applicants who hold on to
their shares for a given period. The offer has attracted more than 800,000
registrations.
COMMENT
The offer price lay at the mid-point of market expectations and was viewed
in the City as providing an attractive investment opportunity. The historic
yield of 5.8 per cent compares with an average in the regional electricity
company sector of 5.1 per cent, pointing to a possible gain of between 10p
and 15p when the shares begin trading on June 21. Analysts were calculating
a prospective yield of well above 6 per cent. All this suggests that
Rothschilds and the government are keen to conclude the massive electricity
privatisation exercise with a triumphant send-off.
