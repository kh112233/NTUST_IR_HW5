TWO REPORTERS IN TROUBLED PAKISTAN PROVINCE KILLED 
Ethnic clashes spread Saturday to rural areas of Sind province as 
motorcycle-riding gunmen shot and killed two Pakistani journalists, minutes 
after the pair had completed reports about the violence that has turned Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto's home province into a battleground. 
No one claimed responsibility for the slayings of Ahmed Khan Kamal, a 
correspondent for Pakistan Press International, a small, privately owned news 
agency, and Muthair Naqpit, with Nawa-i-Waqt, a leading Urdu-language daily. 
The army, which took control of the southern province Friday as the death toll 
from mounting violence reached nearly 400, said it needs more troops to 
maintain order. 
The violence in Sind, which erupted May 15, was sparked by differences between 
the native Sindis and Mohajirs -- descendants of Muslims who migrated from 
India when the subcontinent was divided in 1947. Sindis accuse the 
better-educated Mohajirs of taking the best jobs and most valuable land.
