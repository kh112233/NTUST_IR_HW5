SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Martin's swallowtail butterfly, (

Paplio indra martini

), is under threat by poaching on lands managed by the BLM. The estimated number of females in the population is about
20, and no larvae were known to survive to an adult stage in 1993. The butterfly currently is not a listed or a candidate
species. The Martin's swallowtail butterfly is known to occur within a very restricted area within the Providence
Mountains of the Eastern Mojave Desert of San Bernardino County, California. The entire known range is circumscribed
by a three by five mile rectangle. The butterfly is prized by collectors, and its value is enhanced by its rare status.
Poaching by collectors is a threat. Poachers will often collect plants, eggs and/or larvae to be raised in captivity.
Swallowtails are very susceptible to disease when raised in captivity on harvested plants. If larvae do not survive,
poachers must collect again. Since this butterfly is not protected under the Endangered Species Act, this disclosure
will help prevent individuals from attempting to collect the Swallowtail butterfly under the pretense of collecting
other butterflies that are found in the area.




Penalties




Violations of supplementary rules authorized by 43 CFR title 43, chapter II, part 8360, subpart 8364.1 are punishable
by a fine not to exceed $1000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months.
