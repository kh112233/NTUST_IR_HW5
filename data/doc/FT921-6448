FT  27 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories attack plan for regional
bodies - Scotland
THE TORIES yesterday sought to take the initiative and widen the debate
about representation in the UK regions with an attack on Labour's plans for
English regional assemblies.
They also warned that in proposing a Scottish parliament the opposition was
'playing with fire'.
While Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, defended the Tories' commitment
to the union and said Labour would 'fracture the integrity of the United
Kingdom', Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, went on the
offensive by asking the Opposition whether it would impose English regional
assemblies 'against the wishes of local people'.
Mr Heseltine said that in a later stage of Labour's plans for regional
assemblies the bodies would be allowed to vary local taxation. This was, he
claimed, 'tantamount to introducing a regional tax'.
Describing the Tories' approach as a commitment to 'good government not more
government', Mr Heseltine said Labour's proposals would create an
unnecessary and remote tier of government.
Mr Lang elaborated on Mr John Major's comments on Tuesday that in taking
stock after the general election, he would look for ways of strengthening
the union. Mr Lang said it would be strengthened by developing the UK
economy, keeping tax rates low, keeping inflation low and managing the
economy in a prudent and sensible way.
But Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, accused Mr Major of 'blindness' on
the issue, and denied that home rule would jeopardise the union. In a BBC
radio interview he said it was wrong to believe that the union could be
'frozen'.
Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, said the government had brought
'unprecedented' devolution of power to Wales, with policies such as local
management of schools and National Health Service trust hospitals.
