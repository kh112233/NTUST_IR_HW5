SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The inventions available for licensing are: 




NIST Docket No. 90030





Title:

 Improved Monomers for Double Ring-Opening Polymerization with Expansion 



Description: 

NIST researchers have created a new class of monomers that undergo double ring-opening polymerization with an expansion
in volume. When used in resinous compositions the result is a volume neutral curing process at ambient temperature,
and a final product that exhibits high adhesive strength. 



NIST Docket No. 91008D





Title: 

Planar Epitaxial Films of Sn02



Description: 

This invention provides smooth, high quality planar epitaxial films of tin oxide. The films are valuable for use in
chemical sensors, optics and electronics; and the low cost fabrication method is well suited to large scale production.




NIST Docket No. 92016





Title: 

A Chemically Assisted Process for the Machining of Ceramics 



Description: 

A new NIST process makes the matching of ceramic materials more practical and cost-effective. The process uses halogenated
hydrocarbons to machine ceramic materials. This increases the rate of material removal by 40100 percent and
reduces the surface roughness by 4060 percent. 



NIST Docket No. 92056





Title:

 Serial/Parallel Correlator for Words and Phrases 



Description: 

A novel computer method allows for more efficient identification of misspelled words contained in large databases.
The method is readily applicable for improving the reliability of ``mechanical eyes'' used, for example, for sorting
mail or reading Census Bureau forms. 



NIST Docket No. 93001





Title: 

Intermetallic Titanium-Aluminum-Niobium-Chromium Alloys 



Description: 

NIST researchers have developed new alloys that possess superior combinations of room and high temperature mechanical
properties. These low density titanium-aluminum-niobium-chromium alloys could find use in a new generation of
jet turbines, in aircraft bodies, or as metal-matrix composites. 




NIST Docket No. 93004D





Title: 

Method for the Production of Predetermined Concentration Graded Alloys



Description: 

NIST researchers have designed a new process for tailoring extremely thin metal layers within an alloy. The process
allows strength, conductivity, thermal expansion and other properties to be optimized at various levels below a
material surface. 



NIST Docket No. 93026





Title: 

Method of Obtaining High Green Density Ceramics From Powders 



Description: 

This invention is a novel method of preparing slurries of fine ceramic powders in which the ceramic particles are dispersed
more effectively. The resulting ceramic products have higher green densities which makes them useful in many applications,
including high temperature components.
