  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Jordan's King 
Husayn conferred secretly shortly after the signing of the Oslo 
agreement, either in the 'Arava or the Gulf of Elat. 
  Diplomatic sources told our correspondent that Rabin decided 
to reassure King Husayn, in whom he found signs of panic, 
following the signing of the Oslo agreements. In the wake of 
that meeting, Israel began to report regularly to Jordan about 
the talks with the Palestinians and the two coordinated 
positions prior to each meeting Israel held with the PLO. 
  The two leaders discussed the procedures for crossings at 
the 
King 'Abdallah Bridge, which the two states are due to begin 
rebuilding soon. The bridge will link Amman directly with East 
Jerusalem while bypassing Jericho. Our correspondent notes that 
there has been a change in the wording of the 
Israeli-Palestinian security coordinating committee from what 
was decided in Davos. While in Davos the committee was called 
"The Committee for Israeli-Palestinian Security," in Cairo the 
term Israeli-Palestinian was dropped, apparently in order to 
leave an opening for Jordan to join security coordinating 
committee in the future. 
  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat yesterday arrived in Amman and 
reported to King Husayn on the Cairo talks after Husayn twice 
voiced open criticism of the Palestinian-Jordanian Coordinating 
Committee on Security Affairs.
