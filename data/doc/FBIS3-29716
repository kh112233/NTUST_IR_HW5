  [Text] The government is still prepared to send additional 
troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina under the proposal by the 
Organization of Islamic Conference [OIC]. Defense Minister 
Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said however the government had not 
determined the strength of the troops. 
  He said the matter depended on the decision of the United 
Nations on whether or not to accept or reject the proposal. 
Malaysia also needs to hold discussions with OIC member 
countries in determining the strength of its troops and to find 
out their stand on the proposal. Najib said that he would also 
hold discussions with Pakistani Defense Minister Encik [Mr.] 
Aftab Shahban Mirani to find out his government's stand on the 
matter during his five-day official visit to the country from 25 
February.
