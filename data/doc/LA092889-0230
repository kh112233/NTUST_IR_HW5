MOSES CALLS FOR JUDICIAL INQUIRY ON DRUGS IN SPORTS 
Two-time Olympic hurdles champion Edwin Moses, in an interview published today, 
said drugs are a major problem in American sports and called for a judicial 
inquiry. 
In an interview with the West German magazine Stern, Moses was quoted as saying 
that an independent inquiry must investigate the latest doping allegations 
against U.S. track and field stars. 
"The drug problem has spread like a cancer in our sport in the past eight 
years," Moses was quoted as saying. 
Moses' comments came one week after Stern published allegations by sprinter 
Darrell Robinson that he bought growth hormones for Olympic sprinting champion 
Florence Griffith Joyner. 
Stern, in its latest edition, said Robinson had received anonymous death 
threats after his interview. 
Griffith Joyner, who retired from competition in February, denied Robinson's 
allegation and called him a "compulsive liar." 
But Moses, the 1976 and 1984 400-meter hurdles gold medalist who has led the 
anti-drug campaign, told Stern all recent doping allegations had to be 
investigated. 
"The investigation of Darrell Robinson's allegations must be conducted by an 
independent committee with judicial authority," Moses was quoted as saying. 
"All witnesses called to testify must give sworn statements," he was quoted as 
saying.
