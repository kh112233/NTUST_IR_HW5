Trafficking Operation"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 18 -- Italian police have arrested 
ten people suspected of involvement in an international heroin 
trafficking ring and seized around 40 kilos of heroin in an 
on-going operation aimed at stemming the flow of heroin into 
Italy from the Balkans, police sources disclosed here today. 
  Those arrested on suspicion of involvement in the 
transporting of heroin, mainly from Turkey, are of Italian, 
Albanese, Turkish and Macedonian origin. 
  The operation, code-named Macedonia, is being conducted by a 
police team based in Rome with secret service and anti-drug unit 
collaboration. 
  The sources said that, so far, 40 searches have been made. 
During one of them, Marcello Speranza, the owner of an elderly 
people's home in Ostia outside Rome who was reported as having a 
long criminal record, was arrested. His brother, Vittorio, was 
arrested last November when police found 20 kilos of heroin in 
his possession.
