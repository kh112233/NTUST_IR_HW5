'MALCONTENTS' SEEK TERM LIMIT 
A report in the Sept. 8 South Bay edition stated that Inglewood Citizens for 
Reasonable Reform under the leadership of Curren D. Price Jr. and the United 
Democratic Club are in favor of a City Charter amendment limiting the terms of 
elected officials in the city of Inglewood. At first glance this might look 
like a straight enough proposal. However, to get an honest picture, it has to 
be shown who the real people are behind this scheme. 
Some of the United Democratic Club's members are have-beens, want-to-bes and/or 
perennial candidates for every elected office which has been and will be 
available in the city of Inglewood. These same people are now with Inglewood 
Citizens for Reasonable Reform. 
Over the years, as an active Inglewood voter, I have been involved as campaign 
worker and volunteer in several political campaigns for challengers and for 
incumbents alike. This was always done the democratic way: hard long work, 
door-to-door campaigning and enthusiasm for a candidate who had something to 
offer, who had the trust and confidence of the people and whose election would 
make a difference. Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win, but if an 
officeholder does not live up to his promises or if he has lost touch with the 
voters, sooner or later he will be replaced by this process. (Look at Mayor 
Koch of New York City). 
These perennial candidates, however, never are able to get elected on their 
programs or their accomplishments and therefore have to look for a gimmick to 
fulfill their ambitions. 
In the last few years Inglewood has been on a bullish upswing which will bring 
us into a bright new future and will be beneficial to all of us. God help us if 
these malcontents ever get the run of the city.
