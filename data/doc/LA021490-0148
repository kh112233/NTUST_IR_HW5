FAMILY SENDS VALENTINE TO AMERICAN HOSTAGE 
A Beirut newspaper published a Valentine's Day message today to American 
hostage Thomas Sutherland from his family. 
The message, carried by the As Safir daily in English and Arabic, was 
accompanied by a picture showing Sutherland's wife, Jean, and family. 
It read: 
"We send ourselves with special Valentine love and a prayer that it finds you 
in heart and health. 
"May the warmth and mutuality of our caring prevail, 
"As ever and for aye, 
"Joan, Ann, Simone, Jean and Kit." 
Sutherland, 58, of Ft. Collins, Colo., was acting dean of agriculture at the 
American University of Beirut when he was kidnaped June 9, 1985, on the Beirut 
airport highway. 
Besides Sutherland, 17 other Westerners are missing in Lebanon. 
The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for 
the Associated Press. He was kidnaped March 16, 1985.
