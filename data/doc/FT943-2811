FT  17 SEP 94 / Exxon to pay Dollars 5bn damages
A federal jury in Anchorage yesterday ordered Exxon, the US oil group, to
pay Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) in punitive damages for the 1989 wreck of its
Exxon Valdez tanker, which caused the US's worst ever oil spill in Alaska's
Prince William Sound. The award, which will go to fishermen, native
Alaskans, property owners and coastal municipalities, comes on top of a
Dollars 287m award of compensation for damage to fish stocks. The jury also
ordered Mr Joseph Hazelwood, the Exxon Valdez's captain, to pay Dollars
5,000 in punitive damages.
The plaintiffs had asked for punitive damages of up to Dollars 20bn after
the jury found the wreck was caused by the recklessness of Exxon and Mr
Hazelwood. But Exxon argued that it had spent Dollars 3bn to clean up the
spill and to settle lawsuits with the state and federal governments. It has
indicated it will appeal against the award.
