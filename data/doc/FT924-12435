FT  21 OCT 92 / SmithKline rises 8% in quarter
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, yesterday reported
third-quarter profits up 8 per cent from Pounds 252m to Pounds 272m.
A particularly strong performance from the group's pharmaceuticals
operations offset falling or stagnant profits in its animal health, clinical
laboratories and consumer brands businesses. The group's A shares closed up
15p at 527p.
The results were achieved on sales up 9 per cent at Pounds 1.28bn. Earnings
per share increased 13 per cent to 6.8p and 12.1 cents per equity unit.
The company, which generates 50 per cent of its sales in the US, suffered
from adverse exchange rates. At comparable rates, sales increased 12 per
cent, trading profits 8 per cent and pre-tax profits 13 per cent. Pre-tax
profits for the first nine months were Pounds 804m (up from Pounds 735m) on
sales of Pounds 3.74bn (up from Pounds 3.44bn).
The pharmaceuticals operations posted operating profits up 11 per cent to
Pounds 173m. Sales increased 24 per cent to Pounds 709m.
The group's new products performed well. Seroxat, an anti-depressant,
achieved 23.7 per cent market share in the UK.
Mr Hugh Collum, finance director, said Relafen, SmithKline Beecham's
anti-arthritis medicine, was now the third best-selling non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory treatment in the US with 10 per cent of the market by
value. Kytril, a nausea-prevention treatment for cancer patients, has been
accepted by more than 90 per cent of targeted clinics.
Mr Hugh Collum said the group had also benefited from the exceptional
performance of Engerix B, its hepatitis B vaccine.
Older products also performed well. Augmentin, an antibiotic, increased
worldwide sales by 41 per cent. Tagamet, the ulcer drug, which has lost most
of its patents except in the US, declined 4 per cent worldwide.
Consumer brands' operating profits fell 5 per cent to Pounds 68m on sales
down 6 per cent at Pounds 338m.
Trading profits in the animal health division declined from Pounds 17m to
Pounds 16m. The group said markets continued to be weak.
Clinical laboratories' operating profits were static at Pounds 18m on sales
up 3 per cent at Pounds 144m.
The company proposed a third interim dividend of 2.075p (up from 1.875p) per
share and 4.503 cents (up from 4.24 cents) per equity unit.
