THE STATE; 
MAN RECANTS PLEA OF GUILTY 
A once highly regarded Silicon Valley computer whiz has filed court documents 
alleging that he was forced to plead guilty to a scheme of stealing computer 
secrets to sell to the Soviet Union. Kevin Eric Anderson has filed a series of 
affidavits in federal court in San Jose, saying that his attorneys told him 
that he could never win acquittal and that exaggerated national security claims 
by prosecutors led prison officials in Texas to wrongly classify him as a 
convicted spy. Anderson pleaded guilty last May to conspiring to violate export 
laws and to wire fraud. He was sentenced to six years in prison. Prosecutors 
contended that the secrets he stole were proprietary information for Saxpy 
Computer Corp. of Sunnyvale and that the Saxpy computer was a supercomputer 
with military application that could help the Soviets build a "star wars" 
system. They later toned down the claim, saying it was a "near-supercomputer." 
Nothing was exchanged with the Soviets, although wiretapped conversations 
indicated that Anderson thought he could sell the material to them for millions 
of dollars.
