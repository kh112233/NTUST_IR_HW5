<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Citizen Exchange (E/P) of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs announces a competitive grants
program for nonprofit organizations to develop initiative grant projects on the theme of rule of law for audiences
in selected African countries. Two separate projects are detailed below for judicial training and public defender
training. USIA is particularly seeking projects linking American legal institutions and specialists with partners
in Africa. Interested organizations are welcome to submit proposals for one or both projects; if submitting for both,
each project should have a separate proposal.




BACKGROUND:

 Many African countries are striving to create and institutionalize more democratic polities by establishing multi-party
systems, writing new constitutions, holding free elections, creating new legal systems and making a variety of political
and economic reforms. The highest priority of U.S. Missions in Africa is supporting democratization, of which one
crucial aspect is the growth of strong legal systems and legal institutions firmly committed to the rule of law.



The two projects described in this announcement are intended to engage American legal professionals, particularly
judges, public defenders and training institutions, in working with African counterparts to enhance the professionalism
and efficiency of the judiciary and to create or greatly expand public defender and legal aid services in the target
countries. The projects should also promote long-term linkages between American and African institutions.

Interested applicants are urged to read the complete

 announcement before addressing inquiries to the Office or submitting their proposals. After the RFP deadline, the
Office of Citizen Exchanges may not discuss this competition in any way with applicants until the final decisions
are made.

African Judicial Training Exchange



USIA will accept proposals designed to develop a two-way exchange program to support independent judiciaries and
enhance the performance of judges and the administrative capacity of court systems in Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania,
and Uganda. The project should encourage long-term relationships between African judicial systems and U.S. counterparts.
USIA will consider providing funding up to approximately $250,000 of which at least $30,000 must be devoted to developing
or purchasing specialized support materials for participating African institutions. For technical information,
