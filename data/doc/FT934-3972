FT  07 DEC 93 / Buying into Argentina was the easy bit: John Barham on the
problems faced by the new owners of former state companies
Argentina has, in just three years, privatised almost all its state
companies, bringing in Dollars 19.1bn (Pounds 12.8bn) and attracting some of
the biggest names in international business.
Yet many of the new owners have had to learn how to do business in Argentina
the hard way. Turning chaotic state-owned companies into profitable
businesses has not been easy.
Few have suffered as many setbacks as Iberia, Spain's state-owned airline.
Soon after Iberia bought into the national airline Aerolineas Argentinas in
1990, it found its local partners were insolvent. Then it began squabbling
with the government over payment terms. The two reached a compromise only 18
months after the privatisation.
Iberia handled relations with employees badly. It cut jobs by a third to
6,800, leading to weeks of strikes and demonstrations. This further worsened
Aerolneas's fearsome reputation for rudeness and unreliability. At the
height of the unrest last year, less than half its aircraft flew on time.
Now it claims that 90 per cent of flights are on time.
Meanwhile, Aerolineas bled cash. The consortium led by Iberia paid Dollars
1.87bn in a cash and debt-for-equity swap for 85 per cent of the airline,
but has already lost more than Dollars 300m.
Mr Manuel Moran, president of Aerolineas, says that only with the end of
Iberia's battle with the government has he been able to start reshaping the
company. He is enlarging and modernising the fleet, strengthening links with
other Iberia-controlled airlines and developing Buenos Aires as a regional
hub.
However, Iberia says Aerolineas needs about Dollars 500m in fresh funds to
rebuild its balance sheet and buy new aircraft. But the government, which
still owns a third of Aerolineas, says it will not contribute its share.
Iberia retorts that Aerolineas may collapse early next year without the cash
injection.
The new owners of Argentina's former state companies have had other
problems, not least the fact that all were riddled with corruption. Telecom
Argentina, a telephone company jointly run by the French and Italian state
telephone operators, set up an anti-corruption unit after privatisation in
1990. The unit caught a top executive demanding bribes from suppliers. He
was discreetly sacked and the affair hushed up.
British Gas, which led a consortium of local blue-chip energy companies to
bid Dollars 300m for the Buenos Aires gas distribution company Metrogas last
December, says it tried to avoid such problems by carrying out due diligence
procedures and vetting employees' backgrounds.
Mr Russell Herbert, managing director of Global Gas, the company's
international arm, also says he tried to value Metrogas as accurately as
possible before bidding. This may seem obvious, but Mr Herbert says that
'some of the bids made by other companies were startling, to say the least'.
Winning the loyalty of employees is another vital step. Mr Juan Masjoan,
Telecom's president, says: 'The really difficult thing is changing the
company culture - to make it customer-oriented, to decentralise without
losing control. It is very difficult to change the company without getting
people involved.'
Telecom has avoided serious unrest even though it sacked 4,500 employees and
tightened slack working practices. Morale improved because it raised wages,
improved training and offered better promotion prospects for those who
remained.
British Gas found that employees responded well to the company's approach,
less authoritarian than they had been accustomed to in the state sector. Mr
Rob Verrion, Metrogas president, says that on taking over he found 'people
who had never seen a manager. They could not believe that anyone was taking
an interest in them.' Employees even came into the office on their days-off
to attend training courses.
Mr Masjoan could be speaking for all privatised companies as he reels off
his list of priorities: doubling productivity, raising investment in
training and data processing, reducing management layers and internal
bureaucracy.
Nonetheless, Argentina's telephone system remains expensive and unreliable.
As a result, competition from US-based call-back companies, offering 50 per
cent discounts on international calls, is eroding the local industry's most
profitable segment.
Handling the government, the press and public opinion are probably the
trickiest problems of all. This is inevitable anywhere, given the
conflicting interests of companies, regulators and consumers. However, the
difficulties may be exaggerated in a poor country such as Argentina.
In May, a judge ordered the arrest of Mr Angel Zapalorto, a manager of
Buenos Aires electricity distributor Edenor, after he cut off power to slums
to stop illegal tapping into the electricity network.
Mr Zapalorto spent 72 hours in jail before being released. Edenor,
part-owned by Electricite de France, last year lost Dollars 50m on sales of
Dollars 700m, and claims electricity theft cost it Dollars 150m.
As the novelty of privatisation wears off, Argentines are demanding better
service to justify their sharply increased utility bills, particularly when
some companies, such as the telephone operators, are reporting huge profits.
Dissatisfied consumers are beginning to demand stiffer government
regulation. Executives are aware that even though they may be running
private companies, their performance remains a public issue.
