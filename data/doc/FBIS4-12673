  [Text] Tehran, April 9, IRNA -- A Persian daily in an 
article on the anniversary of the severance of ties with the 
United States said that the U.S. performance so far has proven 
that it is still the 'great satan'. 
  'JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' wrote that the severance of ties has 
been 
to the interest of the Iranian nation since it has served as a 
turning point for cutting off all dependencies. 
  The ever-increasing U.S. intereference in the Persian Gulf 
region, Washington's unconditional suppport for the Zionist 
regime and U.S. plots against the Islamic revolution all prove 
that the U.S. still is the 'great satan', it said. 
  Stressing that the U.S. claims over its new world order was 
another indication to its satanic nature, the editorial called 
for the reinforcement of revolutionary movements to help them 
stand against the U.S. aggressive and hegemonic policies. 
  The daily said that the roots of the Islamic revolution have 
become stronger and revolutionary thoughts of the father of the 
Islamic revolution of Iran, the late Imam Khomeyni, have spread 
in various parts of the world from north of Africa to the Middle 
East and Central Asia. 
  Threfore, said the article, apparently the U.S. 
Administration has been unable to check further spread of the 
divine thoughts of this Islamic movement. 
  It warned against rumours on the possibility of 
reconciliation with the U.S. and called on the Iranian nation to 
remain vigilant and continue their anti-U.S. move.
