FT  14 SEP 92 / Latvia and Estonia close to IMF deals
THE International Monetary Fund is expected to approve standby agreements
this week for Latvia and Estonia, enabling the Baltic republics to borrow up
to Dollars 120m (Pounds 60.9m) between them from the Fund.
Estonia and Latvia will be the first republics of the former Soviet Union to
conclude fully fledged IMF standby agreements  - which provide money to help
a country meet its balance of payments shortfalls in return for agreement on
an economic recovery programme. Russia has negotiated a preliminary
agreement allowing it to draw on a first credit tranche of Dollars 1bn.
Senior IMF officials said the Fund was in the process of finalising a
similar standby agreement with Lithuania. Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are
expected to complete arrangements soon. Belarus is also making progress in
talks.
The Baltic states' standby agreements are expected to allow them to draw up
to 90 per cent of IMF quotas.
