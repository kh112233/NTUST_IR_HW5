FT  19 MAY 94 / Biotechnology produces the 'flavour saver'
Biotechnology has given birth to its first food product, the 'flavour saver
tomato,' which was approved yesterday by the US Food &amp; Drug Administration.
The tomato, made by the California-based biotechnology group Calgene, is
claimed to taste better than most other tomatoes and should hit supermarkets
in California and parts of the mid-west within 10 days.
The flavour saver has been genetically altered so it no longer produces a
rotting enzyme. That means it can stay on the plant longer, and hold up
better to shipping. The plant-ripened tomatoes will be grown in Mexico,
California and Florida, and will be available all year round.
The price, said the company, would be slightly higher than conventional
tomatoes. However, the reception among consumers is uncertain. When the
company began cultivating the tomatoes two years ago, some gourmet chefs and
grass roots organisations said they would boycott it. Much of the public
remains suspicious of genetically engineered foods.
One development that does not bode well is mounting opposition to the
hormone BST, which was approved earlier this year and is used by dairy
farmers to increase milk production.
The tomato is just the first of a number of biotechnology food products
expected to hit the markets over the next few years. Monsanto, for instance,
is developing a potato which will have more carbohydrates and less water.
That would mean chips could be made with less oil, reducing fat content.
ICI may soon come out with its own non-rotting tomato. Calgene is also
working on a new, lower fat edible oil.
