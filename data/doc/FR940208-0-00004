 

Section 903 of the FACT Act and Pub. L. 102265 provide for a 
food stamp exclusion for amounts necessary for the fulfillment of 
a PASS. In the proposed rule, the amendatory language for 7 CFR 
273.9(c) 

Income exclusions

 was: ``Income of an SSI recipient 
which has been determined necessary for the fulfillment of a plan 
for achieving self-support (PASS) ***.'' The second commenter 
objected to the phrase ``which has been determined'' in the 
regulatory amendment. The commenter objected to the language 
because it believes that the phrase unnecessarily complicates the 
issue because the language in Section 903 of the FACT Act 
specifies exclusion of income necessary for fulfillment of a 
PASS. The Department has adopted the commenter's suggestion and 
deleted the phrase ``which has been determined'' from the final 
rule. Other than this deletion, the rule at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(17) is 
adopted as proposed. 



Implementation and Effective Dates 



The provisions extending food stamp eligibility to all blind or 
disabled persons (as defined by the Food Stamp Act) who live in 
certain group living arrangements and to include meals served to 
these blind or disabled persons as eligible for purchase with 
food stamps were effective and had to be implemented no later 
than February 1, 1992 in accordance with the provisions of the 
FACT Act and with a December 27, 1991 memorandum to all Regional 
Administrators of the Food and Nutrition Service. 

Also in accordance with that memorandum and the provisions of the 
FACT Act, the income exclusion for PASS accounts is effective on 
the earlier of: (1) December 13, 1991, the date of enactment of 
the FACT Act, (2) October 1, 1990, for food stamp households for 
which the State agency knew, or had notice, that a household 
member had a PASS, or (3) beginning on the date that a fair 
hearing was requested contesting the denial of an income 
exclusion for amounts provided for a PASS. State agencies are 
not required to do file searches for cases relating to PASS 
households unless the question of an income exclusion for PASS 
had been raised with the State agency prior to December 13, 1991.
