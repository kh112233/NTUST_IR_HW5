  [Text] Vienna, May 13, IRNA -- Western media's silence on 
bugging of the Iranian Embassy in London by the agents of 
British intelligence service is another indication to their 
double-standards. 
  The Western press, which a couple of weeks ago, reported on 
the false British allegations of Iran-IRA contacts in their 
headlines, have now apparently decided to ignore the bugging of 
Iranian Embassy completely. 
  This is not the first time that the so-called free press 
agencies of Western countries have collectively decided to keep 
quiet on issues embarrassing to so-called Western democracies. 
  The low-key reporting of atrocities committed in Bosnia when 
compared proportionally, the genocide of over 2,800 Panamanians 
resulting from U.S. invasion, the war crimes committed by 
British forces against Argentine POWs in the Falkland Islands, 
and the mysterious killing of Rwandan and Burundi presidents are 
just small reminders to those with common sense.
