WORLD; 
IVORY SMUGGLING RING CRACKED 
Police have cracked one of the world's biggest illegal rhinoceros horn and 
elephant tusk operations, shutting off an Africa-to-Asia smuggling pipeline, 
officers announced today. 
Police valued the tusks and horns at $2.73 million. Police arrested two 
Taiwanese citizens caught with 29 rhino horns and in a related swoop caught 
another Taiwanese and a South African who had seven tusks and allegedly tried 
to send 81 horns to Taiwan, said Capt. Pieter Lategan of the Endangered Species 
Protection Unit. 
Lategan said the horns and tusks probably were sent from Malawi via Swaziland 
to South Africa to be processed in Taiwan for sale as aphrodisiacs and 
pain-killer powder.
