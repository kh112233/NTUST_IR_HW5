FT  13 AUG 92 / Channel tunnel station plan
BRITISH RAIL disclosed new plans yesterday for an international railway
station at Ashford, Kent, to serve continental trains passing through the
Channel tunnel.
If the government approves the scheme, the Pounds 80m station should open in
1994, providing people in south-east England with a way of joining Channel
tunnel expresses without having to travel into central London.
Plans for the station have met a series of delays. Last year the Department
of Transport threw out BR's plans for a Pounds 140m scheme on the grounds
that it was too expensive.
BR's new and less ambitious scheme, presented to Kent County Council
yesterday, would expand the existing Network SouthEast station to
accommodate international and domestic trains, and give it an international
departure lounge and a 2,000-space carpark.
