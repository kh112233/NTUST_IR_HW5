<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Hardly Objective"] </F>
  [Text] Washington--Branislav Lichardus, ambassador of the 
Slovak Republic to the United States, reacted to a report on 
media freedom issued by the Freedom House organization, in which 
Slovakia is included among "partially free countries." In a 
letter to the director of the Freedom Forum foundation, which 
sponsored the drafting of the report, he wrote: "I read the 
report on the freedom of media in Slovakia and have serious 
doubts about its objectivity. I was unpleasantly surprised that 
Slovakia is rated as a `partially free country," while the Czech 
Republic, Hungary, and Poland are included among countries with 
`free media.' I do not know the circumstances that made you 
come up with such an assessment, but I want to assure you that, 
according to the principles of the Charter of the Free Press, 
Slovakia meets all of the conditions of an open society with a 
free press and should be included among countries with such a 
rating."
