<F P=106> [Report by John Soderlund on the 27 parties contesting the </F>
election and their platforms, "as supplied by the parties 
themselves"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Pan Africanist Congress [PAC]: Clarence Makwetu </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: Central to the PAC's campaign are the issues of 
redistribution of land and wealth, a beefed-up education system, 
affirmative acation and quota programmes in the workplace and 
labour tribunals to rectify the injustices to which workers are 
subjected. It claims to be the true voice of the oppressed 
masses and promises to give them more power over the management 
of the economy, industry and State services. The PAC proposes 
that businesses should be socialised and democratised, and its 
tax policy would attempt to redistribute wealth from the 
"settlers" to the Africans. 
<H5>  United People's Front [UPF]: Mokhudu Ledhwaba </H5>
  Registered to contest: Northern Transvaal 
  PLATFORM: The UPF aims to bring unity to the northern 
Transvaal region's five national groups. The total eradication 
of racial discrimination is the party's first and foremost 
priority in the region's reconstruction. 
  People who have been dispossessed of their land and denied 
fundamental rights will be the subjects of affirmative action 
under the UPF. The party stresses this will not mean apartheid 
in reverse, but the creation of equal opportunities. UPF 
believes it is in the interest of all South Africans that the 
process of restoration is carried out with minimal damage to 
stability and economic growth. 
<H5>  Workers' List Party [WLP]: Professor Ndlovu </H5>
  Registered to contest: National 
  PLATFORM: The WLP stands for the building of a mass workers' 
party. The WLP manifesto says its will institute a 35-hour 
week, an end to retrenchment and a public works programme. It 
aims to build an economy which places human needs before profits 
and involves people in democratic decision-making. Full 
maternity rights, women's health rights and an end to violence 
against women are promises the party makes. It says it would 
build a caring society by prioritising the rights of children, 
the aged and the disabled. Its manifesto says it would ensure 
an end to corruption, the accountability of leaders and the 
building of a united nation. 
<H5>  African National Congress: Nelson Mandela </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The ANC represents the majority of blacks and 
other 
fellow South Africans who deplore apartheid, and its 
exploitative and discriminatory policies, says the party. To 
address past imbalances the ANC has a Reconstruction and 
Development Programme (RDP) which is a comprehensive plan to 
bring about a better life for all the people. Within the 
framework of the RDP, the results of past discrimination to 
specific groups in society will be corrected through affirmative 
action. Africans, women, rural areas and the disabled will 
enjoy special attention in this regard, it says. It argues it is 
the only party with a clear plan to build a democratic 
nonracial, non-sexist, united South Africa. 
<H5>  Luso-South African Party [Lusap]: Manuel Moutinho </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Verenigeeng] region 
  PLATFORM: The major political groupings had written off the 
Portuguese community as being of little importance in the 
election, says Lusap. It aims to look after the interests of 
the Portuguese community in government. The Party was formed as 
a result of the alienation of the Portuguese community in the 
transition process, it says. Further, the provision in the 
Electoral Act allowing permanent residents to vote and the 
system of proportional representation provide an opportunity to 
get one representative at both regional and national levels, 
says a spokesman for the party. 
<H5>  The Right Party [RP]: George Sinclair </H5>
  Registered to contest: Eastern Transvaal 
  PLATFORM: The Right Party stands for complete separation 
between different ethnic groups so that each can live in peace. 
It cites as an example the Swiss system of government where the 
people in the different cantons can either accept or reject the 
laws made by the central government, so that different 
communities with different values can live in peace and harmony, 
with the right of association and disassociation. Each person 
has the right to a private life free from interference and 
domination, it insists. The party supports strong local 
government and limited central government. 
<H5>  Vryheidsfront/Freedom Front [FF]: Constand Viljoen </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The FF stresses it is treating the elections as a 
test for support of the ideal of a volkstaat. Secondarily, it 
will offer those who cannot be accommodated in the volkstaat the 
alternative of self-determination elsewhere. It is approaching 
the issue of self- determination within the framework of the 
elections, unlike the CP which is choosing to boycott the 
election. A principle in the constitution says that if enough 
support is demonstrated for the volkstaat idea, a Volkstaat Raad 
(council) may be established by elected FF members. 
<H5>  South African Women's Party [SAWP]: Sue Millard </H5>
  Registered to contest: Western Cape 
  PLATFORM: The SAWP was formed to draw together women from 
every corner of the country when it seemed that other efforts 
towards solutions were failing, says Millard. Instrumental in 
the formation of the party were journalists Michel Muller, Susan 
Smuts and Millard. Muller was privotal in the forming the 
Western Cape branch which will contest the regional election. 
<H5>  Wes-Kaap Federaliste Party [Western Cape Federal]: Stephen </H5>
Scheepers 
  Registered to contest: Western Cape 
  PLATFORM: Details could not be obtained. However, in terms 
of the party's electoral pact with the Federal Party for the 
Western Cape region, it is required to accept, without 
condition, the policies of the Federal Party, says Frances 
Kendall. 
<H5>  Sports Organisation for Collective Contributions and Equal </H5>
Rights [SOCCER]: James Mange 
  Registered to contest: National 
  PLATFORM: The Soccer Party claims to be able to heal the 
rifts and find a common ground by building national spirit on 
the emotionally bonding elements of sport, music and the arts. 
"We intend being a unifying force in the forthcoming election. 
Through sport, music and the arts -- social elements which have 
historically crossed all social and political boundaries -- the 
Soccer Party aims to provide South Africans with a common 
destiny through a sense of unity, pride and mutual respect," 
says a spokesman. 
<H5>  The Green Party [GRP]: Nathan Grant </H5>
  Registered to contest: Western Cape 
  PLATFORM: The Green Party, which was established several 
years ago, plans to run its election campaign around green 
issues, among both black and white voters in the Western Cape. 
Among intentions is to stop the University of Cape Town 
developing land around Valkenberg. 
<H5>  The Keep It Straight and Simple Party [KISS]: Claire Emary </H5>
  Registered to contest: National 
  PLATFORM: Emray wants to put a limit on the size of big 
government -- "to get it off our backs." The best way to 
achieve this strategy is to restrict its powers to tax. The tin 
tacks of democracy rest on the tax code, thus the power to tax 
is the power to destroy she says. It is the spending power of 
the politician or parliamentarian which must be contained. The 
onus is one the taxpayer to draw the line and put politicians in 
their proper place -- to serve, not to rule, she says. 
<H5>  Women's Rights Peace Party [WRPP]: Nina Romm </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: Stands for the reconstruction and transformation 
of 
society for everyone through focusing on gender issues. "It is 
vital that, in ordesr to have a truly democratic government, 
liberation from sexism goes hand in hand with liberation from 
racism." The WRPP will consistently monitor all government 
policies and decisions and vigorously oppose any that in any way 
discriminate against women and children. The WRPP claims it 
will add a new richness to the concept of what a "multiparty 
democracy" is by giving women an independent voice within 
government. 
<H5>  Workers International to Rebuild the Fourth International </H5>
(SA): David Fredericks 
  Registered to contest: Western Cape 
  PLATFORM: The party is standing in order to make the ideas 
of 
socialism part of the political fabric of South African society 
and to expose and to get people to reject the pro-capitalist 
negotiated settlement. It stands for the nationalisation of all 
the big companies, mines and farms, under workers' control 
without compensation, and for the revolutionary overthrow of a 
capitalist society. It stands for the building of a socialist 
society. 
<H5>  Ximoko Progressive Party: S D W Nxumalo </H5>
  Registered to contest: National, N. Tvl [Northern Transvaal] 
and PWV 
  PLATFORM: No details could be obtained. 
<H5>  African Christian Democratic Party [ACDP]: Kenneth Meshoe </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The ACDP says it represents the following: a fresh 
start, uncontaminated by the past; a diverse leadership, united 
behind common Christian principles to bring hope and vision to 
the nation; a genuine federal framework or self-governance with 
maximum constitutional powers at the lowest possible level, and 
an open-market economy. 
<H5>  African Democratic Movement [ADM]: Brigadier Oupa Gqozo </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The ADM stands for a negotiated constitution for 
the new democratic and free SA [South Africa]. It places a lot 
of weight on the value of an independent judicial system, saying 
many black people have been sentenced in the past because of its 
lack of independence. The ADM would push for the improvement of 
South Africa's international image and put much effort into 
attracting foreign investment and maintaining current foreign 
involvement in the local economy. It would equalise the 
educational biases in budgets for different races and ensure 
equal educational opportunities up to primary school level. A 
unitary state is rejected by the ADM as less democratic and too 
dictatorial. Such a government gives power to a few people who 
govern the people to their own benefit. 
<H5>  African Moderates Congress [AMCP]: Marvin Phiri </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The AMCP believes the country must be managed like 
a company where government positions will be filled by 
experienced, qualified and competent persons with proven track 
records, regardless of their party political affiliations. The 
voters, as shareholders, will measure the dividends of this 
strategy in the general economic prosperity of the country, says 
its policy statement. The party places much emphasis on the 
South African youth and carries this through to asserting that 
Cabinet positions should be filled by young executives. Its 
economic policy is strongly free-market oriented. 
<H5>  Africa Muslim Party: Imtiaz Sooliman </H5>
  Registered to contest: National, W. Cape, Natal, PWV 
  PLATFORM: The party's policies are based strongly on those 
propounded by the Koran. It aims to encourage racial harmony 
and religious tolerance, respect for human life, women's rights, 
honouring parents, the elderly and an accountability to God. 
<H5>  Democratic Party [DP]: Zach de Beer </H5>
  Registerd to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: In a climate in which the ANC and NP have already 
done deals in private to share government after April 28, the DP 
has a more important role than ever before, both now and after 
the election. 
  The DP, unlike its opponents, has always taken an 
uncompromising stand on morality, human rights, social 
responsibility, an open and free economy, clear government 
deregulation, privatisation, free and compulsory education, law 
and order, real federalism and independence of the courts. It 
talks empowerment, not entitlement economics, and has always 
stood up for the individual. It has earned people's trust, says 
a party spokesman. 
<H5>  Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa [DPSA]: T.K. Mopeli </H5>
  Registered to contest: National, OFS [Orange Free State] and 
PWV regions 
  PLATFORM: The party's views are similar to those of the ANC 
with the exception that they espouse a more free-market economic 
policy. It stresses the importance of protecting the rights of 
workers and the need to institute a land reform policy which has 
no restrictions on the ownership or use of land. "The DPSA has 
maintained the principles and objectives of one economy, one 
passport, one citizenship and one democratic, nonracial South 
Africa," says its manifesto. 
<H5>  Federal Party [FP]: Frances Kendall </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and PWV region 
  PLATFORM: Kendall stresses federalism above all. She 
believes in the devolution of power and in direct democracy. 
The electorate should be encouraged and allowed to vote on 
issues on an ongoing basis. The Federal Party believes central 
government should have power only over defence, finance, foreign 
affairs and the Appeal Court. Each region should have power to 
determine its own economic, health and social welfare policy. A 
pact has been struck with the Wes-Kaap Federaliste [Western Cape 
Federal] Party and they have agreed to adopt the FP's strong 
federalist stance. 
<H5>  Islamic Party: Abdullah Gemiedien (not leader now) </H5>
  PLATFORM: At the heart of the Islamic Party's policy is the 
need to achieve recognition for the rights of Muslims. More 
specifically, the party would push for the legalisation of 
Muslim precepts of polygamy and inheritance rights, says a party 
spokesman. In the longer term, it would make the general public 
aware of the benefits of the high moral standards of the Muslim 
creed. 
<H5>  Merit Party [MP]: Solomon Sehkolne </H5>
  Registered to contest: Eastern Cape 
  PLATFORM: The Merit Party is effectively what the old 
Progressive Party was. The goal of the MP is one word -- 
quality. "The principle of the mass is bound to end in disaster 
and that apartheid and peoples' power both suffocate quality. 
We desperately need the third option of merit which generates 
quality by requiring critical measurement of the real worth of 
the individual to count in all spheres and reduces violence by 
demanding the responsibility of the individual and enhancing the 
economy. There is nothing we can do about it before the 
election," he says, explaining how the party hopes to bring the 
idea of merit through its voice in a new government. 
<H5>  Minority Front [MF]: Amichand Rajbani </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and Natal/KwaZulu 
  PLATFORM: Following the provision in the constitution for 
"the effective participation of minority political parties in 
the legislative process in a manner that is consistent with 
democracy", the Minority Front has registered to contest the 
election. Throughout the world minorities, through their 
political parties, are playing a role in government by being the 
pure and effective voice of the minorities, says the MF. The 
party has a 10-year programme to build itself into a strong 
force. Its priority is to get a voice in the provincial and 
national parliaments. Minorities do not want a voice through 
proxies as they are subject to things like party discipline, 
says the MF. "We are here to ensure that any action by 
government and the private sector minorities are not prejudiced." 
<H5>  National Party [NP]: F.W. de Klerk </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and all nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The NP asserts repeatedly that it is the only 
party 
which has been able to admit its past mistakes and work on 
correcting them in a future government. It promises to focus on 
stimulating rapid economic growth, providing decent facilities 
for millions of South Africans and effecting national 
reconciliation. It boasts a long experience of government and 
argues for autonomous local and regional government and a 
strongly free-market economy based on the right to private 
property ownership. More equitable tax policies will be 
implemented and discriminatory policies of the past will be 
reversed to ensure full political and civil rights to those who 
did not previously enjoy them. 
<H5>  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]: Mangosuthu Buthelezi </H5>
  Registered to contest: National and nine regions 
  PLATFORM: The IFP is contesting the election on a strong 
federalist ticket. It has consistently opposed the Interim 
Constitution thrashed out in the World Trade Centre talks 
because it does not give nearly enough original powers to the 
provinces, says the party. It has also consistently championed 
the cause of the free market but recognises the need for state 
intervention to redress past inequalities, said a spokesman. He 
added that it believed an affirmative action plan should be 
implemented. The IFP argues that the smaller the government, 
the more freedom its people have. Therefore, taxation should 
only be on essential governmental functions. It also believes 
that traditional institutions must be respected and has fought 
for the restoration of the dignity of kingdoms such as KwaZulu.
