<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is extending the comment period on the proposed rule to list Gulf of Maine (GME) harbor porpoise to allow public

bycatch rates.

DATES:

 Comments must be received by September 11, 1994. 



</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Comments should be addressed to Director, Office of Protected Resources, 1335 East-West Highway, Room 8268, Silver

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 7, 1993 (58 FR 3108), NMFS proposed to designate the GME population of harbor porpoise as threatened under
the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The final determination on the proposed rule to list harbor porpoise was extended
at 58 FR 59230 on November 8, 1993, to allow for analysis of the 1993 bycatch data prior to final determination. At that
time, NMFS also stated that it would reopen the comment period following completion of these analyses. NMFS reopened
the comment period on the proposed rule on July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36158) to allow for public review and comment on the 1993
bycatch estimates, as well as on the 199092 estimates that were adjusted following comments received at a February
1994 workshop on the status of harbor porpoise in the GME.


The final 199093 bycatch estimates considered those harbor porpoise that are taken in the gillnets, but fall
out of the net as the nets are being hauled onto the vessel, and as a result have not been included in bycatch estimates
to date. These bycatch estimates and proceedings from a February 1994 harbor porpoise workshop were made available
upon request.
The New England Harbor Porpoise Working Group (HPWG) met on July 21, 1994, along with staff from the NMFS/Northeast
Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) to discuss this information. The HPWG membership consists of gillnet fishermen
throughout New England coastal states, NMFS and NEFMC representatives, environmental organizations, and several
biologists from non-governmental organizations who have studied the biology and fishery-interaction issues of
harbor porpoise throughout the GME since 1990. During the meeting of the HPWG, they recommended that the revised bycatch
estimates should be more fully explained so that public review and comment could provide more meaningful input to
NMFS prior to the final determination.
In response to the HPWG's recommendation the NEFSC is preparing a document which will address these concerns and which
will become available in early August 1994. The HPWG further stated that if the public process was to be effective,
more time would be needed for fishermen and other interested parties to consider the forthcoming information. Given
that the comment period on the proposed rule is scheduled to close on August 11, 1999 and that this would not allow enough
time to allow for public review of the document being prepared by the NEFSC, NMFS hereby extends the present comment
period until September 11, 1994. NMFS intends that this will be the final comment period on the proposed rule.
