FT  08 JUN 94 / Berlusconi attacks state media
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier and owner of the Fininvest media
empire, last night sparked a row by attacking the political coverage of RAI,
the state broadcasting corporation. Twice during the day at different press
conferences, Mr Berlusconi accused RAI of political bias and went on to
criticise the organisation's disastrous. 'I think there is no country in the
world with a democratic government and with public service broadcasting
where the editorial line pursued is antagonistic to the government and the
majority of the country,' he said. He said the situation was anomalous and
needed to be studied with 'much care'.
When challenged about his own ownership of three commercial television
stations, he admitted that too was anomalous but insisted he had distanced
himself from his Fininvest empire. He also claimed to have opinion polls
demomstrating the public felt RAI was biased against his government but
declined to produce the evidence.
