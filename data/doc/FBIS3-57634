<F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Charodeyev: "Turkey Closes Bosporus To </F>
Russian Tankers"] 
  [Excerpts] Turkey intends unilaterally to introduce its 
own special procedure governing the passage of civilian ships 
and warships through the Black Sea Bosporus and Dardanelles 
straits. That would be a revision of the international 
convention signed back in 1936. [passage omitted] 
  The "closure" of the Black Sea straits to oil tankers would 
significantly affect the interests of the main oil exporter -- 
Russia. 
  Murat Uzun, Turkish assistant secretary for maritime 
affairs, 
told journalists that the new rules have one purpose -- to 
guarantee ships safe passage through the Black Sea straits and 
"in no way do they imply a change in the actual conventon." 
  According to Professor Kamil Bekyashev, a Russian specialist 
in the sphere of the international law of the sea, the 
convention does not entitle Turkey to regulate the passage of 
nonmilitary ships through the straits. Nonetheless, the Turks 
are constantly tightening up the terms of passage on a 
unilateral basis. Recently the Turkish Government approved more 
than 20 rules restricting freedom of navigation in the straits. 
But there is a great deal of sense in Turkey's actions, 
IZVESTIYA expert K. Bekyashev and Foreign Ministry 
representatives believe. The waters of the straits are also the 
waters of ports, and the ships are crossing a port's territory, 
as it were, so they are under Turkish jurisdiction. 
  The modern law of the sea allows strait states to establish 
rules governing the safety of shipping and protection of the 
marine environment against pollution. Foreign ships are obliged 
to observe them. 
  Russian diplomats understand the Turkish authorities' 
decision to "establish order" in its straits. At least, it is 
the topic of talks planned for February in Istanbul.
