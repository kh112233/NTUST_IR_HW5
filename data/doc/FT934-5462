FT  30 NOV 93 / Majority hostile to Channel tunnel
Three-quarters of adults say they are unlikely ever to use the Channel
tunnel, according to a survey published today by the market research
organisation Mintel.
Fear is largely to blame for the apparent hostility towards the new service,
which is due to start in May. Mintel said more than half of the 1,000 adults
questioned were 'fearful that the tunnel would increase the risk of rabies
and other diseases entering the UK'. Half expressed concern that the tunnel
could be a target for terrorists.
Professional male business travellers, particularly those living in London,
are most enthusiastic about the tunnel but, overall, only 15 per cent of
those living in the south say they are likely to use the service, in spite
of living so close to it.
