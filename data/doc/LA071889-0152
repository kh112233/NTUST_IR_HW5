U.S.-SCHOOLED CHINA DISSIDENT, FEMALE JOURNALIST ARRESTED 
News agencies and sources in China today reported the arrests of a prominent 
U.S.-educated dissident and the country's best-known female journalist in the 
continuing crackdown on pro-democracy sympathizers. 
Police in Shanghai arrested Yang Wei, a member of the New York-based dissident 
group "Chinese Alliance for Democracy," who was released from two years in 
prison last January. Yang was accused today of making propaganda speeches 
during the unrest that swept China from April to June. 
In Beijing, the country's most prominent female journalist was arrested after 
her apartment was searched for evidence of her role in the protests. Dai Qing, 
a writer for the official Guangming Daily, is one of the first targets in a 
crackdown on journalists.
