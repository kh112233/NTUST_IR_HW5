  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Criticism of the deportation of 
Kurds from Bavaria has continued on Easter Sunday [3 April]. 
Participants of a delegation of observers from Munich to the 
Turkish local elections have criticized Interior Minister 
Guenther Beckstein of the Christian Social Union for "directly 
playing into the hands of Turkish torturers." Ankara's promise 
that the deportees neither had to fear torture nor death is 
worth nothing. Critics of the Turkish regime were being 
systematically persecuted, arrested, tortured, and murdered, 
they said. 
  Deportation decrees against militant Kurds were even issued 
over the Easter weekend. Bavaria was the first to draw 
conclusions from the blockade two weeks ago, Heinz Grunwald, the 
responsible official in the Bavarian Interior Ministry, told 
DPA. He added that the authorities dealing with issues related 
to foreigners would work through the weekend. 
  It is still unclear when the first Kurds will be deported. 
Those affected have the right to appeal against the decrees. 
According to the Justice Ministry, 15 participants of the 
Augsburg highway blockade two weeks ago are being detained in 
Bavarian prisons. A total of approximately 500 people are under 
investigation.
