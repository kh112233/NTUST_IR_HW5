FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Health warning - these comparisons may be
harmful
THERE ARE lies, damned lies, statistics, and statistics about health care
spending. Few public policy areas are more notorious for their ability to
confuse and bemuse the uninitiated. The variety of misleading and often
contradictory indicators makes international comparisons of the output and
efficiency of national health care systems prohibitively difficult. Even the
deceptively simple task of comparing the quantity of resources devoted to
health care can be misleading.
The information presented above is compiled from the OECD's Health Databank.
It is collected from national sources and will inevitably reflect the very
different health care systems in each of the six countries included in the
table: whether provision is predominantly public or private, provided free
or via an insurance system, and the relative importance of hospital and
ambulatory provision within total spending.
Real health expenditure can be compared using more or less sophisticated
measures. The UK government uses the simpler technique of deflating total
health spending using the gross domestic product deflator which is based on
the prices of all domestically produced goods. On this measure, real health
spending in the UK grew at an average annual rate of 3.5 per cent between
1979 and 1990. Because UK health spending grew faster than GDP, total health
spending rose as a percentage of GDP from 5.6 per cent in 1980 to 6.1 per
cent in 1990. But the UK's share of health spending in total GDP remains the
lowest of all six countries.
Yet both these measures give a misleading impression of the growth in real
resources that were devoted to UK health care in the 1980s. The OECD
calculates a more accurate measure of the real growth of health spending
using a special health deflator. It is based on an index of health care
input prices: the wages of health workers, ambulatory services, therapeutic
appliances, and pharmaceuticals.
This more sophisticated measure paints a less impressive picture of the UK
government's record over the past decade. The average annual growth of real
health care spending between 1979 and 1990 falls to 1.8 per cent, lower than
the average rate of growth of both GDP and GDP per head. Much of the growth
in total spending was in private health provision. Public health spending
grew by only 1.2 per cent a year and accounted for two-fifths of the total
rise in spending as a percentage of GDP over the 1980s. This goes some way
to explaining the apparent contradiction between the rise in the share of
health spending in GDP and Labour's claim the National Health Service is
underfunded.
Only Germany had a slower growth rate of total real health spending per head
in the 1980s, although the growth rate of UK GDP per head was higher than in
any country except Japan. France, by contrast, had the fastest growth of
real health spending in the 1980s but the lowest real growth rate of GDP per
head.
Yet there is a relatively robust relationship between the level of GDP per
head and the level of real health spending per head. The upper chart shows
them both in 1990 dollars, using purchasing power parity exchange rates to
adjust for cross-country price level differences. The US has both the
highest GDP per head and the highest real health spending per head. The UK
has the lowest level of health spending and almost the lowest GDP per head.
Japan's health care spending is much lower than would be predicted by its
income per head. But the relatively rapid ageing of the Japanese population
over the next two decades may bring it into line.
The wealthier a country is, the more it tends to spend on health care; but
more spending may not mean better quality care. The US spends over twice as
much as the UK as a percentage of GDP; but over 10 per cent of the US
population has no assured access to health care. Nonetheless, the likely
shortage of economic growth in the UK over the next two or more years will
constrain the quantity of health spending, whoever wins the election.
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: HEALTH CARE SPENDING
This table compares international health care spending. Real growth rates
are derived in the first section using the general GDP deflator, and in the
second section using the appropriate health care deflators. The third
section shows spending as percentages of nominal GDP. The fourth section
shows spending per head in US dollars at current purchasing power parities
(PPPs).
