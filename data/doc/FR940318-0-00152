 

(a) HCFC22. HCFC22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12, R500, and R502 in retrofitted
refrigerated transport. See the discussion on HCFC22 under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113,
CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12, R500, and R502 in
retrofitted refrigerated transport. See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal
chillers. 

(c) R401A and R401B. R401A and R401B, which consist of HCFC22, HFC152a,
and HCFC124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC12, R500, and R502 in retrofitted refrigerated
transport. See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial
process refrigeration. 

(d) R402A and R402B. R402A and R402B, which consist of HCFC22, propane, and HFC125,
are acceptable as substitutes for CFC12, R500, and R502 in retrofitted refrigerated transport.
See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial 
process refrigeration. 


(e) R404A. R404A, which consists of HFC125 and HFC143a, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC12, R500, and R502 in retrofitted refrigerated transport. See the discussion on this
blend under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration. 

(f) R507. R507, which consists of HFC125, HFC143a, and HFC134a, is acceptable
as a substitute for CFC12, R500, and R502 in retrofitted refrigerated transport. See the discussion
on this blend under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration. 

(19) CFC12 and R502 Refrigerated Transport, New. Please note that different temperature regimes may
affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. 

(a) HCFC22. HCFC22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12, R500, and R502 in new
refrigerated transport. See the discussion on HCFC22 under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113,
CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12, R500, and R502 in
new refrigerated transport. See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal chillers.


(c) R402A and R402B. R402A and R402B, which consist of HCFC22, propane, and HFC125,
are acceptable as substitutes for CFC12, R500, and R502 in new refrigerated transport. See the
discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration.


(d) R404A. R404A, which consists of HFC125 and HFC143a, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC12, R500, and R502 in retrofitted new refrigerated transport. See the discussion on this
blend under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration. 

(e) R507. R507, which consists of HFC125, HFC143a, and HFC134a, is acceptable
as a substitute for CFC12, R500, and R502 in new refrigerated transport. See the discussion on
this blend under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration. 

(f) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to refrigerated transport
using CFC12, R500, or R502. Stirling cycle systems have been in use for many years in this end-use.
For further information, see the discussion on the Stirling cycle under 
new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(g) Nitrogen direct gas expansion. Nitrogen direct gas expansion is acceptable as an alternative technology to refrigerated

transport using CFC12, R500, or R502. Nitrogen is expanded within a refrigerated transport
unit to absorb heat. The cycle is open; the nitrogen is released to the atmosphere after absorbing heat from the container.
Nitrogen is a common gas that is nontoxic and nonflammable. It has been used successfully for many years in this end-use.


(20) CFC12 and R502 Retail Food Refrigeration, Retrofit. Please note that different temperature regimes
may affect the applicability of 
substitutes within this end-use.
