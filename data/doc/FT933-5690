FT  02 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science:
Nerve-cell transplants may fight brain disease
NERVE CELLS from a patient's intestine may soon be transplanted to cure
brain disease, the British Association meeting at Keele heard yesterday.
Animal studies at University College, London, show that nerve cells
transplanted from a rat's gut into its brain grow into the surrounding
tissue, while at the same time nerves from the brain penetrate the
transplant.
Some of the animals had brain damage which would be a good model for human
degenerative disorders, notably Huntington's Chorea and Parkinson's disease.
Professor Geoffrey Burnstock, head of anatomy and developmental biology at
UCL, says gut-to-brain transplants would avoid many problems posed by foetal
transplants - where cells have been transplanted from human foetuses into
the brains of Parkinson's sufferers as a means of 'rewiring' damaged nerves.
More than 100,000 people in the UK suffer from Parkinson's.
Dr Peter Jenner of the Parkinson's Disease Experimental Research
Laboratories at King's College, London, described the findings as 'very
exciting'. The foetal technique had been over-hyped and produced false
hopes, because the foetal cells had not grown well enough, he said. The best
results were on patients in Sweden but none had recovered sufficiently to
stop taking drugs.
Most of the chemical messengers which control brain activity are present in
the gut cells. There would be no possibility of the transplant being
rejected by the patient's immune system, because it came from his or her own
intestines. And the ethical objections to using foetal cells would not
exist.
The next stage in Prof Burnstock's research will be to discover what it is
about the gut transplant that triggers nerves in the brain to start growing.
Usually damage to the brain is permanent because nerves do not grow back. If
the factors responsible are isolated, they could be used to treat spinal
injuries and other nerve damage.
The UCL research also opens up the possibility of curing inherited brain
disease. Gut-to-brain transplants could be used to deliver correct copies of
faulty genes.
Prof Burnstock said the nervous system of the gut was sometimes known as a
'small brain' because it could sustain so many sophisticated reflex
activities independently of the central nervous system. More than 60 of the
transmitter chemicals it uses were also produced in the brain.
It is not clear how soon the research could be applied to humans. Further
animal studies are needed to find out how selective a transplant's effect is
and how its growth is controlled.
