  [Text] Moscow, 6 Jan -- Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze 
told an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the telephone from his office 
shortly after 1:00 A.M. this morning: Whatever the truth about 
Zviad Gamsakhurdia's death, it is of no great importance to the 
situation in Georgia. 
  Asked about the possible consequences of Gamsakhurdia's 
death, Eduard Shevardnadze said that he "would rather 
Gamsakhurdia stayed alive." He explained: "It was clear to us 
that the former president had long been a political corpse. 
This is the reason the Georgian leadership decided not to 
physically destroy him or his supporters." 
  The Georgian leader continued: "Moreover, many of the ex- 
president's supporters who had been taken prisoners were set 
free after the western regions of the republic were recaptured." 
Eduard Shevardnadze emphasized that "the majority of his 
supporters had dissociated themselves from him." 
  Eduard Shevardnadze did not give a final version of the 
death 
or suicide of the 54-year-old Zviad Gamsakhurdia, though the 
ITAR-TASS correspondent asked for one. 
  He said: "The Georgian leaders learned about this from 
Chechen sources, and it was confirmed by a Chechen delegation 
which came to Tbilisi on 5 January." The Georgian head of state 
said: "We immediately got in touch with [people in] places where 
Gamsakhurdia was likely to be staying, and with his wife Manana 
who is in Groznyy, but it is hard to tell whether it really 
happened this or that way." 
  At the same time, Eduard Shevardnadze suggested that 
Gamsakhurdia might have died in a conflict between some people 
in his entourage because "he started getting in their way and 
they were capable of such a step."
