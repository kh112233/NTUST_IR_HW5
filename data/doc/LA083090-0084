HIGH NUMBER OF LEAD POISON CASES FOUND; 
HEALTH: STATE STUDIES SHOW MANY WORKERS EXPOSED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. 
MONITORING PRACTICES IN INDUSTRY ARE CRITICIZED. 
Lead poisoning has been found in surprisingly high numbers of California 
workers, particularly in high-risk industries in Los Angeles, two state studies 
have revealed. 
In articles published in this month's issue of the American Journal of Public 
Health, officials at the state Department of Health Services report finding 
excessive lead exposure to workers in a handful of high-risk occupations, 
noting that monitoring practices to detect lead in the workplace environment 
are inadequate. 
Under a state law effective Jan. 1, 1987, state medical laboratories performing 
tests for levels of lead in blood have been required to report the findings to 
the Department of Health Services. In one study of those cases, at least 5,000 
workers were found to have elevated blood lead levels that were, in some cases, 
near toxic. 
The survey showed that most of the exposed individuals were male and a 
disproportionate percentage, 44%, Latino. The study showed that 81% were 
residents of Los Angeles County, where many manufacturing processes using lead 
are based. 
Most of the individuals were workers for lead smelters, battery manufacturers 
and brass foundries. Construction, radiator repair, pottery and ceramics 
manufacturing and firing ranges accounted for the remainder. 
About half of the workers were not in routine medical monitoring programs. 
In the second study by researchers at the state's Occupational Health Program, 
only 2.6% of lead-using industries in the state reported they have done 
environmental monitoring for lead and only 1.4% have done routine biological 
monitoring programs. 
In a third, unpublished study, tests showed at least 2,500 California children 
have potentially toxic levels of lead in their blood. 
"There is more of a problem than people thought there was," said Dr. Kenneth 
Kizer, state health director. "The biggest problem is the awareness, getting 
doctors to test kids and think about it as a potential issue. You have to test 
for it." 
As for workplace exposure, laws designed by the U.S. Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration to protect workers from lead exposure have been 
overlooked, said Dr. Philip J. Landrigan of Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New 
York, in an editorial accompanying the articles. 
"Lead remains a serious problem in American workplaces," Landirgan said. "These 
reported numbers, disturbing as they are, appear to represent but a fraction of 
the total problem, inasmuch as only 1.4% of lead-using industries in California 
have developed biological monitoring programs for their lead-exposed workers." 
The lack of monitoring among California industries suggests that cases of 
occupational lead poisoning may be seriously underestimated, the study says. 
"I think in the workplace the problem is ignorance," Kizer said. "It's not 
knowing the laws, on the part of workers and operators. Where you're seeing 
problems is not with the big companies, it's with the smaller operations where 
you don't have the focus on health and safety." 
In larger facilities, monitoring was more prominent. "The problem is big, but 
varies by industry, with the larger, unionized companies more likely to have 
monitoring programs," said Dr. Jon Rosenberg of the Occupational Health 
Surveillance and Evaluation Program. 
Almost 80% of battery manufacturing employees work in job classifications that 
have been monitored, compared to only 1% of radiator repair workers. 
But, said Landrigan, "the number of OSHA inspectors in the field must be 
increased. These inspectors must be allowed to levy severe fines for repeated 
or willful violations. Criminal penalties must be used much more frequently 
than heretofore to punish repeated and willful violators." 
According to Kizer, standards for lead exposure have been changed in recent 
years as research showed that lower levels than previously expected can cause 
neurological damage. Few studies have looked at potentially dangerous lead 
exposure using the new, more sensitive criteria for toxicity. 
"We weren't totally surprised by what we found, but by the same token, we 
didn't have a basis for knowing what it should be," Kizer said. 
But the studies are surprising because lead poisoning is traditionally viewed 
as a problem in the Northeastern part of the United States where many 
industries using lead are based and where older homes contain lead-based paint. 
It is difficult to know if California residents have any greater risk to lead 
exposure than other states because the California studies used the more 
sensitive levels for lead exposure, Kizer said. 
But, he said, lead exposure can be easily reduced by enforcement of OSHA 
regulations. Among children, most lead exposure comes from living near 
industries using lead or from lead-based paint in homes.
