FT  04 MAR 93 / NCP chief 'was assured on moles'
MR GORDON LAYTON, the chief executive of National Car Parks, was given
repeated assurances about the legality of infiltrating 'moles' and other
covert methods used to investigate the company's main business rival, the
jury in the Old Bailey industrial espionage trial was told yesterday.
He trusted advice given to him by KAS, the security firm which carried out
the investigation of Europarks for NCP, that such techniques were both legal
and ethical, Mr Alex Carlisle, QC for Mr Layton, told the court.
These included surveillance of Europarks directors, the searching of rubbish
bins and the infiltration of KAS employees onto the Europarks staff.
Mr Layton, who has chosen not to go into the witness box to give evidence,
denies conspiring with Mr Simon Hewitt, a former KAS manager, to defraud
Europarks by dishonestly obtaining information about its business
activities.
Mr Layton was entitled to reply on the public perceptions of both KAS and
the SAS, from which the security firm had recruited its staff, of a high
level of training and discipline, Mr Carlisle said.
'Whether they (KAS) were right or wrong, they thought that what they were
doing was perfectly legal and ethical and that was the message they gave to
their clients,' he said.
The trial continues today.
