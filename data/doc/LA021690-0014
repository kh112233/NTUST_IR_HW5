LIMITING TERMS OF ELECTED OFFICIALS 
The article states that Hyde has been in the House of Representatives for the 
past 26 years, and bemoans the increasing interest in limiting terms of office. 
I have shocking news for Hyde: Professional politicians are not what democracy 
is all about. 
Hyde states, "People who advocate this proposal accept the logical fallacy that 
'new is better' and must believe that elective office is the one vocation where 
experience is an obstacle to good performance." 
Wrong! What should be said is that long terms in office are obstacles to the 
distribution of power. 
Good performances have always been found in the countless dictatorships that 
have plagued the world during the last few thousand years. Of far more 
importance in a democracy is the distribution of power, which tends to reduce 
corruption, and tends to create efforts aimed at the betterment of all people 
rather than just helping special interests. 
He states: "A mandatory revolving door for elected officials would only 
strengthen the grip of the permanent bureaucracy." This statement defies both 
fact and logic. We do not need "representatives for life" any more than we need 
"presidents for life." Sunset laws for public offices will do a great deal 
towards reducing the corruption so prevalent today, and we should adopt them.
