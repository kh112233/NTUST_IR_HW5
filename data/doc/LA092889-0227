P.M. BRIEFING; 
WIDER USE OKD FOR AIDS VIRUS DRUG 
The government today announced a plan for expanded distribution of a drug that 
appears to be effective in stopping replication of the AIDS virus. 
The plan for wider distribution of dideoxyinosine, or ddI, marks the first time 
the Food and Drug Administration has agreed to make such an experimental drug 
so widely available so early in testing, the FDA said. 
Under the plan, ddI will be available to about 2,600 people with AIDS or 
AIDS-related complex in controlled clinical trials to test the effectiveness of 
the drug against zidovudine, known as AZT. 
The plan also will make ddI available to people with AIDS or advanced 
AIDS-related complex who cannot take AZT, the only FDA-approved drug that 
directly combats the AIDS virus, and those for whom the disease is progressing 
despite AZT and who have no other treatment options. 
Bristol-Meyers, which holds the license to manufacture ddI, has said it will 
distribute the drug at no cost.
