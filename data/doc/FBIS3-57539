Tanks Go into `Battle'"] 
  [Text] Belarus is continuing conscientiously to fulfill 
its obligations under the Treaty on the Reduction of 
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. 
  The next stage -- the first in the new year -- in the 
elimination of armored hardware has begun at the tank-repair 
plant in Borisov. It will last through 24 February. It is 
planned to cut up 92 tanks and approximately 50 infantry 
fighting vehicles for scrap metal and to re-equip them for use 
in the national economy. The work is being monitored by a group 
of NATO military inspectors.
