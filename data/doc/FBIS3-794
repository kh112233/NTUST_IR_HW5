  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] says it will 
continue talks with the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] even though 
it has decided against participation in next month's election. 
The ANC national chairman, Thabo Mbeki, said at Dundee in 
northern Natal that the ANC would ensure that constitutional 
agreements with the IFP on international mediation were 
implemented after the election. The meeting in Pietermaritzburg 
that was to have been addressed by Mr. Mbeki was disrupted by a 
bomb threat. Police sniffer dogs were used to search the 
premises, but nothing was found.
