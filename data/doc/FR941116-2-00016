Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89651;
80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR part 301), we invite comments on the question of whether instruments of equivalent scientific
value, for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the
United States.

Comments must comply with 15 CFR 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory
Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between
8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in Room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington,
D.C.



Docket Number: 

94064R. 

Applicant: 

University of California, Physics Department, Berkeley, CA 94720. 

Instrument: 

Superconducting Solenoid. 

Manufacturer: 

Atomimpex, CIS. 

Intended Use: 

Original notice of this resubmitted application was published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of June 17, 1994. 



Docket Number: 

94124. 

Applicant: 

U.S. Geological Survey, Box 25046, MS 963 Denver Federal Center, Denver, CO 80225. 

Instrument: 

Open Split Interface Attachment for Mass Spectrometer. 

Manufacturer: 

Finnigan MAT, Germany. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for studies of sulfates from the stratosphere and ice cores and CO

2

 gases from ice cores and sulfides from rocks and minerals from variety of geologic sites and contexts. Using laser
microsampling techniques, samples as small as 1 nanomole of CO

2

 or SO

2

 will be analyzed in the mass spectrometer through the open split interface. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

October 13, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94125. 

Applicant: 

University of California, San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, 8655 Production Avenue, San Diego, CA
92121. 

Instrument: 

Seasor System. 

Manufacturer: 

Chelsea Instruments Ltd., United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for investigations of the temperature, salinity, density and optical properties of the
upper 400 m of the ocean. The objectives of these surveys are: to quantify the interaction between the atmosphere and
the ocean, to quantify the importance of oceanic fronts in this interaction, to identify the effects of the physical
processes on optical properties, etc. In addition, the instrument may be used in a course on sea-going observational
oceanography to introduce students to modern techniques of oceanographic data collection. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

October 19, 1994. 


Docket Number: 

94126. 

Applicant: 

The Ohio State University, Department of Geological Sciences, 104 W. 19th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210. 

Instrument: 

Mass Spectrometer, Model 215-50. 

Manufacturer: 

Mass Analyser Products Limited, United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for the measurement of the amounts and isotopic compositions of noble gases (He, Ne, Ar,
Kr, and Xe) for geological and geochemical studies. In addition, the instrument will be used for teaching the theory
and practice of isotope geochemistry and geochronology to advanced undergraduate and graduate students. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

October 18, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94127. 

Applicant: 

California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125. 

Instrument: 

Telescope System. 

Manufacturer: 

Astrophysical Laboratory of National Tsing Hau University, Republic of China. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for the study of solar oscillations to gain knowledge of the internal structure and dynamics
of the Sun. Information will be obtained that will provide new understanding of nuclear physics and the prediction
of solar activity such as solar flares which direct terrestrial effects. The data will also be used in classwork. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

October 26, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94129. 

Applicant: 

University of Nebraska, Center for Materials Research  Analysis, Room 12C Walter Scott Engineer Center, Lincoln,
NE 68588. 

Instrument: 

Scanning Electron Microscope, Model JEM2010. 

Manufacturer: 

JEOL Ltd., Japan. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for the studies of many solid state materials, including metals, ceramics, semiconductors
and novel materials, and in particular magneto-optical multilayers, rare earth permanent magnets, thin metallic
films and catalyst particles. Experiments will include characterization of defects of crystal structures, of interfaces
and of other regions of varying chemical composition and atomic arrangement associated with different methods of
preparing and processing the materials. In addition, the instrument will be used for educational purposes in electron
microscopy courses. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

October 26, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94033R. 

Applicant: 

Simpson College, 701 North C Street, Indianola, IA 50125. 

Instrument: 

Rapid Kinetics Accessory, Model SFA-12. 

Manufacturer: 

Hi-Tech Scientific, United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

Original notice of this resubmitted application was published in the FEDERAL REGISTER of April 6, 1994.
