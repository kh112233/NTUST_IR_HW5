FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sandoz sees income rise of 10%
Sandoz, the Basle-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, said its
consolidated sales last year grew 5 per cent to SFr15.1bn (Dollars 10.3bn),
and it expected to report a 'marked increase' in net income of more than 10
per cent over 1992's SFr1.49bn.
Weak trends in industrial chemicals were more than offset by the continuing
strength of pharmaceutical sales.
Fourth-quarter sales of the pharmaceutical division, which accounts for
nearly half of total group sales, were up a brisk 10 per cent to SFr1.9bn.
Sales of Sandimmun, used to combat rejection of transplanted organs, were up
15 per cent, while those of Clozaril, a drug used for schizophrenia, soared
60 per cent.
In the full year, pharmaceutical sales were up 7 per cent to SFr7.35bn.
Chemical sales were flat in the fourth quarter at SFr585m, but up 2 per cent
in the full year to SFr2.5bn. Sandoz said the performance was above the
industry average due in part to increases in textile dyestuffs sales in the
US, Brazil and parts of Asia.
Agro-chemical sales dropped 7 per cent in the fourth quarter to SFr240m
because of a delayed start to the 1993-1994 season, but were up 7 per cent
in the full year to SFr1.3bn, thanks to new environmentally friendly
herbicides and fungicides.
Sales of the construction and environment division jumped 12 per cent to
SFr1.2bn in the full year, with above average results in the US and the Far
East.
