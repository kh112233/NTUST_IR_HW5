VOTERS OK OF TERM LIMITS 
Once again, an elected official displays disdain and arrogance for the people 
he governs. State Sen. Robert Presley ("Taking California Back to Amateur 
Status," Commentary, Nov. 8) believes that only self-serving, "experienced" 
professional politicians can serve their constituencies well because they are 
more competent and experienced and obviously understand the issues much better 
than the people whose lives are affected by their legislation. 
Personally, I feel that the electorate should have the widest latitude in 
electing individuals who will serve them honestly and that we already have the 
ability to vote out, recall or impeach those who compromise the public trust. 
And yet I cannot support the paternalistic argument that insiders know what is 
best for us. The current state of affairs -- locally, regionally and nationally 
-- shows this argument is false. 
If experience equalled good leadership, we would not see the great schism 
between the haves and have-nots, fiscal irresponsibility at all levels of 
government, diminished strength in several sectors in our economy and an 
alienated electorate that feels its voice stifled in the cacophony of 
special-interest groups. 
Those who serve the public well are those individuals who are true leaders -- 
those who have a commitment to act in the best interests of the community, 
those who have fresh ideas and common sense and will tackle problems in 
innovative ways and those who consider issues dispassionately and thoughtfully. 
Experience has its place, but by no means should it be the deciding factor.
