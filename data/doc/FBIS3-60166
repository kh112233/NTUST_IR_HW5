  [Text] Quito, 23 Jan (AFP) -- Ecuadoran Police announced on 
Sunday that they seized a large quantity of cocaine 
hydrochlorate, with an estimated value of more than $2 million, 
which Colombian drug trafficking groups were trying to transship 
through Ecuador. 
  In the first case, the drug had been cleverly camouflaged 
inside 100 meters of electrical cable which Colombian Cesar 
Augusto Andrade Gomez was trying to export to Rome. According 
to a police spokesman, Aldo J. Come, whose nationality has not 
been established, was to receive the package in Rome. Andrade 
was arrested at a post office branch in Quito where an Interpol 
agent inspected the package and discovered that the cocaine had 
been cleverly wrapped with protective plastic inside the cable. 
  Police also reported the arrest of a Colombian couple, 
Libardo Santander Benavides and his wife Berta Vargas Reina, who 
were keeping several packages of cocaine hydrochlorate in their 
home in Yaruqui, approximately 20 km northeast of Quito. The 
drug was brought into the country through Putumayo on the 
Colombian-Ecuadoran border. 
  Recently, the authorities also seized more than half a ton 
of 
cocaine in Guayaquil hidden in several Colombian products such 
as coffee, cookies, and candies, that were to be sent in a ship 
to the United States and Canada. 
  Police sources indicated that operations continue to 
dismantle what seems to be an international drug trafficking 
organization that is using Ecuador as a "bridge" as a result of 
the persecution against the Colombian cartels.
