REAL ESTATE AGENT SENTENCED ON TAX CHARGE 
A Woodland Hills real estate agent was sentenced Monday to five years probation 
and 300 hours of community service for understating his 1984 and 1985 real 
estate commissions by more than $84,000, the Internal Revenue Service reported. 
U. S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp also ordered Martin Parker Williams II to 
pay all back taxes, including penalties, interest and the costs of prosecution. 
A jury convicted Williams in October of signing false federal income tax 
returns for 1984 and 1985. 
Williams is the owner and president of White House Properties in Woodland 
Hills. The case grew out of an investigation by the IRS and the U. S. 
Attorney's office, IRS spokeswoman Jan Gribbon said.
