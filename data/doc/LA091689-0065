FAA ACCUSED OF ALTERING '81 CONTROLLER DATA 
A House panel charged Friday that FAA officials lied under oath about payroll 
records prepared during the 1981 controllers' strike and in some instances 
doctored time sheets to cheat the controllers. 
The committee asked the Justice Department to investigate. 
Faced with shoddy documents to justify the firings before the Merit Systems 
Protection Board, Federal Aviation Administration officials in Chicago for 
three months created attendance records to bolster their cases, lawmakers 
concluded. 
The report by the Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on 
investigations and oversight capped a three-year investigation that included 
private hearings and documents subpoenaed from the Chicago Air Route Traffic 
Control Center at Aurora, Ill. 
John Leyden, a spokesman for the FAA, refused to comment, except to say: "The 
FAA has received the report and will review it." 
The subcommittee said it was not judging the merits of the 450 firings in 
Chicago, which were among 11,500 nationwide ordered on Aug. 5, 1981, by 
then-President Ronald Reagan two days after members of the Professional Air 
Traffic Controllers Organization struck. 
Rather, the subcommittee said, it was concerned with the actions of FAA 
officials while they were defending the firings in front of the board that 
considers appeals from dismissed federal employees. 
For example, FAA officials corrected some attendance records to bring them up 
to date, but altered others, in some instances recording a controller who was 
on leave at the time of the strike as being absent without leave, to cheat the 
controllers, the subcommittee said.
