THE WORLD 
The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq resumed direct peace talks, but they 
appeared no closer to a permanent truce than when negotiations began eight 
months ago. Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz, leaving after 2 1/2 hours of 
talks in Geneva with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, said the 
meeting brought only a reiteration of clashing positions. Progress continues to 
be stalled over Iran's demand for a full withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Iran 
and Iraq's insistence on early dredging of the Shatt al Arab waterway, its only 
outlet to the sea. The talks were chaired by U.N. Secretary General Javier 
Perez de Cuellar. Another session is planned for today.
