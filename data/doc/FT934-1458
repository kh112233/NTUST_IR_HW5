FT  18 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei adds 1.5% in
record-setting region
Hopes for an imminent announcement of economic measures by the government
boosted sentiment, and the Nikkei average closed above the 18,000 level for
the first time since November 18, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei index rose 262.63, or 1.5 per cent, to 18,051.91, gaining ground
for the third consecutive day and up 3.9 per cent on the week. The Topix
index of all first section stocks gained 16.26, or 1.1 per cent, to
1,490.47.
Trading remained subdued for much of the day, but surged towards the end of
the session. The index fell to a low of 17,724.07 during the first hour of
trading but surged to 18,052.21 just before the close.
Volume totalled 287m shares against 339m as advances led losses by 682 to
326, with 167 unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed at
1,228.05, down 0.4.
Share prices overcame profit taking in the morning thanks to buying by
financial institutions.
The afternoon buying was triggered by investment trusts, which have set up
new funds linked to the new 300 issue Nikkei index.
Speculation that the government would cancel its planned flotation of Japan
Tobacco shares this fiscal year boosted Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Y28,000 to Y789,000 and East Japan Railway by Y17,000 to Y455,000. After the
market closed, the ministry of finance announced its decision to postpone
the JT listing.
Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, fell Y14 to Y699. Reports that
the company would be punished by the government, for its illegal exports to
the former East Germany during 1986 and 1987, prompted heavy selling.
However, other high-technology issues continued to gain ground. Sony rose
Y10 to Y5,510 and Matsushita Electric Industrial added Y10 to Y1,530.
Investors took profits on steel companies. Nippon Steel fell Y6 to Y305.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 95.40 to 19,761.60 in volume of 57.1m shares.
