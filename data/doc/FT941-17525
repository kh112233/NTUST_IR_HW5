FT  04 JAN 94 / Teachers challenge curriculum reform
More than three-fifths of members questioned by the NASUWT teaching union
said the National Curriculum had failed to improve the standard of
education.
However, the survey of more than 4,000 members of the union, the second
biggest teachers' union, found 60 per cent were in favour of a small core of
compulsory subjects with the remainder determined by schools.
Some 53 per cent were in favour of the principle of a national curriculum,
while 65 per cent said the existing one did not extend pupils' abilities,
and 61 per cent thought it had failed to improve the standard of education
in their school.
Nearly three-quarters said their job had become a lot more stressful, with
the main source of dissatisfaction being the extra workload created by
testing, assessment and the general increase in administration the
curriculum has caused.
Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary, said the union 'wants the National
Curriculum to succeed, having supported the principle of a core curriculum
for over 20 years'.
