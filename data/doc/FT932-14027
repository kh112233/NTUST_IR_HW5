FT  21 APR 93 / Guildford Four police face court
THREE POLICE officers 'manufactured and put forward false evidence' against
Mr Patrick Armstrong, one of the Guildford Four, an Old Bailey jury was told
yesterday.
The Guildford Four were released from 15 years' imprisonment in 1989 for the
Guildford pub bombings after the Court of Appeal overturned their
convictions.
Mr Julian Bevan QC, prosecuting, said former Detective Chief Inspector
Thomas Style, 59, former Detective Sergeant John Donaldson, 57, and former
Detective Constable Vernon Attwell, 52, were principally involved with
interviewing Mr Armstrong. 'The Crown's case is that these three
manufactured and put forward notes of interviews at the trial of Armstrong,
which they falsely asserted were contemporaneous notes of interviews.'
The officers deny conspiring together to pervert the course of justice.
