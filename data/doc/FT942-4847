FT  08 JUN 94 / Argentine trade gap widens
Argentina's trade deficit widened sharply in the first four months of the
year, further raising concern about the country's export competitiveness and
the sustainability of its fixed exchange rate, write John Barham and Stephen
Fidler in Buenos Aires.
Latest figures show the deficit grew nearly five-fold to Dollars 2.4bn
(Pounds 1.59bn) from Dollars 500m in the same period last year. But analysts
expect a deficit of about Dollars 7bn for the year, roughly double last
year's trade gap. Argentina has run a trade deficit nearly every month since
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, pegged the currency to the dollar in
April 1991.
But he denied the trade figures were alarming because they showed on the one
hand a sharp increase in exports of manufactures and on the other a large
inflow of capital goods.
Investment was 28 per cent higher in the first quarter compared with a year
ago, while consumption grew only 4 per cent, Mr Cavallo added.
'For the first time ever, investments have resulted in productivity gains
allowing an increase in exports despite growing domestic demand.'
In the past, when the economy grew, as it is now, exports fell. Now, said Mr
Cavallo, 'exports of manufactures are showing an increase of 28 per cent,
achieved through a rise in productivity. I have no doubt Argentina will have
a greater ability to export owing to increases in productivity.'
