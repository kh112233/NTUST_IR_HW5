  [Text] Washington, April 26 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton today offered U.S. congratulations to the people of 
South Africa and pledged to cooperate with the new government 
when the elections are over. 
  Clinton made the remarks before meeting a group of 
congressmen who visited South Africa a couple of weeks ago. 
  "To have this multi-racial election is really a wonderful 
thing," Clinton said. "The United States is committed to this 
process and its success, and we'll be there as a partner when 
the elections are over." 
  On Monday [25 April], Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said 
Washington would double its economic aid to South Africa once 
the first multi-race government takes over. 
  In a speech sponsored by the Howard University Committee on 
South Africa, Brown said Washington will pledge about 160 
million dollars to the nation after this week's historic 
elections. 
  The U.S. will also encourage its companies to invest in 
South 
Africa, Brown said. 
  At present, the U.S. Agency for International Development 
provides 80 million dollars in educational and humanitarian aid 
to non-governmental organizations in South Africa. 
  Officials said the new assistance will cover such 
traditional 
aid programs as housing, health and other social needs.
