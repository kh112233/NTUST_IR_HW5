FT  12 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin price breaks Dollars 6,000
barrier
TIN'S PRICE surged to the highest level for 18 months and broke decisively
through the Dollars 6,000 a tonne barrier on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday in a delayed reaction to news last Friday that Brazil, the world's
biggest producer, was to cut output in the hope that this would boost
prices.
Analysts and traders suggested, however, that the price would meet
substantial resistance at Dollars 6,200 a tonne. 'This is not the start of a
major bull market for tin, perhaps we will get that at the end of this year
or next year,' said Mr Robin Bhar, analyst at Carr Kitcatt &amp; Aitken, part of
the Banque Indosuez Group.
He suggested the ingredients for tin's rise from recent low levels of about
Dollars 5,500 a tonne had been evident for some weeks. The market had been
short of good brands from Brazil and Malaysia so 'it looks as if the market
can hold on to these gains'. Mr Bhar pointed out that there was ample supply
of low and medium-grade tin concentrates (an intermediate material)
available but there was a shortage of high-quality concentrate which many
smelters needed.
Tin for immediate delivery closed at Dollars 6,045 a tonne on the LME last
night, up Dollars 67.50 from Friday's close. Three-month tin rose Dollars 60
to Dollars 6,042.50 a tonne.
Brazil's intentions were outlined by Mr Mauricio Pinto da Silva, mining
division export manager of Paranapanema, the state-owned Brazilian tin
group, biggest of its kind in the world. He told a Metal Bulletin conference
in Phuket, Thailand: 'We want to see lower production to help realise our
aims of getting more remunerative but stable prices.'
Paranapanema's chief executive, Mr Samuel Hanan, said that Brazil's tin
production might fall to 25,000 tonnes in 1992 compared with 29,500 last
year and its peak in 1989 of 50,200 tonnes.
The conference also heard that Bolivia's output would fall to between 13,000
and 15,000 tonnes a year from 16,700 in 1991 while Malaysian production was
likely to slip below 20,000 tonnes from 20,710 last year. However,
Portugal's output is set to rise from 8,500 to 10,000 tonnes.
Carr Kitcatt's Mr Bhar suggested yesterday that demand for tin - the metal
is mainly used in tin plate, solder and chemicals - was probably stagnating
at best and prices would depend on suppliers' willingness to continue output
cuts. Demand for tin this year was likely to remain at the 1991 level of
180,000 tonnes while supply might fall by 5,000 to 10,000 tonnes to 155,000
to 160,000 tonnes.
He said prices would be held back by the large stockpile overhanging the
market - down from about 44,000 tonnes to 38,000 tonnes since the begining
of this year - and the fact that the US authorities would sell 12,000 tonnes
from their stocks this fiscal year.
The zinc market was more or less in balance in the first quarter of 1992 but
there was a substantial surplus of lead, according to the International Lead
and Zinc Study Group.
It said refined lead production was 1.4 per cent up on the same months of
1991 at 1.121m tonnes while consumption rose by only 0.6 per cent to 1.097m
tonnes. Refined zinc production was up 4.4 per cent to 1.357m tonnes and
consumption rose 2.9 per cent to 1.358m tonnes.
