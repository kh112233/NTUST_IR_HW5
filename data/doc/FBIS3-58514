  [Text] Paris, Jan 14 (AFP) -- France and Germany are 
considering using converted Tupolev 154's as spy planes to watch 
over foreign military bases in terms of the 1992 Conventional 
Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, the French Defence Ministry 
magazine INFO-DGA reported on Friday [14 January]. 
  The formerly Soviet planes, recovered by Germany, would be 
used for economy reasons, INFO-DGA, magazine of the General 
Armaments Delegation said. 
  The 22 CFE signatory countries also agreed to "open skies" 
overflights from this year of bases up to now considered secret. 
  A first experimental spy flight by a converted Tupolev took 
place over French bases at the end of last year, INFO-DGA said. 
  Britain was also involved in the experiment in which flight 
procedures and photographic equipment were tested. The aim was 
also to teach personnel on the ground how to conceal equipment 
they wish to keep secret, the magazine said. 
  The Tupolevs will reinforce ground and satellite inspections 
already taking place under CFE. 
  At the end of this year, France, Italy and Spain will launch 
the Helios military observation satellite, a key element in 
disarmament inspection, INFO-DGA said.
