  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Representatives of the banned Workers 
Party of Kurdistan [PKK] associations have put the blame for the 
latest riots and street blockades on the government. Bremen 
lawyer Eberhard Schultz stated to journalists in Bonn on 
Thursday [24 March] that without German arms deliveries to 
Turkey, which have been carried out for many years, the ban of 
the PKK, and the prevention of the Kurdish New Year 
celebrations, there would have been no violent clashes and 
nobody would have been killed or injured. "German policemen are 
always used against the Kurds on behalf of the Turkish military 
regime," Schultz said. 
  The representatives for the Kurds called on the FRG 
Government to rescind the PKK ban. Moreover, it is to refrain 
from deporting Kurdish demonstrators as planned because they are 
threatened by capital punishment in Turkey. Instead, Bonn is to 
advocate a peaceful, political solution of the conflict, it was 
stated.
