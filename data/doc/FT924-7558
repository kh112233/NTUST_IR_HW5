FT  16 NOV 92 / Cracks behind the unity: Efforts to curb the influx of
foreigners seeking asylum in Germany have split the country in two
Irena K is fed up with foreigners in Germany. 'They are letting in too many
people from Poland, Russia and Romania. Nobody works hard any more.
Something has changed in Germany since unification.' As she whiles away the
late morning in a cafe in Poll, a comfortable middle-class suburb of
Cologne, she starts to complain about the gypsy refugees from eastern
Europe. There are more than 150 who have lived for the past four years in
temporary housing a mile away. 'They are ruining the country,' she says.
The irony is that Irena speaks with a heavy Polish accent. She came to
Germany only two years ago from Katowice in southern Poland. As an
Aussiedler, an ethnic German living outside the federal republic, she has
the automatic right to live in Germany.
Her views capture something of the confused debate arising from the social
and economic impact of German unification, and the current uncertainty about
how to cope with an influx of tens of thousands of foreigners seeking asylum
every month.
Unlike in other European Community states, no one can emigrate to Germany,
because it has no immigration law. Yet anyone can enter the country because
of Germany's liberal asylum law.
Asylum is once again the most controversial issue on the political agenda in
Germany. It has deeply divided the country. The opposition Social Democratic
party (SPD) today opens an emergency congress to debate the topic, which has
revived unwanted memories of Germany's ignominious history and fears of a
revival of the extreme right.
The SPD's national, Lander (provincial) and city leadership, under pressure
in the regions from the extreme right-wing, recognises that some controls
must be imposed on the influx of foreigners. But the traditional left, and
those SPD members not in power in the Lander, wish to preserve the right to
asylum at all costs, precisely because of the political persecution by the
Nazis. Mr Bjorn Engholm, the party leader, has put his position on the line
by favouring the introduction of curbs aimed at preventing people from
abusing the country's liberal asylum law.
The SPD's position is crucial to any amendment to the right to asylum, which
is guaranteed under Article 16 of the German constitution. Any change, such
as that proposed by the ruling conservative coalition of Christian Democrats
(CDU), Christian Social Union (CSU) and Free Democrats (FDP), needs the
support of the SPD to have a two-thirds majority in parliament.
Yet many believe that any outcome from the debate about amending Article 16,
which states unambiguously that 'persons persecuted on political grounds
shall enjoy the right of asylum', will be futile unless all political
parties recognise the need for an immigration policy.
No matter what amendments are made, these will still deal with the issue of
refugees instead of the whole question of allowing people to emigrate to
Germany. As it stands, the 6m foreigners living in Germany have few
political rights: because there is no immigration policy, access to
citizenship is restricted.
'The SPD, like the other political parties, will have to face the fact that
Germany needs an immigration law,' says Ms Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, an FDP
parliamentary deputy and head of the government-backed Department for
Problems of Foreigners. 'There is no point in amending the constitution if
we are not prepared to introduce a policy on immigration,' she adds.
The current asylum debate has arisen for two reasons: the growing numbers of
people seeking asylum in Germany, and the rise of the far right.
More than 193,000 people arrived in Germany in 1990 (see chart), all
invoking Article 16. The number rose to more than 256,000 in 1991, and is
likely to reach 500,000 this year. Within the European Community, more than
60 per cent of all asylum applications last were year lodged in Germany.
The numbers have swollen, not only because of the war in the former
Yugoslavia, but also because unification has given Germany a 1,300km open
border to the east, straddling Poland and Czechoslovakia. Much of it is
impossible to police: in stretches, the Oder-Neisse river is only six inches
deep. Those who cross the border can claim asylum and remain in Germany
until their cases have been heard. The cumbersome administrative and appeal
system means that many cases take up to four years, although the average
time has been reduced to about 11 months. The current backlog exceeds
418,000.
During their stay in Germany, asylum seekers are provided with housing and
social welfare benefits, which the right believes are being exploited by
those abusing the asylum law. Bavaria's right-wing CSU, the junior partner
in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition, is campaigning for an end to the
appeal process, the scrapping of the asylum right in Article 16, and an
immigration law.
The CSU, which is worried that the neo-Nazi Republikaner party is eroding
its political base, claims that the refugees are exacerbating the housing
shortage. There is a shortfall of between 1.5m and 2m apartments in west
Germany's urban areas. However, there are few signs of refugees jumping the
housing list at one small refugee camp in the middle of an industrial estate
near Cologne. The 200 asylum seekers, who include 150 gypsies from the
former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, live in cramped, one-room,
barrack-type housing.
The right-wing also criticises the cost of caring for the asylum seekers.
Last year, the German government earmarked DM6.4bn (Pounds 2.6bn), of which
DM5.4bn was spent on accommodation and social assistance, bringing the
annual cost for each asylum seeker to DM15,000. Criticism about the cost of
supporting the refugees has sharpened with rising unemployment, curbs on
public spending and increased financial aid to eastern Germany.
The reaction of eastern Germans to refugees has also hardened debate. More
than 20 per cent of asylum seekers have been assigned to the five new
federal Lander in the east. 'It has been an awful experience,' says Ms
Schmalz-Jacobsen, who spends her time monitoring the problems faced by
foreigners. 'The living conditions for refugees in eastern Germany are
appalling. The hatred between the eastern Germans and the foreigners is
terrible.'
Mr Stephan Eisel, a specialist in asylum issues at the conservative Konrad
Adenauer Stiftung think-tank in Bonn, says east Germans are not accustomed
to foreigners. 'In the former German Democratic Republic, the Cubans,
Angolans and the Vietnamese lived in ghettoes. There was no attempt at
integration. Foreigners were viewed with suspicion,' he says.
He and Ms Schmalz-Jacobsen believe that foreigners have become easy
scapegoats because eastern Germans did not go through a period of
de-Nazification, and are now facing massive social change caused by the
collapse of communism.
But neither blames the easterners alone for the rise in xenophobia,
anti-semitism and right-wing extremism. In the first seven months of 1992,
the Interior Ministry registered 1,443 criminal acts against foreigners.
Most were committed in the rich western states of Baden-Wurttemberg, Hesse
and North Rhine-Westphalia.
'I receive many letters from westerners who praise the eastern Ger mans'
hostile attitude to foreigners. They say they want Article 16 to be scrapped
and foreigners to be expelled,' says Ms Schmalz-Jacobsen. 'In this context,
I can understand why the SPD is torn over Article 16.
'Article 16 was born out of our Nazi past. It was enshrined in the
constitution to show that Germany was an open country for the persecuted.'
The leaderships of the four main political parties are close to a compromise
on amending Article 16. The CDU, FDP and SPD want asylum qualified in the
constitution by including the 1951 United Nations Geneva Convention on the
Status of Refugees. This defines a refugee as any person with a well-founded
fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality,
membership of a particular social group or political opinion. 'Economic
refugees' who use Article 16 to enter the country would find it more
difficult to claim asylum under the Geneva convention.
Furthermore, all the parties want the procedure for unfounded cases to be
speeded up, and the right to asylum protected against abuse. 'Criminal
organisations in eastern Europe are exploiting our laws,' says Ms Herta
Daubler-Gmelin, a deputy parliamentary leader of the SPD. 'The SPD wants the
constitution to define who is a political refugee. That is why including the
Geneva convention is important,' she adds.
As a means of curbing illegal immigration - the Interior Ministry estimates
that more than 150,000 people have illegal status - Germany has signed
agreements with Romania and Bulgaria, allowing repatriation. Some 7,000
would-be asylum seekers were repatriated 'voluntarily' last year.
As for the Aussiedler, who number about 2m in eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union, they are being discouraged from travelling directly to Germany
by first having to apply through the German consulates in their country of
origin. As a result, the number of such admissions to Germany decreased from
397,000 in 1990 to 222,000 in 1991.
Despite the proposed amendments, few officials from the main political
parties believe they will have any significant impact unless they are
followed by an immigration law.
The overall immigration pressure is potentially enormous. There is a backlog
of 700,000 Aussiedler applications, and a fear that continuing instability
in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union will unleash a wave of new asylum
seekers to Germany.
Legal experts believe that all the political parties, including the SPD,
will eventually adopt an immigration law, partly to conform with EC
standards, and partly to cope with immigration from the east. But Ms
Daubler-Gmelin sounds a note of warning. 'We should not amend Article 16,
let alone introduce an immigration law, if it means pandering to the far
right.
'We should do it because we believe we need it, and it is beneficial for our
democracy. On that basis the SPD might obtain a consensus.'
