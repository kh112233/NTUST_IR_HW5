<F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Who </F>
Calls the Shots at Ostankino?"] 
  [Text] To all appearances, Aleksandr Yakovlev, current 
chief of the federal television service, has virtually no role 
to play there; the shots in the television empire are called by 
his first deputy, Valentin Lazutkin, who has been orienting 
himself toward Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. 
  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned from an informed source 
that things have gone so far that the list of news items for the 
21:00 "Novosti" news program is sent during the day to 
Government Press Service chief Sergeyev for approval. A report 
on Yegor Gaydar's recent press conference is a case in point: 
His quips about Chernomyrdin and "laboratory chiefs" liberally 
quoted by the mass media have disappeared without a trace, and 
Yegor Timurovich himself was portrayed as an apologizing retiree.
