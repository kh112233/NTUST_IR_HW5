  [Text] Santiago, 5 May (EFE) -- Chilean Senate President 
Gabriel Valdes will head the official Chilean delegation 
attending next week's inauguration of the leader of the African 
National Congress (ANC) in South Africa, Valdes himself reported 
today. The Christian Democratic Senator said he is very 
satisfied to represent Chile "at an historic event." 
  Valdes stressed the value of democracy, "which has given the 
black South African majority what they could not attain during 
so many decades of bloody fights," and also underlined the 
peaceful elections held last week. 
  The South African people have demonstrated "great devotion 
and respect in expressing their position through elections," the 
Chilean politician said, after which he spoke about the 
personalities of Nelson Mandela and outgoing President Frederik 
de Klerk. 
  Mandela "is the hero of this historic moment," and De Klerk 
"managed to make the whites accept the voice and the vote of the 
majority" of the people, Valdes said. He added that the two 
have demonstrated that they truly deserved the Nobel Peace Prize 
they were awarded last year.
