  [Text] Javornik, south Moravia Jan 19 (CTK) -- The 
situation is tense and dangerous in the village of U Sabotu 
after the interior ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia 
announced that they would recommend their governments to 
transfer 140 hectares of Czech territory and 37 houses to 
Slovakia, some local people told CTK today. A total of 126 
people live in the village. Some of them have sent two 
petitions asking the governments to allow the village to join 
Slovakia. "The first blow was dealt to a Slovak who accepted 
Czech citizenship, which the other side did not like. A smashed 
window and a destroyed new railway waiting room in Javornik are 
also nothing usual here," the mayor of the village said. 
  Representatives of the local Civic Democratic Party (ODS) 
from the neighboring village of Velka nad Velickou handed over a 
protest against the transfer of the Czech territory. "It cannot 
be determined by the petitions how many Slovaks really want to 
join Slovakia. Some signatures can be questioned. We have 
owned some properties there since 19th century," an ODS official 
said.
