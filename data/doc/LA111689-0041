AGENT ORANGE CASH AWARDS ACCELERATED 
A lump-sum payment of as much as $8,900 will be sent before Christmas to 9,300 
Vietnam War veterans disabled by Agent Orange, according to an order signed in 
New York by a federal judge. The payments, totaling about $30 million, won't 
significantly change the total award an eligible veteran will receive but 
provide a large share of the compensation in a single payment, court officials 
said. In 1984, seven chemical companies -- without admitting guilt -- agreed to 
pay $180 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by Vietnam veterans 
and their families.
