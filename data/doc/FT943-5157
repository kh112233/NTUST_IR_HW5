FT  06 SEP 94 / Five Swiss charged over Iraqi 'supergun'
Five Swiss businessmen have been charged with knowingly supplying components
to Iraq for the so-called supergun in contravention of the Swiss weapons
export control law.
The supergun, which was apparently designed to fire a tonne of anthrax on
Israel, has already become a cause celebre in the UK. A trial of British
businessmen for supplying components for the supergun and other Iraqi
military projects collapsed spectacularly in November, 1992 when it emerged
that ministers had approved the activity and suppressed evidence.
The Swiss charged are four employees of Von Roll, a large metals group, and
a director of the trading company, Uldry. A federal prosecutor has submitted
the case to the federal court in Lausanne, which now has to decide whether
or not to proceed with it.
Von Roll said in a statement yesterday that it stood fully behind its
employees. The company said it had received a number of orders between 1988
and 1990 from the Iraqi Ministry of Industry.
They involved the supply of various machine parts, including cylinders,
which according to the client's declaration were intended for forging
presses.
'Apparently, the Iraqi client intended to use the components for the
construction of a so-called supergun, a cannon whose size and weight was
several times greater than any ever seen. Whereas the greatest barrel length
seen in the last 20 years was 37 metres with a calibre of 150 millimetres,
the supergun had a barrel length of 157 metres and a calibre of 1,000mm.
'That the machine parts could be used for a weapon had already been ruled
out because of their size. Our employees could not have foreseen the
possibility of these parts having a military use,' it said.
