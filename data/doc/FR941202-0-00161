 

Executive Orders 12866, 12612, and 12630 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act 



This final rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. This action
would not be expected to have significant taking implications for U.S. citizens, as per Executive Order 12630. Any
effects on small entities (importers, shippers, etc.) would likely be minor, and would in any event be the mandatory
result of the district court ruling. Future final rulemaking will establish procedures for listing of species approved
for import, which may reduce any effects on small entities. No reporting requirements would be added to existing regulations.
Therefore, this revision would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities as
described by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Since this final rule applies to importation of live exotic birds into
the United States, it does not contain any Federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. The Department
has certified that this rule meets the applicable standards provided in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order
12778. 



Paperwork Reduction Act 



No new information collection requirement(s) are contained in this final rule for which OMB approval under 44 U.S.C.
3501 is necessary.
