FT  29 JAN 94 / Legal battle over Aids drug widens
Lawyers acting for the widow of a British Aids victim said yesterday they
had widened the legal battle over the claimed toxic effects of AZT, the most
widely prescribed anti-Aids drug.
They are extending their case against Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company,
to include a US government agency.
Mrs Susan Threakall claims her haemophiliac husband's death was caused by
the drug AZT and not by Aids, solicitor Mr Graham Ross said. She says her
husband was given AZT only because of unjustified claims made for the drug
by Wellcome and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases.
Her case against Wellcome was announced earlier this month. The company said
it would defend the case vigorously.
