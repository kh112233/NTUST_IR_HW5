SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is announcing a forthcoming meeting of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee on pediatric dosing (use
by children under 12 years of age) of OTC drug products. FDA is holding this meeting to discuss topics such as: 


(1) What is the most preferred and practical basis for determining and labeling OTC systemic pediatric dosages, e.g.,
age, weight, height (length), body surface area, or a combination of these? 
(2) Is the dosing approach (adult1 full dose, children 6 to 121/2 adult dose, and children 2 to 6
1/4 adult dose) currently being used for most OTC oral drugs an adequate method of dosing? 
(3) Should there be differences in systemic pediatric dosing ranges for specific ingredients or different classes
of OTC drug products? If yes, for which specific ingredients or classes of products? 
(4) Should calibrated dosage devices be required for (specific or all) pediatric products? If yes, for which product(s)
and how should they be calibrated (e.g., devices expressing dosage levels in teaspoon or milliliter units)? 
(5) What are the lowest limits (e.g., age, weight, etc.) for which specific dosing instructions should appear in OTC
product labeling? Would these limits be different for certain classes of OTC drugs, such as internal analgesics,
antihistamines, etc.? 
The purpose of this meeting is to address specific topics and questions contained in the summary information document
that could result in future rulemaking. FDA has established public docket no. 88N0004 to enable interested
persons to submit comments or other relevant data on the summary information document.
