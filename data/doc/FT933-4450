FT  09 SEP 93 / GM attacks 'lip service' over probe
Volkswagen should start to co-operate fully with the investigation by public
prosecutors of the alleged theft of secret documents from General Motors and
not just 'pay lip service' to co-operation, Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM
Europe, said at the Frankfurt motor show.
In the event of charges being laid, it would be 'a case of industrial
espionage of unbelievable proportions,' said Mr Hughes. 'An industrial
version of Watergate.' VW said it was already co-operating fully with the
state prosecutor and called Mr Hughes' remarks 'unjust'.
