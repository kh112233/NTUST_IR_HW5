Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial report] Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese, in its 7 February issue, publishes a 400-word 
article by Andre Lozano about Europeans coming to buy cocaine in 
Leticia, Colombia, on the border with Brazil, and in Tabatinga, 
in Amazonas State. 
  According to the Amazon Federal Police, the article states, 
the arrest during the past three months of four Europeans 
carrying cocaine at the Manaus International Airport "shows that 
foreign traffickers are purchasing drugs from the Leticia 
Cartel" because, "traffickers are being greatly persecuted on 
the Solimoes River" by the Floating Police Station. 
  The article describes the arrest, on different occasions, of 
Reinhard Gerush, 36, German, with 5.9 kg of cocaine; Fabrizio 
Orlandini, Italian, and Joaquim Mendoza, Spanish, with 6.8 kg of 
cocaine; and Josep Maria Boada, with 4 kg of cocaine. 
  A 200-word insert on the same page states that the Amazon 
Federal Police confiscated 800 kg of cocaine during 1993 and 
that the Floating Federal Police Station confiscated 22.4 kg of 
cocaine in December alone.
