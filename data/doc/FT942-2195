FT  21 JUN 94 / Court to rule on candidate curbs
The US Supreme Court yesterday agreed to decide the constitutionality of
laws restricting the number of times members of Congress can run for
re-election.
In congressional elections over the past four years much has been made of
the public's anger with long-time incumbents, who are often perceived to be
out of touch with voters and the cause of corruption and political gridlock
in Washington.
However, incumbents are hard to defeat because they usually have political
and financial resources far exceeding their challengers.
The populist anti-incumbent movement has led to enactment of term-limit
amendments in 15 states.
At issue in the case the Supreme Court said it would hear is an amendment to
the Arkansas state constitution that prohibits senators who have served two
six-year terms and House members who have served three two-year terms from
appearing on the ballot.
An Arkansas court invalidated the law in March, citing a 1969 Supreme Court
decision that Congress cannot, except in the case of impeachment and
conviction, exclude any member meeting the constitutional qualifications -
minimum age, US citizenship and state residency.
