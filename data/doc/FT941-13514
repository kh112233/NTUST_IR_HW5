FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Combine in Quebec home link-up
A consortium of Canadian companies - including cable group Videotron and the
National Bank of Canada - yesterday announced plans to launch an
interactive, multi-media home communications system in Quebec, in
partnership with America's privately-owned Hearst Corporation.
The consortium is led by Le Groupe Videotron, one of Canada's leading cable
businesses, which has over 1m subscribers in Quebec and has been providing
first generation interactive services to subscribers in Montreal and
Britain.
The new system will offer consumers interactive services ranging from home
banking - including the ability to transfer money from an account to a debit
card - to home shopping and purchase of lottery tickets.
Hearst, which will have a 10 per cent stake in the venture, will provide
electronic business and yellow pages information directories, as well as
some shopping services. The project, costing CDollars 200m (USDollars 152m),
will deploy 34,000 home terminals in the Saguenay region of Quebec in 1995.
