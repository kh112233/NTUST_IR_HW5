FT  04 FEB 93 / Czechs, Slovaks in sell-off row
THE new Czech Republic is demanding Kcs19bn (Dollars 655m) from Slovakia to
compensate it for the loss that it claims arises from the sale of state
assets before Czechoslovakia split into two republics at the start of the
year.
It has threatened to seize Slovak assets if the money is not paid.
The row over assets privatised in the former Czechoslovakia is threatening
to cause further friction between the two new republics.
The Czech government says that the Slovaks must make up for the difference
in the value of privatised assets bought by Slovak investors in last year's
voucher privatisations.
The Czechs says Slovak investors took up a far greater proportion of equity
in Czech companies than Czech investors in Slovak ones, and that this
represents a massive financial handout to Slovakia. It wants the Slovak
government to pay Kcs19bn in compensation, but the Slovak authorities say
that they are willing to pay only about Kcs900m.
Mr Jiri Skalicky, Czech privatisation minister, says that unless an
acceptable compromise is reach in three weeks, Slovak assets will be seized.
He says the Czech government offered more property for privatisation than
the Slovak one, and that the privatised Czech companies have a higher real
value than their Slovak counterparts.
'In our agreement on dividing the (Czechoslovak) state last year it was also
agreed that privatisation should continue but that it should be balanced,'
he said.
