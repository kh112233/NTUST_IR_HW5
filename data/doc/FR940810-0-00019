<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of (1) a new antibiotic drug,
rifabutin, and (2) its use in a dosage form, rifabutin capsules. The agency has concluded that the data supplied by
the manufacturer concerning these antibiotic drugs are adequate to establish their safety and efficacy when used
as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR parts 430, 436, and 455 to include accepted
standards for these products.


Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 


Submitting Comments and Filing Objections


This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because when effective it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
September 9, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before September 9, 1994, submit written comments to the
Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals
may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.
Received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before September 9,
1994, a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before October 11, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

(2) 

Standard solution

. Prepare a solution of 

N

-isobutylpiperidone standard in 1:1 chloroform/methanol to contain 1 milligram per milliliter. Transfer aliquots
of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 milliliters into separate 100-milliliter volumetric flasks and dilute to volume with
1:1 chloroform/methanol. These solutions contain, respectively, the equivalent of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0
percent of 

N

-isobutylpiperidone.
(d) 

Procedure

. Pour 100 milliliters of developing solvent into the glass trough on the bottom of the unlined chromatography tank.
Cover and seal the tank. Allow it to equilibrate while the plate is being prepared. Prepare a plate as follows: on a line
2.0 centimeters from the base of the thin layer chromatography plate, and at intervals of 2.0 centimeters, apply 10
microliters of each of the standard solutions and the sample solution prepared as directed above. After the spots
are thoroughly dry, place the plate into the trough in the bottom of the tank. Cover and tightly seal the tank, allow
the solvent front to travel about 15 centimeters from the starting line and then remove the plate from the tank. Air
dry the plate. Warm the iodine vapor chamber to vaporize the iodine crystals and place the dry plate in the iodine vapor
chamber until the spots are visible (usually about 5 minutes). Remove the plate from the iodine vapor chamber and spray
with 1 percent starch solution.
(e) 

Evaluation
