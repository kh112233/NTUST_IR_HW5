FT  13 JUL 93 / Ruling reserved in RSI case
JUDGMENT was reserved yesterday in the High Court case of a former Reuters
journalist who is suing the news agency for compensation after developing
repetitive strain injury working on computer keyboards. The judge is
expected to announce his ruling in early September.
Mr Rafiq Mughal, whose action is backed by the NUJ journalists union, has
claimed Reuters failed to take heed of warnings issued by the Health and
Safety Executive and other bodies about the dangers of using new technology.
The action is seen by the NUJ as a test case with important implications for
a series of similar pending cases. These include a number being brought
against the Financial Times by some of its current and former journalists.
