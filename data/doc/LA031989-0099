THE WORLD; 
AIRPORT RULES TIGHTENED 
New security orders have been issued to all of Britain's major airports, a 
Manchester airport spokesman said. The orders came amid controversy over 
warnings received before the December bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. According 
to British media, the new directive requires passengers to remove all electric 
and electronic equipment from luggage before check-in and to pack such items in 
hand luggage for inspection at boarding gates. Investigators have said the bomb 
that blew up Flight 103 on Dec. 21 over Lockerbie, Scotland -- killing all 259 
people aboard and 11 on the ground -- had been concealed in a radio-cassette 
player.
