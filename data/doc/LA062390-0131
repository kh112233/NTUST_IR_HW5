ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; 
TRASH-RATE INCREASE TO PAY FOR RECYCLING 
Trash rates will be going up almost $2 a month starting July 1 to pay for a new 
recycling program. 
Monthly trash rates will increase from $7.23 to $9.18 one month before the 
recycling program starts Aug. 1. 
The program will initially require residents to separate garbage into 
containers provided by the city. 
Orange-colored bins will be used for glass and plastic containers, and 
newspapers are to be placed on top of these bins, said City Manager Lee Risner. 
Non-recyclables will be placed in another container. 
Trash collection is handled by Western Waste Industries, which will sell the 
recyclable materials and give the proceeds to the city. 
The city will soon begin separating its clippings of greenery and grass from 
regular trash. The materials will be compacted, but composting may be attempted 
in the future, Risner said. 
The city is required by state law to complete a study of local waste by the end 
of the year. 
Risner expects revenues from the sale of recycled materials to cover the cost 
of the required study. DAVID F. BURKE
