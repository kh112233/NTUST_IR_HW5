Definitions

Chewable surface

 means any intact protruding painted surface up to five feet from the floor or ground that is readily accessible to children
less than six years of age (e.g., protruding corners, windowsills and frames, doors and frames, and other protruding
woodwork). 


Defective paint surface

 means the same as the term is defined in 35.22 of this title. 


Elevated blood lead level or EBL

 means the same as the term is defined in 35.3 of this title. 


* * * * * 


(3)***Defective paint surfaces either must be tested for lead content or, if defective
paint surfaces are not tested, the presence of lead-based paint shall be assumed and the surfaces abated in accordance
with 35.24(b) of this title as a condition of satisfaction of the requirements of 886.107(c). 
(4)(i) 

Chewable surfaces

. In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, a random sample of dwelling units shall be tested
for lead-based paint on chewable surfaces in accordance with 200.820(c)(1) of this title. Testing shall be
performed using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of
1 mg/cm2 or higher using an XRF shall be considered positive. If the laboratory reports the results in percent by weight,
0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million shall be considered positive. Testing of chewable surfaces shall be performed
by a State or local health or housing agency, or by an organization recognized by HUD. The testing entity shall certify
to the results of the test. The owner shall be responsible for obtaining these testing services. Where lead-based
paint on chewable surfaces is identified, the entire interior or exterior chewable surface shall be treated. Covering
or removal of the paint surface in accordance with 35.24(b)(4) of this title shall be required as a condition
of satisfaction of the requirements of 886.107(c). 
(ii) 

EBL child

. In the case of a residential structure constructed before 1978, if the owner is presented with test results that indicate
a child less than six years of age living in a unit has an elevated blood lead level or EBL, the owner must either test the
unit occupied by the child and, if the test is positive for lead-based paint, abate the unit surfaces in accordance
with the methods set out in 35.24(b)(4), or choose not to test, but then abate all the unit surfaces. 
(iii) 

Abatement without testing

. In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraphs (i)(3) and (4) of this section, in the case of a residential structure
constructed before 1978, the owner may forego testing and abate all defective and chewable surfaces in accordance
with the methods set out in 35.24(b)(4) of this title.
