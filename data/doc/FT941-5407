FT  07 MAR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Egyptian fear
Extremists are continuing their campaign of violence, mainly in the area of
Assiut in Upper Egypt, but also in Cairo and occasionally elsewhere. In
February, they explicitly threatened to attack tourism, foreign investments
and banks. There have been several attacks on tourist targets. Over the past
two years, terrorist attacks have caused the deaths of seven foreigners.
The authorities are giving the highest priority to protecting visitors: more
than 250,000 Britons visited Egypt in 1993 without experiencing any security
difficulty. But complete security cannot be guaranteed and further incidents
are to be expected.
Visitors should not travel to or through the Assiut area. They should be
vigilant and are reminded to behave and dress discreetly.
