  [Text] Stuttgart (DPA) -- Three policemen were injured 
during a demonstration of Kurds in Stuttgart on Thursday evening 
[7 April]. Eight persons were arrested. According to 
information released by the police, the three policemen were 
kicked and beaten when they tried to confiscate fliers of a 
banned subgroup of the Workers Party of Kurdistan. The 
demonstration of about 150 people was aimed against the 
persecution of Kurds in Turkey. Speakers primarily opposed the 
intended deportation of Kurds by Bavaria.
