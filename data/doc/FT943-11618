FT  29 JUL 94 / Technology: Putting the brakes on skidding - Worth Watching
A system to help prevent cars from skidding has been developed by Bosch, the
German electronic and vehicle parts manufacturer.
Its Vehicle Dynamics Control system depends on sensors which measure the
rate at which the car is turning its vertical axis, together with the car's
lateral acceleration, steering angle, wheel speeds and braking pressure.
These sensors feed information to an electronic control unit which is able
to compare the requested steering angle with the actual course of the
vehicle. The system then corrects any error in the car's course by braking
the appropriate wheel.
The system is designed to be used in conjunction with anti-lock braking
systems, which intervene when a wheel is about to lock during braking and
traction control, which prevents the wheels from slipping during
acceleration.
