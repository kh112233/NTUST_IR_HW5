Iran released 70 disabled and sick Iraqi prisoners of war as a gesture of good 
will to mark the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Islamic republic, 
the official IRNA news agency reported. All but four of the POWs later arrived 
in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad aboard a jet chartered by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross. IRNA said the four who refused to board the plane 
were granted asylum in Iran. The Iranian news agency said that while Iran has 
released 1,346 disabled Iraqi prisoners in several stages since the Aug. 20 
cease-fire, Iraq has freed only 949 Iranian POWs.
