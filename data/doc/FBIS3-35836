  [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- The nuclear power 
engineering industry of Russia will get almost absolutely safe 
reactor for its nuclear power stations by 2004, this ultimate 
target has been approved by the state programme of the 
Government of Russia, for the implementation of which dozens of 
leading institutes and scientific centres of the Academy of 
Sciences, Ministry of Atomic Energy and Ministry of Science have 
joined forces. 
  The new reactor has been named as a hybrid one, since its 
system will be an amalgamation of the nuclear and thermonuclear 
subsystem, chief scientific research supervisor, academician and 
Nobel prize laureate Nikolay Basov told ITAR-TASS. According to 
the scientist, "only this union of ideas" can guarantee the 
complete safety of the nuclear installation. 
  The Russian project of nuclear power engineering of the XXI 
century has passed all-round expertise in scientific centres of 
Russia. Experts of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) have especially noted the original technology of the use 
of laser source of neutrons in the future reactor. 
  Foreign colleagues, according to academician Basov, have 
highly appreciated the degree of burning out of nuclear fuel and 
the possibility of using different kinds of nuclear fuels in the 
nuclear-thermonuclear reactor, including uranium of natural 
isotope composition. Thus a possibility of the efficient use of 
spent radioactive waste has been opened up, which is quite 
important for Russia in its conditions of the destruction of 
nuclear weapons.
