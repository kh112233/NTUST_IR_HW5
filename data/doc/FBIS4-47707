  [Text] Pretoria May 2 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk and 
senior National Party [NP] members were meeting on Monday [2 
May] to compile a shortlist of NP members to serve in the new 
cabinet. Cabinet members, the four NP provincial leaders and 
provincial premiership candidates were at the meeting, NP 
spokesman Danie du Plessis said. 
  The meeting will also discuss NP representation in 
provincial 
governments. 
  On Tuesday, Mr de Klerk will meet African National Congress 
President Nelson Mandela, who is almost certain to be sworn in 
as South Africa's first black state president. 
  Mr Mandela has said the composition of the cabinet in the 
Government of National Unity would be chosen at his discretion. 
  In terms of the constitution, however, Mr Mandela is obliged 
to include in his cabinet members of opposition parties that 
obtained more than five per cent of the national vote. 
  As the results stood on Monday, the NP with more than 30 per 
cent of the vote qualified for six cabinet posts and the Inkatha 
Freedom Party for one. 
  ANC spokesmen indicated at the weekend that even if parties 
did not obtain five per cent of the vote they could be 
represented in the cabinet in the interests of creating an as 
broadly representative cabinet as possible. They named Freedom 
Front [FF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen whose FF had almost four 
per cent of the vote as a possible candidate. 
  The constitution also stipulates that the second biggest 
party is entitled to nominate one of two executive deputy state 
presidents, one of whom is certain to be Mr de Klerk. 
  Other names mentioned as possible contenders for cabinet 
posts are Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer, 
Cape NP leader Dawie de Villiers, Minister of Justice and 
Defence Kobie Coetsee, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha and 
Minister of Finance Derek Keys. 
  Mr de Klerk's cabinet meets again on Wednesday, perhaps for 
the last time as the NP government.
