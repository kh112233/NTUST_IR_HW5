FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: QVC replies to takeover defeat
with shake-up
Mr Barry Diller, chairman of television shopping group QVC Network,
yesterday shrugged off his defeat on Monday in the Dollars 10bn takeover
battle for Paramount Communications, and announced a wide-ranging shake-up
of management structure and senior staff.
He named Mr Douglas Briggs, a direct marketing expert and a key player in
QVC's development as a cable-TV home shopping network, to the new position
of president, QVC electronic retailing.
Mr Briggs said since its launch seven years ago, QVC had operated primarily
as a single-channel television shopping service. It now planned to evolve
into a multi-line business which would 'fill the multimedia spectrum with
services'.
Mr Michael Boyd, president of QVC and a co-founder of the company, is
retiring. His position will not be filled. Mr Diller said Mr Boyd had wanted
to step down some time ago, but was persuaded to stay on while QVC pursued
Paramount.
The group, which is shortening its name to QVC Inc, said its new lifestyle
shopping channel, Q2, would begin operating on weekends in May. It was also
establishing a new division, QDirect, to produce direct response television
advertisements and 30-minute advertising programmes.
QDirect would explore joint ventures with other cable and broadcast
networks.
Fitch Investors Service, the credit rating agency, said yesterday Viacom's
success in the Paramount takeover continued to raise uncertainty over its
ability to retain its Triple-B-Minus senior debt rating.
Factors affecting the rating included the new entity's ability to generate
cashflow to reduce post-merger debt leverage within 12 months; its ability
to integrate the diverse operations; and uncertainly over Viacom's proposed
bid for Blockbuster Entertainment.
