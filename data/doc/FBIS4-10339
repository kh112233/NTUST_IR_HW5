  [Text] (NA) -- The fourth Argentine-British Conference 
opened here yesterday and sources said that the main topic of 
discussion centred on the rejection on the part of the Malvinas 
islands inhabitants to bring the issue of sovereignty under 
debate. 
  "As long as Argentina continues to claim sovereignty over 
the 
islands it is difficult that there will ever be normal relations 
between the two countries," a spokesman for the Kelpers at the 
conference said. 
  However progress was apparently made on the issues of 
commerce and culture between the islands and continental 
Argentina, sources said. 
  The Conference, which will go on until tomorrow, will 
continue to be staged behind closed doors.
