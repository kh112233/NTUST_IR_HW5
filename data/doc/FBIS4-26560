  [Text] Journalist Xi Yang has won an award far the reports 
which led to him being jailed by China for 12 years. 
  Xi and three colleagues at Ming Pao took the Newspaper 
Society of Hong Kong prize for the best business story in a 
Chinese publication. 
  Their entry was a series of reports on China's 
macro-economic 
control. After the articles appeared in June and July last 
year, Xi was arrested and accused of"spying on and stealing 
state secrets". 
  One of the adjudicators of the awards, To Yiu-ming, of the 
Hong Kong Baptist College Journalism Department, said Xi won the 
award for the outstanding reporting he did in the series. 
  "Xi and his colleagues have chosen a very hot topic of great 
impact to the Chinese economy. They managed to come up with 
several scoops while presenting a comprehensive picture of the 
financial situation in China." 
  He said the granting of the award had nothing to do with the 
Government's jailing of Xi. 
  "But it does reflect the irony that things that we honour in 
our society are regarded as a crime by Chinese authorities," he 
said. 
  Executive Chief Editor of Ming Pao, Paul Cheung Kin-por, 
said: "The award confirmed the hard work of Xi Yang and his 
colleagues. 
  "But we also feel sorry about what happened to Xi, after all 
he did what a reporter is supposed to do." 
  Mr Cheung said the paper would tell Xi's father, Xi 
Linsheng, 
about the award.
