  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 1 
March. 
  The Costa Rican Government has paid the $19 million it owed 
up to December 1993 on its debt with the Paris Club. Although 
Finance Minister Carlos Munoz admitted the existence of gaps in 
the payment of the foreign debt, he said the government has made 
an effort to put its foreign accounts in order, thanks to which 
it has been able to obtain loans for both the public and private 
sectors. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 15 Feb 94 p 14A) 
  The Exports and Investments Promotion Center, CENPRO, has 
disclosed that in January 1994 Costa Rica's exports increased by 
more than 2 percent over its exports during the same month in 
1993, going from $202 million in 1993 to $207 million in 1994. 
However, if income from tourism is excluded, exports for the 
month dropped below the levels recorded in 1993. CENPRO adds 
that tourism and nontraditional exports increased while 
traditional and manufactured goods exports decreased. In 
January 1994 the country collected $54 million from tourism and 
$152 million from traditional, nontraditional, and manufactured 
goods exports. (San Jose LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 16 Feb 94 p 
10C) 
  The National Banana Corporation [Corporacion Bananera 
Nacional], Corbana, has disclosed that Costa Rica's banana 
exports increased by 10.61 percent in 1993 despite the 
restrictions imposed by the European Union, EU, on Latin 
American bananas. In 1993 Costa Rica exported almost 101 
million 18 kg-boxes of bananas, approximately 10 million more 
than in 1992, and 46 percent of them were sent to European 
countries, which proves that the EU quota reduction did not 
affect Costa Rican trade. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1638 GMT 22 Feb
