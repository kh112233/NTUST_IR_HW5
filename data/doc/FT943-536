FT  29 SEP 94 / Safety rules that failed the Estonia: It was a modern ship,
well maintained and partly Swedish owned. But are even the best ro-ro
ferries vulnerable?
If regulation alone could prevent ferries sinking, then the Estonia would
never have gone down in the icy waters of the Baltic.
Shipping safety has engaged the attention of dozens of committees sitting
for thousands of hours in recent years and the conventions which roll out of
the London headquarters of the International Maritime Organisation are
constantly being revised and upgraded.
All this earnest activity has still not prevented heavily laden ferries
sinking in the coastal waters of the Philippines, Indonesia and Bangladesh
in recent years with enormous loss of life. The regulations are
international in their scope but the losses have been their most severe in
the developing world.
It took the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise with the loss of 193
lives in March 1987 to show that standards needed to be raised even in the
traditional shipping nations.
An official inquiry concluded that the British ferry, owned by P &amp; O, sank
because a crewman left the bow doors open. The ship's officers failed to
notice because of a culture of 'sloppiness' throughout the P &amp; O subsidiary
that operated the ship.
The inquiry recommended a series of safety improvements, such as higher
vehicle decks, closed circuit TV supervision of bow and stern doors, better
emergency lighting, loading and stability checks, and passenger and vehicle
listing.
The loss of the Herald of Free Enterprise prompted the British government to
push for a stricter interpretation of the international safety rules than
most countries were prepared to accept.
The result has been that the UK and nine other European nations, including
Sweden, have imposed tougher regulations on the stability of ferries and
have insisted on their more rapid application to existing, as well as to
new, vessels. These rules come into effect in two days' time.
These stability rules are unlikely to have had any impact on the Estonia,
however, which was regarded as a well found vessel designed to operate in
the frequently ice-bound Baltic. Investigators will undoubtedly be looking
closely at how the crew carried out their duties.
And for all the wealth of safety legislation there has been little progress
in overcoming the biggest single safety problem on roll-on roll-off ferries
 -the open vehicle decks running from one end of the ship to the other,
usually with doors at one or both ends.
One survivor of yesterday's sinking suggested that one of the forward
loading ramps of the Estonia had not shut properly while another report
suggested that the loading door seals were faulty.
Shipowners maintain that ro-ro ferries are viable only if large numbers of
vehicles can be loaded and unloaded quickly, allowing rapid turnround times
and frequent sailings.
This means that neither space nor time is wasted, but comparatively small
quantities of water entering the vehicle decks can cause the ship to develop
a heavy list, and capsize.
This problem, called the free surface effect, was what sank the Herald. It
can be prevented, but only by inserting vertical bulkheads across the
vehicle deck, which would slow loading.
For all the good intentions transformed into international safety
agreements, the IMO and governments around the world have come to realise
that effective enforcement of the rules is still woefully lacking.
The IMO is shifting its attention to ensuring that its many maritime
agreements are enforced and recently reached agreement to give port
authorities greater powers to inspect visiting shipping. Traditionally the
country under whose flag a ship sails is responsible for ensuring that the
vessel is well built and well maintained. But the failure of many 'flags of
convenience' to take these duties seriously has seen power shift to the
authorities in the port where the ship docks.
The west European countries work together to enforce shipping standards
through their port organisations while similar regional groupings of 'port
states' are being put together in other parts of the world.
Estonia, newly independent after the break-up of the Soviet Union, has yet
to establish a track-record in the supervision of the ships which sail under
its flag. But the Swedish involvement in the ship's ownership is seen as a
guarantee of quality.
It will be some time before the official enquiries which are just beginning
provide an explanation for the loss of the Estonia. But the loss of a
relatively modern vessel in rough but not unusual seas raises worrying
questions about the effectiveness of the regulations and their enforcement.
