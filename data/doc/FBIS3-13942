  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton has voiced his 
discomfort over the media's distortion of his stand on 
Jerusalem, which some sides interpreted as an approval of 
Israel's position that unified Jerusalem is Israel's capital. 
  A U.S. State Department official told AL-ITTIHAD that the 
United States regrets such a distortion of President Clinton's 
position and stresses that the U.S. position on Jerusalem has 
not changed and that Clinton had announced that the status of 
Jerusalem would be decided during negotiations in accordance 
with the contents of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles.
