  [Text] Tirana, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The editor and a journalist 
on an independent Albanian newspaper have been arrested for 
publishing a secret Defence Ministry document, prosecutors said 
Monday [31 January]. 
  Alexander Srangaj, editor of the KOHA JONE newspaper, and 
Martin Leka, a journalist on the paper, could face up to 10 and 
five years in prison respectively if found guilty of leaking a 
state secret. 
  The charges concern defence orders on arms issued to 
officers 
signed by Defence Minister Safet Zhulali, which prosecutors 
alleged were distorted in a story written by Leka. 
  Srangaj spent 35 days under house arrest last year after 
being arrested for publishing false information concerning the 
movement of Albanian tanks towards the Yugoslav frontier. 
  KOHA JONE denied the allegation in an article that said it 
was not the paper's business to keep secrets. "Can information 
that will be distributed to all officers and their families 
really be called a secret?" the newspaper asked.
