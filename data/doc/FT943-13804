FT  18 JUL 94 / Observer: Whizzbangs and harriers
Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence minister, was sniped at last week for some
swingeing armed forces' cuts. So perhaps it's only fair to award him a DCM -
the Distinguished Conservation Medal - for leaving one unit untouched.
Surviving to fight another day is the four-strong Ministry of Defence
Conservation Unit, based in Chessington. Its job is promoting and protecting
the wildlife and ancient monuments inhabiting the vast expanses of MoD land
 -much of which gets crushed by tanks or blasted by bombs.
James Baker, the retired colonel in charge, was delighted but not astonished
to have escaped the axe: 'We have some of the best sites for butterflies,
reptiles and bats in the country . . . we're at the forefront of the
conservation drive.'
Baker argues that artillery craters are good for flowers - the shell-holes
open up the soil - and that bullet holes cause trees to ooze resin, so
attracting lichens.
The latest issue of Sanctuary, the unit's annual magazine, carries articles
on birds inhabiting the weapons-testing area at Foulness; choughs on the
Castlemartin tank firing range in Pembrokeshire; and moths at Porton Down,
site of the MoD's chemical weapons research plant.
A piece on orchids and butterflies at the Arpinge Ranges in Kent says: 'The
MoD has preserved a precious landscape which might long ago have disappeared
if subjected to the commercial pressures of modern farming.'
Presumably flying shrapnel deters the nest-raiders, too.
