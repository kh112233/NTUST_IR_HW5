FT  27 NOV 93 / Germany bans Kurd militants
The German government yesterday banned the separatist Kurdistan Workers
Party, the PKK, and 35 related groupings, calming popular fears that Germany
was becoming a breeding ground for foreign extremism, Ariane Genillard
reports from Bonn.
Police also raided over 100 Kurdish homes and offices across the country.
The PKK, which demands independence for Kurdistan in south-east Turkey, is
believed to have orchestrated a wave of attacks against Turkish properties
across Europe. The move was welcomed by the Turkish community in Germany
whose members have often violently clashed with resident Kurds.
