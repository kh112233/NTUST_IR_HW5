FT  15 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right attitude for isle
Sir, The article by James Buxton with its beautiful photograph ('Superquarry
caught in centre of debate', October 10) omits the most important aspect of
this controversy.
Scotia Pharmaceuticals at Callanish, on the adjoining Isle of Lewis, has
said that a proposed plant utilising marine algae can no longer be situated
on Harris if quarrying takes place there, or indeed anywhere within 30
miles, so sensitive is the project to pollution, although an alternative
site can be found somewhere else within the isles.
This proposed pilot plant would apparently employ 10 persons initially,
rising to 60 eventually, all of them in high quality jobs. Moreover, Scotia,
which has a good record of job creation in the isles, is perceived as
considerate in its attitude to the people, while Redland is accused of
arrogance and disdain.
