INDIANAN BECOMES 28TH WOMAN IN 101ST CONGRESS -- A RECORD 
Rep. Jill Long officially claimed her Indiana House seat Wednesday during a 
brief swearing-in ceremony. 
House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas administered the oath of office to Long, the 
first Democrat to represent Indiana's 4th Congressional District in 12 years. 
The Indiana lawmaker became the 28th woman to serve in the 101st Congress, an 
all-time high for female members, according to the Women's Campaign Fund. 
Long pledged to work with members on both sides of the aisle to meet the 
challenges facing the nation. 
"I want my colleagues to know how committed I am to extending my hand, not just 
to Democrats, but also to Republicans, because by working together we can solve 
those challenges for the next century," she said. 
Long narrowly defeated Republican Dan Heath in a special election to replace 
Rep. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), who was appointed to fill Vice President Dan Quayle's 
Senate seat.
