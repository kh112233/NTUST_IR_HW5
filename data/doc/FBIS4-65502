  [Excerpt] Gelsenkirchen (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has asked the German people to "bluntly renounce" those 
who are intellectually paving the way for xenophobic acts of 
violence in Germany. "Regardless of where it comes from, 
violence cannot and must not have any place in our country," the 
minister told 2,500 people at a German-foreign friendship 
festival in Gelsenkirchen. 
  "We again have reason to be ashamed of ourselves," Kinkel 
said, and also expressed his deepest sorrow on behalf of the 
Federal Government for Thursday's [12 May] riots in Magdeburg. 
It is a task for all of society to show solidarity and to say: 
This country is friendly toward foreigners. [passage omitted]
