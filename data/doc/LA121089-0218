COLD WAR'S THAW PUTS A CHILL ON SDI CONTRACTORS; 
DEFENSE: BUDGET CUTS AND IMPROVING EAST-WEST RELATIONS MEAN BELT-TIGHTENING FOR 
SEVERAL ORANGE COUNTY FIRMS INVOLVED IN THE CONTROVERSIAL STRATEGIC DEFENSE 
INITIATIVE. 
In late November, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. Vice President Daniel 
Green dashed off to Washington after learning that a "Star Wars" program 
potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars to his firm might be shot 
down by the Defense Department. 
Green's mission: to persuade Pentagon bigwigs that a ground-launched missile 
program known in Star Wars jargon as the High Endoatmospheric Defense 
Interceptor, or HEDI, was worth saving. 
McDonnell Douglas won a partial victory. Although the program's budget will be 
slashed next year, company officials say the Pentagon has assured them that 
enough money will remain to perform critical flight tests. Even so, Space 
Systems of Huntington Beach will have to cut its HEDI staffing by about 60 jobs 
in 1990. 
"We ended up with the next-to-the-bottom thing on our list," said Green, the 
company's general manager of strategic systems. "The bottom was termination." 
At least seven Orange County companies have won contracts worth several hundred 
million dollars since the controversial missile defense program, formally known 
as the Strategic Defense Initiative, was launched by President Ronald Reagan in 
1983. By far the largest share of that money has gone to McDonnell Douglas and 
Rockwell International Corp., two of the nation's biggest Star Wars 
contractors. 
Local companies that do SDI work already are making adjustments for a major 
change in the year ahead: stingier budgets. In November, President Bush signed 
a $286-billion defense spending bill that included $3.8 billion for SDI for 
fiscal year 1990, which began Oct. 1. That amount is $1.1 billion less than the 
administration had originally sought for the program and marks the first budget 
reduction in the program's history. 
Moreover, SDI may face additional big cuts in funding over the next several 
years as part of a major reassessment of Pentagon spending in light of arms 
control negotiations, the warming U.S.-Soviet relations and the sweeping 
political and economic changes taking place in Eastern Europe. 
" 'Star Wars' ' political fortunes are directly related to the state of 
Soviet-American relations," said John E. Pike, a space policy analyst for the 
Federation of American Scientists in Washington. "Over the past six years, 
Soviet-American relations have grown progressively better, and the future of 
'Star Wars' has become more uncertain." 
In recent months, the Bush Administration has significantly scaled back its 
official expectations for the program. Originally proposed by Reagan as an 
impenetrable shield of space-based defenses, administration officials now 
acknowledge that SDI would offer only partial protection against incoming 
missiles. 
An informal survey of local companies involved in SDI work found that most are 
anticipating cuts or cancellations for their programs. A few programs, however, 
will grow in 1990. 
Large contractors such as McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell will not suffer too 
badly even should the major programs be scrubbed. SDI contracts comprise only a 
small fraction of their overall businesses. But smaller firms that count on SDI 
work for a major share of their sales will be affected severely. 
"The outlook is not too good," said Mitch Thomas, president of L'Garde Inc., a 
small Tustin aerospace firm that relies on "Star Wars" contracts for 60% of its 
business. In anticipation of cuts in the SDI program, L'Garde began laying off 
workers last year, trimming the staff from a peak of 55 people to 37. 
"Everyone said that as soon as Reagan went out of office, the program was going 
to take some cuts," Thomas said. L'Garde, which specializes in inflatable space 
devices and electronic systems, is scrambling for non-SDI contracts from the 
Pentagon or from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, although, 
he said, both organizations' budgets "are not in the best of shape." 
Another local company concerned about program cuts is SRS Technologies, a 
Newport Beach aerospace research and engineering firm that has slices of eight 
SDI programs and had contracts totaling $8 million for them in 1989. 
SRS Technologies thrived during the "Star Wars" era, with sales soaring from 
$6.3 million in fiscal 1983 to $40 million in the year that ended Aug. 31. SDI 
contracts comprise 20% of the firm's sales. 
Mohindar S. Sandhu, SRS Technologies president, said SDI cuts are threatening 
several contracts worth several million dollars a year. One contract likely to 
be canceled involves development of an X-ray radar device to distinguish real 
nuclear bombs from decoy targets in space. That contract was worth $800,000 to 
the company last year alone. 
But there may be a silver lining in the cloud. SRS hopes to adapt the X-ray 
technology for medical and other defense applications. The technology could 
potentially be used to improve the techniques for administering radiation 
treatment to cancer patients. Another possibility is to use X-ray technology to 
monitor compliance with arms-control treaties. 
Sandhu said he understands that the scaling back of the "Star Wars" program is 
being driven at least in part by the changes on the international scene, 
especially in the easing of East-West tensions. 
He says he is concerned, however, "that the powers that be might go overboard 
in the cuts. . . . It's not certain what's going to happen in Russia. Someone 
could come around and knock off (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev, and the 
Soviet Union might go back to its previous ways." 
McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in Huntington Beach is the prime contractor for 
several key SDI programs. The company has received more than $300 million to 
develop the HEDI missile interceptor, a kinetic-energy weapon that would 
destroy enemy warheads during the final phase of their flight by slamming into 
them with projectiles at extremely high speeds. 
McDonnell Douglas has sought $100 million for HEDI for the fiscal year that 
began in October. Although the company has not received formal word from the 
Pentagon, the amount will probably be slashed to between $65 million and $70 
million, said Green, who is the company's marketing manager for SDI programs. 
The budget reductions will force the Army to stretch out work on the HEDI 
program. The first in a series of flight tests is scheduled for early next year 
at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico., but subsequent tests will be 
delayed by about a year. 
Pike, of the Federation of American Scientists, says HEDI could face a troubled 
future because it is "a big, expensive, long-term program that doesn't fit 
into" the Pentagon's plans for deploying the first phase of "Star Wars" around 
the turn of the century. 
Rockwell has built a $30-million Strategic Defense Center in Seal Beach for the 
purpose of administering its SDI contracts and conducting research and 
development. The company had SDI contracts totaling $778 million in 1988. More 
current figures were unavailable from the company. 
Rockwell, which is based in El Segundo, is the prime contractor on the 
Space-Based Interceptor program, a collection of low-flying satellites that 
would fire high-energy projectiles known as "smart rocks" at missiles, 
destroying them on impact. 
However, experts see the space-based segments of the SDI program as 
particularly vulnerable to budget cuts. Rockwell officials declined requests 
for interviews about the company's SDI programs. 
Another program SDI watchers say may be in jeopardy is TRW Inc.'s laser 
development program. TRW maintains a test site for the laser project at its 
2,000-acre research facility near San Clemente. 
Under a $250-million contract with the government, TRW uses the site to test an 
antimissile weapon known as the Alpha, a potent chemical laser, for use in the 
SDI program. 
The laser program, now in the early stages of development, calls for the weapon 
to be installed on a space-based platform to test its abilities to both detect 
and destroy incoming missiles armed with nuclear warheads. 
The Alpha laser was originally scheduled to be sent into space as part of an 
experiment known as Zenith Star in 1994. But a Pentagon spokesman said the 
flight test date has been pushed back to the mid- to late 1990s. 
The Alpha laser has been one of the most disputed parts of the "Star Wars" 
program, as experts have argued over whether its operation in space would 
violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. 
According to Pike, the laser program is also vulnerable to cancellation because 
of its high cost and doubts about whether it is technically feasible. The 
program "may have gone off into Never-Never Land," he said. 
TRW spokeswoman Montye C. Male said: "To date, we have not been told the 
program is going to be cut." 
The news for local SDI contractors is not all gloomy, though. 
Although the Space Systems unit expects to cut its HEDI program staff by 30%, 
or 60 positions, another SDI program will increase by 100 employees next year, 
McDonnell Douglas said. That program -- a ground-based surveillance and 
tracking system -- involves developing sophisticated sensors, or "eyes in 
space," that would be launched upon attack to track incoming nuclear warheads. 
McDonnell Douglas expects to receive about $50 million for the sensor program 
in 1990. 
And officials at the Hughes Aircraft Ground Systems Group in Fullerton say they 
expect a modest increase in SDI funding next year. In September, Ground Systems 
won a $53-million SDI contract to develop an elaborate computer system for 
simulating enemy missile attacks. The work will be done at the company's 
Huntsville, Ala., plant. 
"Our SDI programs are doing well," said Dan Reeder, a Hughes spokesman. "The 
dollar value is up quite a bit from last year. The dollars are there. 
Everything is secure for now." Hughes has several smaller SDI programs, 
including one to develop "neural networks," or computers designed to operate 
more like the human brain. 
SRS Technologies' Sandhu, who also visited SDI headquarters in Washington last 
month to lobby for his company's programs, said the gung-ho atmosphere that 
prevailed during the Reagan Administration has given way to gloom. 
"It's kind of a downbeat atmosphere because of the budget cuts and rumors of 
significant cuts in 1991," Sandhu said. "The world is changing, and I don't 
think the Bush Administration is putting the best case forward to Congress to 
justify these technologies." 
 'STAR WARS' DOLLARS 
Several Orange County companies are involved in the Strategic Defense 
Initiative program and are concerned about the future of their contracts as 
money for the program is cut.
