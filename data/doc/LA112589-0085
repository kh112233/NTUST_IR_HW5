BOMB FOUND IN LUGGAGE ON SAUDI JUMBO JET 
Police on Friday found a time bomb in luggage taken from a Saudi Airlines jumbo 
jet with 248 people aboard. Only a loose wire stopped it from exploding over 
the Arabian Sea, officials said. 
"We have recovered a bomb in a bag which was not tagged," said an officer of 
the paramilitary Karachi Airport Security Force, who identified himself only as 
Ashraf. 
A security force commander said the bomb would have destroyed the terminal of 
Karachi's airport in addition to the plane had it gone off after the jet landed 
here. 
Only a loose battery wire prevented it from blowing up Thursday evening as the 
plane was heading from Islamabad, Pakistan, to the Saudi city of Riyadh, 
officials said. 
A taxi driver in Islamabad had delivered an envelope containing a note 
threatening to destroy the plane unless authorities paid $1.5 million, they 
said. The aircraft then was ordered to land at Karachi, where security 
officials found the bomb. 
Officials said they questioned all passengers and crew members but had not made 
any arrests. They refused to say if they had any suspects or whether any group 
had claimed responsibility.
