SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The inventions available for licensing area:







NIST Docket No. 90030D
Title:

 Monomers For Double Ring-Opening Polymerization With Expansion


Description:

 NIST researchers have created a new class of monomers that undergo double ring-opening polymerization with an expansion
in volume. When used in resinous compositions the result is a volume neutral curing process at ambient temperature,
and a final product that exhibits high adhesive strength.






NIST Docket No. 90036
Title:

 Epitaxial Iron Films Exhibiting Large Polar Kerr Rotation


Description:

 The invention is a magneto-optic iron film that greatly enhances Kerr rotation compared with conventional iron films.
The material could be utilized in magneto-optic data storage media.







NIST Docket No. 93028C
Title:

 Nanocomposite Material for Magnetic Refrigeration and Superparamagnetic System using the Same


Description:

 NIST researchers have developed new materials and systems that make magnetic refrigeration practical for household
uses. The materials are atomically-engineered superparamagnetic materials that exhibit a large magnetocaloric
effect at selected temperatures.







NIST Docket No. 93042
Title:

 Photochromic Compositions and Materials Containing Bacteriorhodopsin


Description:

 This invention is a method to form photochromic compositions and materials from the light-sensitive protein, bacteriorhodopsin.
The invention can be used to record and store information in real time.







NIST Docket No. 93047
Title:

 Process For UVPhotopatterning of Thiolate Monolayers Self-Assembled on Gold, Silver and Other Substrates


Description:

 New NIST technology provides a photopatterning process to precisely control the spatial position of thiol compounds
on a surface. The process creates a monolayer that can be used to bind biological species such as proteins or enzymes
at known locations on a surface, and could be very important for a variety of technologies including biosensing, immunoassay
diagnostics, pharmacological testing, and cell growth studies.








NIST Docket No. 94017CIP
Title:

 Method and Apparatus for Visualization of Internal Stresses in Solid Non-Transparent Materials by Ultrasonic Techniques
and Ultrasonic Computer Tomography of Stress


Description:

 New NIST technology makes visualing internal stresses in sold materials in three dimensions possible. By using an
acoustic microscope, an ultrasonic generator and a computer, this technology provides for the measurement of residual
stresses and their distribution as a function of depth.
