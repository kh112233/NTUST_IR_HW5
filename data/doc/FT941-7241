FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Bid for STC Submarine cleared
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission has cleared the Pounds 600m bid for
STC Submarine Systems by Alcatel Alsthom, the French communications
equipment supplier.
Alcatel's purchase of the UK submarine systems supplier from Northern
Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment supplier which bought STC
in 1990, is expected to be finalised soon.
The sale makes Alcatel Europe's only large telecommunications submarine
systems supplier. Its main competitors are AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications
company, and Fujitsu and NEC, the Japanese suppliers.
Mr Pierre Suard, Alcatel's chief executive, said the merger of the two
businesses 'will allow the European industry to confront world competition
with maximum advantage'.
He cited, in particular, competition for the Flag project - fibre optic
links around the globe - the largest network of undersea cables ever
tendered, where Alcatel would be in strong competition with the US and
Japanese suppliers.
Contracts are likely to be awarded later this year.
