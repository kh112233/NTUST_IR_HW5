FT  03 JUN 92 / Observer: Some signal
The Earth Summit kicks off today with a bizarre award for the mayor of
Mexico City in recognition of what some see as his less than impressive
efforts to reduce the city's pollution levels. The award has surprised
Mexicans, not just because ozone levels this year have reached record
heights, but the measures taken can hardly be held up as a model for the
whole globe.
Earlier this year the mayor took to making almost daily announcements about
who could, and could not, drive their car on a certain day, in a panic
response that seemed designed to create the greatest amount of inconvenience
for the smallest possible benefit. Other more worthy winners - including the
mayors of Saarbrucken in Germany and Kitakyushu in Japan - can hardly take
pleasure from being lumped together with the world's smog capital.
