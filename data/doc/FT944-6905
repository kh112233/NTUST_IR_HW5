FT  28 NOV 94 / Volkswagen to produce new Beetle
Volkswagen, the German carmaker, has decided to press ahead with the
development of a modern-day Beetle with the aim of starting production
towards the end of the decade, writes Kevin Done, Motor Industry
Correspondent.
VW first showed a 'back to the future' concept study for a new generation
Beetle, 'Concept 1' (pictured above), at the Detroit motor show last January
to gauge market reaction, particularly in the US. The existing Beetle, the
world's best-selling car with output totalling more than 21m, is still
assembled in Brazil and Mexico.
The Concept 1 was designed by Volkswagen's Californian design studio. The
body shape of the new car will be derived from the familiar rounded design
of the old Beetle, but mechanically it would be a modern car. It would have
a front-mounted engine instead of the classic rear-mounted, air-cooled
engine of the old Beetle, and would have modern safety features such as
airbags and anti-lock brakes.
The Beetle, the original 'people's car' which Volkswagen was founded to
build, was designed by the German engineer Mr Ferdinand Porsche in 1934,
shortly after Adolf Hitler came to power. Volkswagen said yesterday that the
most likely production location for the new Beetle was the VW plant at
Puebla, Mexico.
