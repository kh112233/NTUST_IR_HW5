SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 East Valley Farms, Inc. has proposed to lease a 40-acre allotment from Joseph Kintano of the Torres Martinez Band of
Cahuilla Indians for the purpose of constructing and operating a biosolids (digested sewage sludge) composting
facility. The facility would be operated by Pima Gro Systems, Inc., a sister company of East Valley Farms. The facility
would receive daily shipments of treated Class B sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants at other locations
in southern California. Approximately 15,000 tons per month of sludge would be delivered to the facility by truck.
Pima Gro proposes to use an aerated windrow compost process to produce 8,000 tons per month of fully treated and composted
material. The compost product would be sold to agricultural users and nurseries for use as a soil amendment.



The project site is located in the Coachella Valley in south-central Riverside County approximately 35 miles southeast
of the city of Palm Springs. The project vicinity is generally rural with agriculture and aquaculture being the predominant
land uses.

The EIS will address numerous environmental issues, including: geology and soils, water quality, air quality, (including
odor and dust), health and safety, biological resources, cultural resources, traffic, land use, and noise, as well
as any additional issues raised during the scoping process.
