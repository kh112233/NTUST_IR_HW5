FT  16 FEB 93 / Germans call for aid in curbing illegal migrants
INTERIOR ministers from east and west Europe gathering in Budapest yesterday
for a conference on migration were immediately pressed by Germany to help
curb the influx of illegal immigrants.
Germany is urging east European countries to take back nationals resident
elsewhere without permission, and speed migrants' return to their country of
origin. Also high on the agenda is a proposal to co-ordinate action on
international 'human smuggling' groups.
The Germans want 'non-front-line' western countries to share the burden of
financial aid towards strengthening eastern Europe's immigration controls.
The conference coincides with German efforts to tighten the country's
liberal asylum rules.
Germany's proposed constitutional amendment would allow authorities to turn
back claimants for refugee status if they arrive from 'safe' neighbouring
east European countries. Poland and the Czech Republic are determined not to
become a cordon sanitaire for seekers of asylum in Germany.
Bonn's efforts have an added urgency because of continuing racist attacks
against foreigners. But EC countries less affected by immigration from
eastern Europe are grudging in their solidarity. UK officials said yesterday
that, while backing recommendations on exchange of information, they did not
wish to see new measures, describing as unrealistic ideas about financial
aid.
