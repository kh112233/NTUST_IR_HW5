FT  25 AUG 93 / Crime chief in warning to City
THE NEW head of the National Criminal Intelligence Service said financial
institutions risked being undermined by large-scale money laundering by
criminals.
Mr Albert Pacey, 54, former chief constable of Gloucestershire, said: 'We
are concerned that the public, who are rightly anxious about street crime,
will, as a result, forget the hidden dangers of sophisticated drug
trafficking, fraud, money laundering and major robberies and burglaries.
Its financial intelligence unit had assessed more than 16,000 disclosures
from banks and other financial houses on suspicious transactions - one in
eight had led to further police or Customs inquiries.
Its counterfeit currency unit has provided information for seven police
operations netting more than Pounds 8m in forged sterling.
The service was launched 17 months ago to co-ordinate the combating of
serious crime.
