FT  08 JUN 93 / English tests gain mixed reaction
THE NATIONAL curriculum test papers in English reading and writing for
14-year-olds, published by the Department for Education yesterday, received
a mixed reaction from teachers and educationalists.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, predicted that 'most people will
look at the papers and wonder what all the the fuss was about and wonder why
their children have not been asked to take them'.
However, Ms Ann Barnes of the National Association for the Teaching of
English criticised the tests. She said: 'They are very narrow in their
approach. They do not provide opportunities for the most able pupils to show
what they can do, and they do not provide any opportunities for any sort of
proper reflection on the passage they are asked to read and I think they
probably present very specific hurdles for the lesser pupils.'
She added that the tests in literature, including Shakespeare and a
prescribed anthology, had aroused much more controversy. They are due to be
published tomorrow.
Three tests were available, aimed at pupils of differing abilities. Most
children were entered by their teachers for tier 5-7, aimed at 14-year-olds
of average ability, while about one third were put in for the lower tier and
4 per cent for the higher tier.
The middle-ability tests offered 15 marks for questions on a passage about a
voyage around the coast of Britain, and then 10 marks each for summarising a
job description for flight attendants, filling in gaps in a passage using
multiple choice options, and paraphrasing the transcript of an interview.
Pupils were then required to write a letter of 120-150 words, requesting
information for a school project.
