FT  07 NOV 92 / Letter: Witness to increasing arrogance of the media
Sir, Returning to Britain after some years, Ian Davidson ('British patience
runs dry', November 2) finds himself shocked by the volume and the violence
of criticism to which the government is subjected and suggests Mr Major is
in a class of his own in the depth and intensity of media criticism of his
administration.
As an adult resident of this country for the last 40 years I, too, am
shocked at its continuing slide into acceptance of media manipulation of its
mind, and I applaud Mr Major, Mr Smith and Mr Ashdown for ignoring the
amazing accusations made against their everyday ability by those who purport
to speak freely for the electorate. It was refreshing recently to read in
your paper that Mr Lamont does not feel he has to read it regularly.
We are witnessing, in this country particularly, an alarming (for some) and
increasing arrogance among the media, which has an avarice for a new
sensation a day to keep it going.
Unfortunately, a large part of the community continue to feed the media by
avidly reading, listening and watching; and applauding, it would seem, that
very sentiment.
We are witnessing and are powerless; unless your good journal and one or two
other media quality disseminators awake to publish comment on this rumbling
coup d'etat to our leadership and our very constitution by those who speak
and wave their hands but are unable to govern themselves (or themselves).
They are a terrible band of brothers who maintain that 'freedom of speech'
means anybody can say almost anything under its banner, but whose main aim
is to increase their audience and own sense of well-being.
In Britain the time for anger certainly appears to have arrived and we might
start by not condoning such media activity, by not purchasing it and by
speaking out against it when it appears before us.
