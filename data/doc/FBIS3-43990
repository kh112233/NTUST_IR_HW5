  [Text] In Cote d'Ivoire supporters of former Prime Minister 
Alassane Ouattara had to meet bad fortune with good hearts. 
Several hundred persons could not welcome the former Ivorian 
prime minister who was returning from Paris after three weeks' 
stay. Tight security was deployed yesterday around Abidjan 
Airport to prevent Alassane Ouattara's supporters from forcing 
their way through the airport. 
  [London BBC World Service in English at 0600 GMT on 23 
January in a related report adds the following: "In Ivory Coast, 
government forces, some armed with tear gas, have mounted a big 
security operation to prevent supporters welcoming home the 
former prime minister, Alassane Ouattara. The security forces 
blocked off access roads around Abidjan Airport, but about 100 
of Mr. Ouattara's supporters managed to step through the 
security cordon to give him an enthusiastic welcome on his 
return from France."]
