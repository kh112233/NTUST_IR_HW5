FT  07 JUL 94 / Jailing in Pechiney affair
The Paris appeal court yesterday jailed Mr Alain Boublil, former chief aide
to Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the late Socialist prime minister, after finding him
guilty of insider trading in the 'Pechiney affair'. He was sentenced to two
years, one of them suspended. Last September, Mr Boublil was acquitted by a
lower court which fined seven other men up to FFr25m (Pounds 2.9m) and
confiscated FFr30m in illicit profits made from buying shares at Dollars 10
in late 1988 in Triangle, a US company, just before the state-controlled
Pechiney made a bid of Dollars 56 a share. The court heard that Mr Boublil
tipped off the late Mr Roger-Patrice Pelat, a friend of President Francois
Mitterrand, about Pechiney's plan to bid for a subsidiary of Triangle, a US
company. The court upheld a two-year suspended sentence and FFr2.5m fine
imposed on another defendant, Mr Max Theret. He admitted Mr Pelat had tipped
him off 'in a vague way' about the bid. The verdict reflects the French
judiciary's tougher attitude to white-collar crime.
