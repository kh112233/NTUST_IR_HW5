METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $100,000 IN COUNTERFEIT BILLS FISHED FROM 
HARBOR 
U.S. Treasury agents fished more than $100,000 in bogus $20 bills from Long 
Beach Harbor on Thursday, part of a batch counterfeiters have been passing for 
at least two years, authorities said. 
Since December, 1987, 19 people have been arrested in Phoenix, the Midwest and 
San Diego for passing the bills, said Jim Miller, assistant special agent in 
charge of the Secret Service's Los Angeles office. 
Authorities found $62,000 in the same counterfeit $20 bills in Long Beach 
Harbor last February, Miller said. He theorized that the counterfeiters dumped 
the bills to avoid further arrests.
