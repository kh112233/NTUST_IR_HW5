FT  29 JUN 93 / Reuters 'warned of RSI danger'
REUTERS news agency, the employer of a journalist who lost his job after
developing repetitive strain injury (RSI), had been warned beforehand of the
health risks of new computer technology, the High Court was told yesterday.
Yet Reuters did nothing about the problem until Mr Rafiq Mughal began
suffering from RSI, the court heard.
Mr Mughal is suing his former employer for compensation in a test case that
could have widespread implications for other journalists and users of
computer keyboards. Reuters denies liability.
Mr Mughal was employed by Reuters between September 1987 and December 1989
and developed RSI when he became chief sub-editor on the equities desk, Mr
John Foy, his counsel, said.
Mr Mughal, whose action is backed by the National Union of Journalists, had
spent all his working time using a computer keyboard, and his case was that
this had caused him to suffer injury.
He has not worked for the past four years and says he has lost more than
Pounds 85,000 in salary. He is claiming compensation for pain and suffering
as well as loss of earnings.
A central issue was the extent to which Mr Mughal's keyboard work caused his
injury, Mr Foy said.
The case continues.
