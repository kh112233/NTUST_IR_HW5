<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive world-wide license to
practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Applications SN 07/861,249 and 08/065,618 both entitled ``Calanolide
Antiviral Compounds, Compositions and Uses Thereof'' and related foreign patent applications to MediChem Research,
Inc. of Lemont, IL. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America. 


The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. It is anticipated that this license may be limited to the field of treatment of AIDS. This prospective
exclusive license may be granted unless within 60 days from the date of this published notice, NIH receives written
evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent with the requirements
of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
The patent applications describe the chemical structures of and methods for isolating and purifying coumarins from
an extract of the tropical rain forest trees Calophyllum langerum and a related species in the genus, Calophyllum
teysmannii. This new class of compounds and their analogs, also referred to as calanolides and costatolides respectively,
strongly inhibit HIV1 replication and cytopathicity in vitro. These compounds may have advantageous pharmacologic,
toxicologic, and/or antiviral properties, especially in the treatment of AIDS.
