  [Text] Nemuro, Hokkaido, 17 May KYODO -- A 48-member 
Japanese delegation returned to Nemuro on Tuesday [17 May] night 
after a four-day trip to Etorofu Island, one of four disputed 
Russian islands claimed by Japan, under a visa-free exchange 
program, tour organizers said. 
  The group landed at Nayoka on Etorofu on Sunday morning and 
stayed at the houses of local residents. 
  Bad weather forced the cancellation of events scheduled for 
Monday before departing for Nemuro. 
  The mission included 24 former residents of the island and 
nine members involved in a campaign for the return to Japan of 
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets. 
  A similar Japanese group visited Kunashiri earlier this 
month 
under the three-year-old visa-free exchange program. It was the 
first group of the year to travel to the disputed islands. 
  A Russian group visited Hokkaido in April. 
  The four islands were seized by Soviet troops at the end of 
World War II.
