  [Text] The fishermen of Japan, South Korea, and the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea have received their 
fishing quotas for the central part of the Okhotsk Sea. 
However, Chinese representatives were denied these rights. The 
fact is that, last year, Chinese fishing vessels were often 
involved in poaching in the Russian Federation's economic zone 
which includes the territorial waters of Kamchatka. 
Justifiably, their crews were repeatedly detained by fishing 
protection vessels and coast guard ships.
