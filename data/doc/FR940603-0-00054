Designated Critical Habitat; Northern Right Whale 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.

 

</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.

 


</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS is designating critical habitat for the northern right whale (

Eubalaena glacialis

). The designated habitat includes portions of Cape Cod Bay and Stellwagen Bank, the Great South Channel (each off
the coast of Massachusetts), and waters adjacent to the coasts of Georgia and the east coast of Florida. This designation
provides notice to Federal agencies and the public that a listed species is dependent on these areas and features for
its continued existence and that any Federal action that may affect these areas or features is subject to the consultation
requirements of section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

 July 5, 1994.

Fisheries Service (NMFS), 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910.

Background 



Right whales, 

Eubalaena

 spp., are the most endangered of the large whale species, brought to extremely low levels by commercial whaling. Right
whales were the earliest targets of whaling and, although they have been protected world-wide from commercial whaling
by international agreements since 1935, right whale populations still remain extremely depleted. The global population
of right whales is comprised of two separate species, one each in both the northern and southern hemisphere, and several
stocks or populations within each hemisphere. The majority of right whales occur in the southern hemisphere (the
southern right whale, 

E. australis

) and are considered a separate species from the right whale in the northern hemisphere 
(

E. glacialis

). 

At least two populations of northern right whales, an eastern and a western population, occur, or have occurred, in
the North Atlantic. The eastern North Atlantic population may be nearly extinct. Between 19351985, there
were only 21 possible sightings in the eastern North Atlantic, totaling 45 individuals (Brown, 1986). Furthermore,
Brown (1986) considered only five of these sightings (seven individual whales) to be confirmed. In the western North
Atlantic, the known distribution and abundance of right whales indicate a ``best available'' population estimate
of 300350 individuals. Despite the low abundance and known anthropogenic factors affecting total mortality
(Kraus, 1990), the western North Atlantic stock is the largest in the Northern Hemisphere. This population stands
to benefit most from recovery actions (NMFS, 1991; Kenney, Winn and Macaulay, 1994). 

Like other baleen whales, the western North Atlantic population of right whales (hereafter referred to as the northern
right whale) is migratory. The known distribution and migratory pattern has been previously summarized by Kraus
(1985); Winn, Price and Sorensen (1986); Gaskin (1987, 1991); and by Kraus et al. (1986). The five primary habitats
used by northern right whales during their annual migration, as described by Kenney, Winn and Macaulay (1994), include
the following three areas off the eastern coast of the United States: (1) A spring/early summer feeding and nursery
area for a majority of the population in the Great South Channel (GSC), (2) a late winter/spring feeding and nursery
area for a small portion of the population in Cape Cod Bay (CCB), and (3) a winter calving ground and nursery area in the
coastal waters of the southeastern United States (SEUS); and the following two areas located in Canadian waters:
(4) a summer/fall feeding and nursery area for some animals, including nearly all mother/calf pairs, in the lower
Bay of Fundy; and (5) a summer/fall feeding ground, with almost exclusively mature individuals, on the southern Nova
Scotian shelf. 

The northern right whale was listed as endangered on June 2, 1970 (35 FR 8495). Section 9 of the ESA prohibits the taking
of endangered species, and section 7 requires Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize
either threatened and endangered species. For species listed prior to 1978, when Congress required that critical
habitat be designated, concurrently with the listing, critical habitat may be designated although such designation
is not required. Section 4(f) of the ESA also requires the responsible agency to develop and implement a recovery plan
for listed species, unless such a plan would not promote the conservation and recovery of the species. NMFS determined
that a recovery plan would promote the conservation of the northern right whale. Accordingly, the Assistant Administrator
for Fisheries (AA) appointed a Recovery Team consisting of experts on right whales from the private sector, academia
and government. A Recovery Plan for the Northern Right Whale was approved by NMFS in December, 1991 (NMFS, 1991). 

NMFS was petitioned by the Right Whale Recovery Team to designate critical habitat for the northern right whale on
May 18, 1990. A 

Federal Register

 notice was published on July 12, 1990 (55 FR 28670), requesting information and comments on the petition. Of those
agencies, organizations, and private groups that commented, most responded favorably to the designation of the
three areas in the U.S. as critical habitat for the northern right whale. The comments received were considered and
incorporated as appropriate by NMFS in the proposed rule to designate critical habitat for northern right whales.
The proposed rule was published on May 19, 1993 (58 FR 29186), and provided for a 60-day comment period. NMFS also completed
an Environmental Assesment (EA) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to evaluate both the environmental
and economic impacts of the proposed critical habitat designation. The EA resulted in a finding of no significant
impact for the proposed action.
