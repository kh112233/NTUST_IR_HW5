  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 03, BNS -- The three Baltic presidents 
-- Lennart Meri of Estonia, Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia and 
Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania -- called on international 
efforts to speed the withdrawal of the Russian troops from 
Estonia and Latvia in their New Year's joint appeal. 
  The full text of the appeal follows: 1993 was a year of 
tremendous progress for all three Baltic countries. The last 
Russian troops were withdrawn from Lithuania and some units were 
removed from Estonia and Latvia as well. All three countries 
made enormous political progress strengthening themselves at 
home through open, fair and free elections at various levels and 
their ties with foreign countries through skillful and active 
diplomacy. And all three countries made important strides in the 
difficult process of economic recovery. 
  But the year ahead promises to be an even more fateful one. 
During 1994 critical decision will be made and important steps 
taken that will determine the future of the entire region. 
Consequently as we look back to what we have achieved in the 
past year with pride, we must nonetheless be fully conscious of 
how much work still lies ahead, specifically: 
  - we call on all on all Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians 
to work together to build on the political and economic 
achievements of the past, 
  - we call on the Baltic peoples to continue their efforts to 
promote peace and stability throughout the region, and 
  - we call on Russian President Boris Yeltsin not to remove 
from his commitment to complete the final withdrawal of Russian 
troops from Estonia and Latvia in 1994, and on the nations of 
the world to continue their efforts to promote this outcome.
