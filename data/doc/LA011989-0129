UC IRVINE TENNIS PLAYERS SURVIVE CLOSE CALL AT HOME 
Three UC Irvine tennis players survived a close call Saturday night when a 
faulty heater in their Newport Beach apartment leaked carbon monoxide gas. 
Mark Kaplan, Richard Lubner and Mike Saunders were treated and released from 
area hospitals after feeling ill when they awakened Sunday morning. The players 
got up at 8 a.m. because they were supposed to participate in a clinic for high 
school coaches at Irvine. 
That might have saved their lives. 
"We all woke up with a dry cough and the same aches and pains in our lower 
back," Lubner said. "We got up and drove over to the (Irvine) courts to tell 
Coach (Greg) Patton we were sick. Then we went to the (school's) medical 
center. 
"Mark sleeps closest to the heater and he felt the worst. I think he was the 
first to say he thought it might be some kind of gas." 
Medical center personnel called paramedics, and hospital blood tests revealed 
the carbon monoxide poisoning, which did not reach dangerous levels. 
Lubner said one of the paramedics told him they were indeed very fortunate: "He 
said it makes you very, very sleepy, and some guys don't wake up." 
The gas company replaced the heating unit Wednesday, Lubner said, but the 
players have not been able to contact their landlord. "What's done is done. . . 
. We don't want to point fingers. We just want to get back to tennis," he said.
