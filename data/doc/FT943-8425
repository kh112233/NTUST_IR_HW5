FT  17 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Cantab losses rise to Pounds 1.85m at six
months
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the biotechnology company quoted both in London and
on Nasdaq in the US, yesterday reported losses increased from Pounds 1.24m
to Pounds 1.85m for the first half of 1994.
The results were in line with expectations, said Dr Paul Haycock, chief
executive of the Cambridge-based company. Operating losses widened from
Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 2.27m, as revenues fell from Pounds 618,000 to Pounds
424,000. Interest income improved from Pounds 157,000 to Pounds 419,000,
following the Pounds 13.8m placing last October.
Research and development spending rose from Pounds 1.51m to Pounds 2.17m
over the same period, as the company developed its herpes and genital warts
treatments.
Losses per share fell from 21p to 19p.
Dr Haycock said the company had net cash of Pounds 17.8m, and while he did
not expect to ask investors for additional funding this year, he did not
rule out returning to them next year.
Cantab expects to start final stage European clinical trials for its most
advanced product, LM-CD45, a drug designed to reduce the incidence of
rejection in kidney transplant operations.
