CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA; 
STATE TAKES ACTION TO PROTECT SALMON 
The state Water Resources Control Board has acted to tighten its control of the 
temperature of water in the Sacramento River in an effort to improve spawning 
conditions for salmon. The board adopted a new order recognizing a fact known 
to fishing experts for years -- water temperatures in the Sacramento below the 
Shasta and Keswick dams can rise above 60 degrees in mid-autumn, with 
devastating effects on salmon spawning. Fisheries biologists consider the 
maximum safe spawning temperature for Chinook salmon to be 57.5 degrees. The 
board's action makes the quality of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's releases 
into the Sacramento a "water rights" issue directly affecting the permits under 
which the federal agency operates the Central Valley Project, California's 
largest water distribution system.
