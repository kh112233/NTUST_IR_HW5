FT  17 OCT 92 / EC agrees deal on maternity protection
THE European Community maternity directive, providing minimum protection for
pregnant women at work, has finally been agreed after several weeks of
wrangling.
The Italian government, which was holding out for a better deal, is likely
to abstain on the directive, which means that it can be passed at a meeting
on Monday, hours before the directive was due to lapse.
If the Italians decide not to abstain, the directive will still be passed,
as the European Commission has accepted a compromise which was agreed
yesterday.
The compromise lays down that the EC's social affairs council will prepare a
report on the directive after four years and the European Commission will
present an evaluation and, if necessary, a proposal for review no later than
five years after the directive is adopted.
The directive will improve protection in only a few countries - including
Britain - but it has been accepted by most member countries as better than
nothing at all.
The original generous provisions for maternity pay which had been proposed
by the European Commission were watered down to a right to receive 14 weeks'
pay at a level no lower than statutory sick pay.
However, the new deal will improve employment protection for British women,
by requiring employers to keep open a job for a woman who has a child
regardless of how long she has been employed.
At present in the UK, protection only applies after two years' continuous
employment. Women are then entitled to six weeks' maternity leave on 90 per
cent of full pay and a further 12 weeks on maternity benefit of Pounds 46.30
a week.
