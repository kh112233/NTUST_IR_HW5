FOUR SEAMEN MISSING 
Four seamen were missing Monday after a Spanish freighter ran aground and sank 
in heavy seas off northwest Spain, maritime officials said. The other seven 
crew members of the 1,454-ton Baitin were rescued. 
The freighter reportedly ran aground after its cargo of salt shifted.
