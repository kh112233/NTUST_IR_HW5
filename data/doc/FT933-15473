FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Nucor boosts sheet steel output
NUCOR, the leading US steel mini-mill group, yesterday announced plans to
expand substantially its production of sheet steel. The move increases the
threat it poses in this sector of the US market to traditional, integrated
steel manufacturers.
Nucor is to increase production at its Hickman, Arkansas, mill by 67 per
cent, from 1.2m tons a year to 2m tons a year by the third quarter of 1994.
The company said this would cost less than Dollars 35m, and would require
only a 15 per cent increase in the number of employees at the plant.
Hickman, which began operations only last year, is the second Nucor plant to
use a new method of making sheet steel, called thin-slab casting.
The method was pioneered at the company's plant in Crawfordsville, Indiana,
which began operations in 1989. The plant makes steel much more cheaply than
conventional methods, since it cuts out several stages of the manufacturing
process.
This has presented new competition to the large, integrated US steel
companies. Until Crawfordsville began operating, the smaller, low-cost
mini-mills had not had the financial muscle to break into the sheet market,
which enjoys some of the industry's highest margins.
Nucor announced last April that it was also expanding Crawfordsville's
annual capacity, from 1m tons a year to 1.8m tons.
The company said yesterday that by the end of 1994 the total steel-making
capacity for all of its seven steel mills should be close to 8m tons a year.
This could make it the third-largest steel manufacturer in the US, after US
Steel and Bethlehem Steel.
