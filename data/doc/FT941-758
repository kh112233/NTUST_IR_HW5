FT  29 MAR 94 / Compensation for Lockerbie road
Pan Am, the former US airline, has paid more than Pounds 175,000 in
compensation for damage to a road caused when Flight 103 was blown out of
the sky over Lockerbie in 1988.
Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, started legal action against the airline
last week when it was thought that the bill was unpaid.
The action alleged negligence by Pan Am for the explosion over Lockerbie
which killed 270 people in that the airline failed to prevent explosive
devices being taken on board the aircraft.
But it turned out that Pan Am's insurers had wired the money from the US two
weeks ago. The Scottish Office admitted that there had been an
administrative 'blip'.
