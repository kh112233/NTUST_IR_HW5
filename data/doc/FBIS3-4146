  [Text] Paris, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Parliamentarians from 
111 countries endorsed a string of resolutions during the 91st 
meeting of the Interparliamentary Union [IPU] here. 
  The 560 representatives passed a plan to remove cultural and 
religious obstacles barring women from participating in politics 
and encouraged women's participation in legislation and 
policy-making. 
  The six-day meeting which ended Saturday also produced a 
declaration providing standards for free and fair elections. 
Such standards, the first the international community has ever 
defined, would serve as a basis for any national election and a 
guide for international observers. 
  The parliamentarians also called on the international 
community to review the structure of the United Nations to give 
it a wider world role and more power to prevent conflicts. 
  The meeting also urged all nations to commit to the cause of 
environmental preservation and the tightening of controls on 
hazardous waste. 
  They also urged efforts toward the overall prohibition of 
the 
production of fissionable materials and nuclear testing. 
  Burundi, Macedonia, the Comoros, Zaire and the Central 
African Republic became members of the Interparliamentary Union, 
enlarging its membership to 129 nations. 
  The next session will be held in Copenhagen this September 
12-17.
