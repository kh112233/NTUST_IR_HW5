FT  10 AUG 94 / Clean water arrives in Rwandan refugee camps
Rwandan refugees carry away containers of clean water from a United Nations
tanker supervised by US military members in Kibumba camp, Zaire.
Meanwhile, strikes and clashes shut down Burundi's capital Bujumbura for a
second day yesterday and authorities stepped up security on fears the
country may follow neighbouring Rwanda down the path to conflict. At least
15 people have died in the clashes involving youths of the minority Tutsi
tribe.
Aid officials warned aid operations to refugees in south-west Rwanda and
eastern Zaire may be affected unless the security situation improved.
