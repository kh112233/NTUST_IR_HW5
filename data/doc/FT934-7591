FT  19 NOV 93 / Egypt's terror-hit tourism 'recovers'
EGYPT'S tourism industry is recovering from the effects of Islamic extremist
attacks, with 100 per cent hotel occupancy rates in the Red Sea and Sinai
resorts and 49 per cent occupancy in Luxor, Mr Mamdouh Ahmed Beltagui, the
country's new tourism minister, said yesterday.
He said the figures for September augured well for the main season just
starting after a year in which arrivals have been down 20 per cent on 1992
and receipts down by almost Dollars 1bn on last year's Dollars 3bn.
Mr Beltagui, in London to sign a regional tourism agreement with Turkey and
Israel, said a number of travel agencies which had dropped Egyptian packages
from their promotional literature had agreed to resume publicity.
The revival of Egypt's biggest foreign exchange earner had been confirmed,
he said, by EPounds 4.7bn of new investment in the industry through the
official tourism agency alone, 80 per cent of it private enterprise.
Almost 2m visitors had been recorded between January and September against
the 3.2m for all of last year.
He attributed the upturn on a successful clampdown on fundamentalists, in
which at least seven militants have been hanged for the murder of three
foreign tourists, but said Egypt was still suffering from adverse media
coverage. There was less danger for visitors to Egypt than to Londoners from
the Irish Republican Army.
