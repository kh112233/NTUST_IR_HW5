FT  20 FEB 92 / Air raising plan for Mexican pollution
MEXICO CITY'S government is considering installing 100 giant hot-air
ventilators across the nation's capital, in a bizarre effort to blow
pollution away from the city.
Mr Manuel Camacho, the city's mayor, has embraced the proposal, saying it
'could not be faulted theoretically.' The ventilators would be an additional
tool in the fight against pollution, he said.
The devices would supposedly create an effect similar to a hurricane,
lifting the pollution - and conceivably anything else not firmly bolted to
the ground - from the capital.
The idea is to place 100 ventilators roughly every 1,000 square metres in
specially designated parks or gardens, at a cost of around Dollars 100m
(Pounds 57m). The ventilators would consist of a series of fans, and an
incinerator that would heat the air between the fans, to blast polluted air
from the mountain-ringed capital.
The scheme has generated enormous publicity, mostly sceptical. 'The project
has no technical foundation whatsoever,' said Mr Luis Manuel Guerra,
director of the Autonomous Institute of Ecological Research, Mexico's
leading ecological research institution.
'To think that you can solve the problem of ozone with this device shows a
complete lack of knowledge of the atmospheric chemistry of ozone.' The
incinerators will burn natural gas, and thus worsen the city's ozone
problem, according to Mr Guerra.
The scheme was originally proposed by one of Mexico's most distinguished
leftwing opposition politicians, Mr Herberto Castillo, who is also a civil
engineer.
The ventilator scheme was announced on the day ozone reached 'very
dangerous' levels, prompting the government to enforce strict anti-smog
measures. Certain industries were required to cut production by between 30
and 40 per cent and people were urged to use public transport.
No decision will be made on the ventilator scheme until further studies are
completed.
