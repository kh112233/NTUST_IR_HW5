FT  20 MAY 94 / Argentina seeks UK N-investment
Argentina is hoping to attract UK investment in its soon-to-be privatised
nuclear industry, as a result of a series of contacts at government and
company level, according to senior officials.
Mr Carlos Bastos, Argentine energy minister, has been in London this week on
an official visit which marks a further step in the normalisation of
UK-Argentine relations since the Falklands War in 1982.
Mr Bastos, who was invited to the UK by the Foreign Office, met his
counterpart at the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Timothy Eggar. The
DTI described the talks as 'friendly and constructive', but refused detailed
comment.
Argentine officials say their country has no political objections to British
companies operating its two nuclear power stations, Atucha I and Atucha II.
Argentina has also offered to co-operate with international research and
development of a cost-effective, safe standard nuclear reactor.
Last month, Babcock Energy, based at Renfrew in Scotland, was awarded a
Pounds 5.5m (Dollars 8.25m) contract to supply computer-controlled,
ultra-sonic equipment for the reactor pressure vessel of Atucha II. National
Grid and British Gas have also invested in Argentina's energy sector.
Since announcing in 1991 that it was scrapping its controversial Condor II
missile project (originally aimed at the Falklands), Argentina has set out
to reassure the international community about its nuclear ambitions. Last
November, it ratified the 1967 Tlatelolco Treaty banning nuclear weapons in
Latin America.
