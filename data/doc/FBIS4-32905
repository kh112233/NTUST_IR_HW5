  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 28 May (EFE) -- At least six 
people, including one policeman, one soldier, and one civilian, 
were killed today in three different guerrilla actions in 
Colombia, the day before the presidential elections. At the 
same time, the authorities decided to suspend elections in 12 
small communities in the Simiti Municipality, Bolivar 
Department, in the northern Colombia, due to guerrilla threats. 
  A Defense Ministry source said the most serious incident 
took 
place in a rural area known as Caguan, in southern Colombia, 
when a group of insurgents attacked and murdered a policeman, a 
soldier, and a woman. In this clash, one of the rebels was 
killed. He belonged to the communist Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia (FARC). 
  Near Baraya, in Huila Department, also in southern Colombia, 
a rebel was killed and two more were captured at a military 
checkpoint, when they tried to attack the troops. The same 
source reported that in the Uraba area, in Colombia's northeast, 
the Army foiled an attack against a police garrison in Carepa, 
where one guerrilla was killed. 
  Electoral authorities decided to suspend elections in 12 
small communities in the Simiti Municipality. Simiti Mayor 
Elias Escalante said the decision to suspend the elections was 
made because the presence of guerrillas did not allow National 
Civil Registry (an organization in charge of the elections) 
delegates to go to these small communities. Simiti is located 
about 900 km north of Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  On Sunday, Colombians will elect President Cesar Gaviria's 
successor from among 18 candidates, even though runoff elections 
on 19 June will probably need to be held because it is unlikely 
any of the candidates will reach an absolute majority according 
to previous polls.
