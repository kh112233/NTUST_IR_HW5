FT  10 SEP 93 / Observer: Pissaloux passe?
Jacques de Larosiere has just made his first visit to the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development since becoming president-elect of the bank.
In a speech to directors and vice-presidents, he hinted at changes that
pleased almost everyone.
Moreover, with a political deftness learned at the Bank of France and the
IMF, he took considerable care not to make any binding commitments.
The directors were delighted when he promised to consult them on strategic
issues rather more than had his predecessor, Jacques Attali.
However, one executive who might be feeling vulnerable following de
Larosiere's speech is Pierre Pissaloux.
Pissaloux was in charge of the inordinately expensive project to fit out the
bank's London headquarters.
Originally, he had two grand titles at the bank. At the start he was both
budget director and director of the president's cabinet; but following the
news of the bank's high-spending on its refurbishments, Pissaloux
relinquished the budget job.
Now his remaining responsibilities would seem to be under a sword of
Damocles - de Larosiere has apparently informed the EBRD's directors that he
sees no need for a presidential cabinet.
