FT  20 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexican oil giant raises
production
PETROLEOS MEXICANOS, Mexico's oil giant, has celebrated the 54th anniversary
of its foundation by releasing a string of figures revealing increases in
production and export volumes and productivity improvements, writes Damian
Fraser in Mexico City.
Nevertheless, the news was tempered by yet another fall in Pemex's official
reserves to 65bn barrels, in oil equivalent terms, from 65.5bn in 1990.
Further, income from hydrocarbons and petrochemicals exports dropped from
Dollars 10bn in 1990 to Dollars 8.15bn last year, reflecting lower oil
prices, and Mexico imported a record Dollars 1.25bn worth of petroleum and
petrochemical products, mainly due to purchases abroad of an average 68,200
barrels of oil a day.
Overall, Mexico's trade surplus in oil fell from Dollars 9bn in 1990 to
Dollars 6.9bn last year.
The apparent contradiction between rising production and increasing imports
stems from booming domestic demand in refined products that Pemex has been
unable to meet. Pemex announced it would start building a new refinery in
January 1993 to meet this gap, and invest heavily in providing cleaner,
environment-friendly fuels. It also claimed the fall in reserves would be
reversed this year because of important new discoveries.
Pemex's total crude production rose to 2.676m barrels a day in 1991, up 4.7
per cent on 1990, of which exports equalled exports 1.369m b/d, up 6.5 per
cent. Pemex has increased production by 10 per cent since 1987, despite
cutting its workforce from more than 200,000 people to current level of just
over 150,000.
