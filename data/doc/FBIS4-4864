  [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- A discount race is 
intensifying in the recession-plagued steel industry as Tokyo 
Steel Mfg. Co., Japan's top electric furnace steelmaker, 
announced plans this week to lower prices of H-beam steel for 
construction firms. 
  Nippon Steel Corp., the world's largest steel manufacturer, 
and other major blast furnace steelmakers have joined Tokyo 
Steel in cutting prices of H-beam steel for construction firms 
to make up for slumping demand from automobile and electric 
appliance industries. Tokyo Steel's decision was regarded as a 
challenge to blast furnace steelmakers in anticipation of growth 
in demand for H-beam steel for public works projects, industry 
sources said. 
  The company earlier said it will join four major blast 
furnace steelmakers in marketing steel sheet piles for the 
construction industry. 
  Tokyo steel said it will slash prices of H-beam steel to 
33,000 yen per ton from 40,000 yen. It also said it plans to 
sell steel sheet-pyles at 55,000 yen per ton, far below the 
present average price of around 100,000 yen. 
  The company has opened new branches in Nagoya, Fukuoka, 
Hiroshima and Takamatsu to step up sales of steel products for 
the construction industry.
