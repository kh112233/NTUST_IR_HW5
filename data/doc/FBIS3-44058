<F P=106> [National Party Statement on the ANC election list issued by </F>
the NP Federal Council on 21 January 1994 on the SAPA PR Wire 
Service] 
  [Text] The ANC's [African National Congress] election list 
poses a grave danger to South Africa. The SACP [South African 
Communist Party] has succeeded in its aim to get a stranglehold 
on the ANC's list. Of the first 50 candidates 27 are member of 
the SACP (54!) with another possible seven. It is clear that the 
SACP has concentrated its efforts to be in the top of the list, 
as fewer SACP members are listed further town. In the second 
group of 50 there are 15 SACP (30!) members with a possibility 
of six more. In the third 50, eight SACP (16!) members, with 2 
more possibilities. [numbers in parentheses as received] 
  Other main features of the list are: 
  The absence of all the celebrities whom the ANC had misused 
to attract attention to their list. It is clear that many of 
these celebrities do not regard the ANC as an organisation which 
they want to be associated with. 
  The fact that some of the ANC's allies have been given a 
cold 
shoulder as illustrated by the fact that Labour Party members 
are relegated to positions low down on the list. 
  The fact that the ANC is persevering with the inclusion of 
Mrs Winnie Mandela, who has been given a senior position. It 
was unthinkable that in a democratic society that somebody who 
has been convicted of a serious common crime, especially one of 
kidnapping a child, is placed in a position where she may attain 
political power. 
  It is clear that the moderates in the ANC have been 
outmanouvred by the SACP and other militant elements will be 
placed in a position to take control of the ANC and defeat the 
ANC's moderate elements. 
  All South Africans who believe in true democracy, federal 
principles and a free market economy, must now ignore the minor 
differences that exist between them and unite to prevent the 
names on this election list ever to become the strongest party 
in Parliament.
