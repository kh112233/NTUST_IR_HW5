  [Text] AL-MU'TAMAR paper reports in its issue yesterday, 
Friday, that an armed group from the Iraqi opposition forces 
attacked one of the regime's intelligence service centers in 
Baghdad. Sources told AL-MU'TAMAR that the attack took place on 
the night of 7 June and targeted the center, which is located 
opposite the central market building in al-Mansur city. This 
was the same center where British journalist Farzad Bazoft was 
detained in 1990.
