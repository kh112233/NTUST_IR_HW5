As they prepare for hibernation, hundreds of black bears are foraging for 
"everything in sight" around Lake Tahoe, wildlife officials said. Residents 
were warned not to leave bacon grease or other smelly foods in garbage cans 
that would attract bears. Game biologist Gary Herron said that bears eat a wide 
variety of animal and vegetable matter and that garbage is "one of their 
favorites." Homeowners were advised to put out garbage cans for collection just 
before pickup and to wrap smelly garbage in plastic or sprinkle ammonia around 
the trash area to mask odors.
