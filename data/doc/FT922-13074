FT  14 APR 92 / Mandela and wife decide to separate
MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), said
yesterday that he and his wife, Mrs Winnie Mandela, had decided to separate
after 33 years.
The move follows renewed allegations that Mrs Mandela viciously beat four
young men in her Johannesburg home in 1988. One subsequently died. Mrs
Mandela's lawyers yesterday denied the allegations and Mr Mandela said they
had nothing to do with his decision to seek a separation.
Mr Mandela's voice broke with emotion when he read out a statement
announcing the separation. He praised his wife's role in opposing apartheid
and in resisting government harassment during the ANC leader's 27 years in
jail.
'My love for her remains undiminished,' he said. However, the couple decided
to separate because tensions had arisen 'owing to differences between
ourselves on a number of issues'. Mrs Mandela takes a more radical political
stand than her husband.
