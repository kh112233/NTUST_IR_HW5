BRIEFLY 
Amgen to Sell Drug in Japan: Amgen Inc., a Thousand Oaks biotechnology concern, 
said its Japanese partner received government approval to sell Amgen's 
anti-anemia drug in Japan to patients with kidney problems. Kirin Brewery Co. 
will sell the drug, erythropoietin, under the trade name Espo in Japan where 
about 80,000 people suffer from anemia due to kidney failure, Amgen said. Amgen 
began selling the drug in the United States last June but is locked in a 
dispute with competitor Genetics Institute over U.S. marketing rights for the 
drug.
