FT  09 JUL 93 / Egypt hangs seven for terrorism
SEVEN Islamic militants were hanged in Egypt yesterday on charges of
attacking foreign tourists and seeking to overthrow the government - the
greatest number of executions for political crimes in the country's recent
history. Five were hanged in 1982 for assassinating President Anwar Sadat.
The seven were convicted by a military court in April of six separate bomb
and firearm attacks on tourist buses and Nile cruisers late last year, in
one of which a young Englishwoman was killed.
The men were among 49 tried in the case, including six in absentia, who had
proclaimed loyalty to the Gamaa al-Islamiyya extremist group which has
claimed responsibility for attacks on tourism and security forces over a
year.
A total of 22 individuals have been sentenced to death in trials arising
from politically-motivated violence since December last year. President
Hosni Mubarak has made a point of publicly ratifying each one to signal his
government's resolve to crush the threat from Islamic extremists.
Five more men face the scaffold later this month after being convicted in
May for their part in four bombings and an attempt on the life of Mr Safwat
Sherif, the information minister, who escaped a shooting near his Cairo home
with light injuries last April.
The government's determination to mete out the severest penalties possible
on Islamic militants comes despite rising opposition from western and
domestic human rights groups both to the use of the death penalty and to the
conduct of trials by military courts.
