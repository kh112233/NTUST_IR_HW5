FT  12 MAY 92 / Judith Ward is freed by court
MISS JUDITH WARD, jailed for life in 1974 for the M62 Army coach bombing in
which 12 people died, was freed on bail yesterday by the Court of Appeal
pending the formal quashing of her convictions.
The court ruled that confessions made by Miss Ward, 43, to the M62 attack
and two other bombings could no longer be relied on and her conviction was
therefore 'unsafe and unsatisfactory'.
Lord Justice Glidewell told her that her appeal would be allowed in due
course but the court wanted to continue hearing evidence on scientific
aspects of the case.
At her trial in 1974, scientific evidence was presented by Dr Frank Skuse,
the former Home Office forensic scientist, that Miss Ward had handled
nitroglycerine. The test used was discredited last year during the appeal of
the Birmingham Six.
Miss Ward, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, was sentenced to life
imprisonment with concurrent 30-year terms for complicity in the other
bombings, in spite of evidence, available at the time, that she was mentally
ill and prone to inventing stories about her involvement with the IRA.
Her release after 18 years in jail brings to an end a series of miscarriages
of justice stemming from the 1974 IRA mainland bombing campaign. The cases
of the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven and the Birmingham Six prompted the
government to appoint a royal commission on criminal justice under the
chairmanship of Lord Runciman.
The commission's report, to be published next year, is expected to lead to
an overhaul of the criminal appeal system. West Yorkshire police, who
investigated the M62 bombing, last night expressed regret for the years Miss
Ward had spent in prison.
Mr Tom Cook, assistant chief constable, said they would re-examine evidence
gathered at the time of the bombing.
