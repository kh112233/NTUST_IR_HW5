FT  25 OCT 94 / Algeria killings condemned
Amnesty International has condemned the Algerian government and its
fundamentalist opponents for extra-judicial killings, saying security forces
and armed Islamist groups have acted in total disregard of international and
humanitarian law. A report today, 'Algeria, Repression and Violence Must
End', says 'hundreds are reported extra-judicially killed by the security
forces, as an alternative to arrest or in retaliation for killings by armed
Islamist groups'. These groups 'have delibrately and arbitrarily killed
hundreds of civilians', including those known for their stance against the
Islamist groups' political agenda.
