  [Text] An Egyptian delegation led by Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa left for South Africa early this morning to attend the 
inauguration of President Nelson Mandela tomorrow, Tuesday. 
Before leaving, Musa expressed Egypt's happiness at the new era 
in South Africa, which has culminated the long struggle of the 
people there. This, he said, is a major success for Africa. He 
said he will convey to President Mandela a message from Husni 
Mubarak as president of Egypt and chairman of the OAU, which is 
pleased with the independence of this big country that will soon 
join the organization. 
  The foreign minister pointed out Egypt's contribution to the 
supervision of South Africa's elections, which were completely 
free. He said Egypt and South Africa will work to promote their 
relations, and noted that Egypt will resume diplomatic relations 
with South Africa tomorrow. 
  The foreign minister said he will leave South Africa for 
London Wednesday on an official visit to Britain. He said he 
will hold talks with British Prime Minister John Major, Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd, and senior Foreign Office and House of 
Commons officials on issues of concern to the two countries and 
ways to boost bilateral ties. He said the Lockerbie issue will 
be one of the topics of discussion with the British officials.
