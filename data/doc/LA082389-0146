P.M. BRIEFING; 
FORD TO RECALL 450,000 CARS 
The Environmental Protection Agency said today that Ford Motor Co. will recall 
about 450,000 late-model Ford and Mercury cars that exceed federal hydrocarbon 
exhaust emission standards. 
The EPA said Ford agreed to install a new air-control valve to increase airflow 
into the exhaust manifold for more complete combustion of exhaust gases. 
Cars registered in California, built to tougher emission standards, are not 
involved in the recall, the EPA said.
