JUDGE CRITICIZED OVER ROSE PROBE DROPS BOOKIE CASE 
The federal judge who came under fire for criticizing baseball's investigation 
of Pete Rose has removed himself from sentencing an Ohio bookmaker who claims 
he took bets from Rose. 
U.S. District Judge Carl B. Rubin sent a one-line order to the court clerk 
taking himself off the case of Ronald Peters, who has said he will plead guilty 
to tax evasion and drug trafficking charges. 
The court has assigned Judge S. Arthur Spiegel to sentence Peters. No 
sentencing date has been set. 
A story in the Cleveland Plain Dealer this morning quoted Linda Kloth, chief 
administrator of the federal court in Cincinnati, as saying Rubin would remove 
himself because "he just felt there was an appearance of impropriety" because 
of his publicly stated views on the investigation. 
Rubin accused baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti last Friday of 
"entering into . . . a vendetta against Pete Rose," according to a transcript 
of a conference in the judge's chambers.
