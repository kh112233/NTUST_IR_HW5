Arms Exports"] 
  [Text] The international community must set stricter rules 
for the trade in light weapons. That way conflicts in 
developing countries in particular could be managed and 
prevented. 
  Cooperation Development Minister Pronk made his comments 
yesterday in a speech at Groningen University. He referred to 
the importance of much tighter policies on arms exports. Pronk 
said that the proliferation of light weapons like mortars, 
grenades, land mines and machine guns caused more instability 
than the proliferation of heavy weapons. That had been proved 
in practice. Out of the 30 large armed conflicts which took 
place in the world in 1993, 26 were fought virtually entirely 
with small and light weapons. 
  Pronk said that the countries of the former Soviet Union and 
the Central and East European states in particular should 
increase their monitoring of light arm exports.
