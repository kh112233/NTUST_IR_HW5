 

NHTSA believes that the same considerations that apply to alcohol dual fueled vehicles also apply to ones fueled by
other liquids. The agency is unaware of any other potentially available liquid alternative fuels that would have
a significantly higher energy content than alcohol on a volume basis. Assuming that other liquid alternative fuels
do not have a significantly higher energy content, a driving range greater than 200 miles for dual fueled passenger
automobiles using any liquid fuel could necessitate redesign of the vehicles to accommodate a larger fuel tank. The
agency requests comments on whether there are any potentially available liquid alternative fuels that do have a significantly
higher energy content than alcohol on a volume basis, and, if so, whether a driving range higher than 200 miles should
be set for such fuels. Depending on the comments, the agency may set a higher driving range for such vehicles. 


The above discussion assumes that the same fuel tank could be used for both the alternative liquid fuel and gasoline,
as is the case for alcohol dual fueled vehicles. If a separate fuel tank were required for the alternative liquid fuel,
the limited available space in a passenger automobile for such an additional tank would be an even more critical reason
not to set the minimum driving range above 200 miles. 


Gaseous fuels always require a separate fuel tank from gasoline or diesel fuel. In the previous rulemaking concerning
minimum driving range, the agency's concerns about the limited available space in a passenger automobile for additional
fuel tanks led it to establish a 100 mile minimum driving range for natural gas dual fueled vehicles. 


Given the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act, NHTSA has tentatively concluded that the minimum driving range
for these vehicles should be increased to 200 miles. As discussed above, the agency cannot set a lower minimum driving
range for these vehicles. Moreover, NHTSA believes that the minimum range should not be greater than 200 miles because
such a range could discourage manufacturers from producing natural gas dual fueled vehicles, given the limited available
space for additional fuel tanks. The agency notes that the concerns it expressed in 1990 about a driving range greater
than 100 miles for these vehicles would be of even greater significance for ranges above 200 miles. 


The same considerations that apply to natural gas dual fueled vehicles also apply to dual fueled vehicles using other
gaseous fuels, since all of these vehicles require a separate fuel tank from gasoline or diesel fuel. Therefore, the
agency is proposing to establish a 200 mile driving range for these vehicles as well. 



B. Proposed Gallon Equivalents for Gaseous Fuels 




In order to carry out the special procedures for fuel economy calculations that apply to alternative fuel vehicles,
it is necessary, for gaseous fuel vehicles, to have a gallons equivalent measurement. The 1992 amendments to the Cost
Savings Act specified that 100 cubic feet of natural gas is deemed to contain 0.823 gallon equivalent of gasoline.
The 1992 amendments required NHTSA to determine the appropriate gallons equivalent measurement for gaseous fuels
other than natural gas, and a gallon equivalent of such gaseous fuel shall be considered to have a fuel content of 15
one-hundredths of a gallon of fuel. 


As part of determining appropriate gallons equivalent measurements for gaseous fuels, NHTSA consulted with the
Department of Energy (DOE) Fuels Utilization Data and Analysis Division. NHTSA and DOE agreed that the following
gaseous fuels could be potential transportation fuels by 2008: liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG), and hydrogen. 


Pursuant to a contract with DOE, Abacus Technology Corporation prepared a report titled ``Energy Equivalent Values
of Three Alternative Fuels: Liquefied Natural Gas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, and Hydrogen.'' This report is available
for review at the docket number cited in the heading of this notice. The Abacus report develops gallons equivalent
measurements for LNG, LPG, and hydrogen gaseous fuels. 



After reviewing the Abacus report, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Mobile Sources recommended
adding hythane fuel (a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas (principally methane)) as a gaseous fuel for which a gallon
equivalent should be calculated. EPA stated that although hythane is currently being used and evaluated on a limited
basis, there is a possibility that hythane fuel may become commercially available as a gaseous fuel. In a follow-up
report, which is also available in the docket, Abacus developed an appropriate gallon equivalent measurement for
hythane. 


NHTSA notes that Abacus recommended using lower heating values for deriving the gallons equivalent measurements
for gaseous fuels because this value represents the energy available from combustion in an engine. 




1. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)



The first Abacus report noted that the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 included natural gas as an alternative fuel,
but did not specify its physical state as a compressed gas or a liquefied gas. The report assumed that the Act was referring
to compressed natural gas, which was the more familiar technology when the Act was passed. The Abacus report recommended
that the same 0.823 gallon equivalent of natural gas established in the Alternative Motor Fuels Act be applied to LNG
based on energy content in British Thermal Unit (BTU)/Standard Cubic Feet (SCF), because LNG composition and heat
of combustion are similar to compressed natural gas. 




2. Liquefied Propane Gas (LPG) 



The Gas Processors Association Standard 214092 specifies four grades of LPG. They are commercial propane,
commercial butane, commercial butane-propane mixtures, and propane HD5. Propane HD5 is recognized
as the most suitable fuel for internal combustion engines operating at moderate to high engine severity. The Abacus
report concluded that one gallon of LPG, grade HD5, is equivalent to 0.732 gallon of gasoline, using a lower
heating value.
