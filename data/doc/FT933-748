FT  28 SEP 93 / Rabin 'held talks with Hussein'
MR YITZHAK RABIN, the Israeli prime minister, is believed to have held
secret talks with King Hussein in order to allay the Jordanian monarch's
suspicions over Israel's autonomy agreement with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
Mr Rabin abruptly cancelled a scheduled address in Jerusalem on Sunday
evening and disappeared for about six hours. Overnight, the Israeli military
censor prevented Israel Radio from broadcasting rumours of a secret meeting.
Mr Rabin's office said yesterday that he had been attending a 'military
exercise' but, pressed further, a spokesman said that even if Mr Rabin had
been meeting King Hussein, none of his officials was going to confirm it.
Although Jordan remains formally in a state of war with Israel, King Hussein
is widely believed to have met frequently, if secretly, every Israeli prime
minister since Mrs Golda Meir more than two decades ago.
While supporting the Israeli-PLO accord, the Jordanian monarch is known to
have been displeased that it was concluded without his involvement and to
have misgivings over the possible implications for his country, home to more
than 1m Palestinian refugees.
The two leaders appeared in separate interviews on the American NBC
television network yesterday, both discussing the possibility of progress on
the Israeli-Syrian front following the Israeli-PLO deal and the agreed
Israel-Jordan 'peace agenda'. King Hussein said he believed Syria's
President Hafez el-Assad was genuinely seeking peace with Israel. Mr Rabin
said he felt the Syrians could be doing more to signal such intent.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is expected to fly to the
Middle East next month, primarily to mediate between Mr Rabin and Mr Assad.
