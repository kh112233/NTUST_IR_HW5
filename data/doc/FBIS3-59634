  [Text] Windpower plants can capture 20-30 percent more 
energy with a new type of rotor blade profile. The new long 
blade was developed in a cooperative effort between a Danish 
manufacturer and Swedish aerodynamics experts. 
  Airplane wings have long served as a model for windpower 
plants' rotor blades. 
  But a windpower plant's rotor blades are exposed to a large 
variation in the wind's angle of attack. 
  "The rotor blades should preferably have a broader spectrum 
of optimum efficiency than airplane wings," said development 
chief Peter Grabau of LM Glasfiber, the biggest supplier of wind 
turbine blades in the world. 
  These ideas were also found at Sweden's FFA, the 
Aeronautical 
Research Institute, in Ulvsunda outside Stockholm. 
<H5>  Sharper Leading Edge </H5>
  When the FFA was asked to design a new rotor blade profile 
the result was a sharper leading edge than before. The blade has 
lower lift capacity but better performance before it stalls. 
  Stall means that above a certain speed the wind "loses its 
grip" on the rotor blade. With increasing wind the wind's angle 
of attack increases so that finally the air escapes from the 
suction side of the profile. In an airplane this means that lift 
ceases. In a windpower plant it means that the rotor blade 
checks the wind instead of being driven around by it. 
<H5>  Reduced Maximum Output </H5>
  The wing for LM Glasfiber was given a triangular profile 
which makes it stall at a lower wind speed than before. The 
power plant's maximum output may be reduced which, somewhat 
paradoxically, is an advantage. Generators and gear boxes do not 
have to be dimensioned for great wind speeds. 
  "One can simply capture more energy from the wind in the 
wind 
area that lies below the generator's maximum output," said 
Anders Bjorck of FFA. 
  This is done by increasing the length of the blade. 
  To fine-tune stall properties parts of the blade have been 
given a triangular profile, a so-called stall-strip. 
<H5>  Longer Wings </H5>
  With a well-defined stall LM Glasfiber can build longer 
wings 
for existing power plants or hold down dimensions on generators 
for new plants and still get greater yield. 
  "Larger wings mean that energy production is increased by 
20-30 percent," said Peter Grabau of LM Glasfiber. 
  The FFA's work for the Danish rotor blade manufacturer could 
benefit Swedish wind power indirectly. The FFA also cooperates 
with Nordic Windpower (AF Industriteknik and Hagglunds) which 
built a 400 kW experimental power plant at Lysekil. 
<H5>  Useful for Others </H5>
  "The coordinates for LM Glasfiber's wings belong to them, of 
course, but our increasing knowledge of wing design is something 
that other clients can also benefit from," said Anders Bjorck of 
FFA.
