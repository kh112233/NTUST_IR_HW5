FT  12 DEC 94 / Peace prize talks make no headway
Israeli and PLO leaders yesterday parted in disagreement over the peace
process, after receiving the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for their accord on
Palestinian self-rule, Reuter reports from Oslo.
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and
Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yassir Arafat made no breakthrough
in talks on the terms for much-delayed Palestinian elections - the next
stage in the peace process.
The two sides agreed to intensify high- and middle- level talks on the
critical second stage of the deal - redeployment of Israeli troops away from
Palestinian population centres on the West Bank before Palestinian elections
are held.
Mr Rabin said Israeli security concerns must be dealt with in a balanced
way, warning: 'Short cuts might lead to catastrophe.' Mr Arafat, in his
acceptance speech on Saturday, insisted on the withdrawal of Israeli troops
from Arab towns on the West Bank before elections can be held.
Israeli and PLO officials said their delegations would meet again in Cairo
on Wednesday for further talks.
