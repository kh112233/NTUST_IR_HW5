WIND-PRODUCED ENERGY IS ALREADY SUBSTANTIAL 
James Flanigan's column, "Clean Air Act Will Fuel New Technologies" (Oct. 31), 
about the benefits of the federal clean air legislation is off base on at least 
one point. 
Commercial generation of electricity by wind and solar power will not have to 
wait until the next decade as Flanigan predicts. 
It has been growing steadily in California during the past decade. In 1989, 
wind energy produced 1% of the state's (the world's eighth-largest economy) 
total energy demand for that year, enough to power a city the size of San 
Francisco. 
Commercial generation of electrical energy by wind power began in 1981. Since 
then, turbine performance, energy production and the number of turbines 
continue to grow, despite the lack of tax incentives or government subsidies. 
Los Angeles and Kern counties are recipients of a major portion of this energy. 
During windy days, wind turbines in the Tehachapis produce more than 200 
million watts of electrical power, enough to satisfy demand in the Antelope 
Valley. 
The wind industry is not waiting for clean air legislation as an incentive to 
begin commercial generation. We have been producing electrical energy without 
air pollution for the past decade.
