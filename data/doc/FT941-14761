FT  19 JAN 94 / National curriculum cost total of Pounds 469m
Implementing the national curriculum in England and Wales cost the
government Pounds 469m from its introduction in 1988 until April last year,
it was revealed yesterday.
Since Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment
Authority, started his review last April about Pounds 35m has been spent on
attempting to implement national curriculum tests, which were widely
boycotted by teachers' unions.
Sir Ron has now recommended radical reductions in the curriculum's content.
It is to be cut by 20 per cent up to the age of 14 and virtually abandoned
after that.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said in a written parliamentary
answer that the total cost was Pounds 469m.
This included almost Pounds 100m attributed to the National Curriculum
Council, which devised the curriculum, and to the Schools Examination and
Assessment Council, which devised the tests to assess it.
Most of the planned tests have now been abandoned, and children will only
face compulsory testing on the core subjects of English, mathematics and
science at the ages of seven, 11 and 14.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, claimed this meant that more
than Pounds 500m had been wasted.
She said: 'The Dearing process has been a costly exercise in finding out
what we already knew: that the Tory national curriculum was nothing of the
sort. It was an attempt to impose a national syllabus and has involved waste
on a massive scale.'
The bulk of the expenditure was paid to schools directly in grants for the
general education support programme.
However, these costings do not include any estimate of the cost in terms of
lost teacher time spent filling in 'tick-lists' for pupil assessments rather
than teaching. Sir Ron has urged teachers to 'burn their tick-lists'.
