  [Excerpts] Khartoum, 1 Jun (KNA/PANA) -- Sudan says it is 
considering taking its dispute with Egypt over Hala'ib border 
area to international arbitration, because a bilateral solution 
seems to have failed. 
  In a press briefing Tuesday [31 May], under secretary of the 
Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs 'Umar Baridu said in 
Khartoum that Sudan would either go to the International Court 
of Justice or an international arbitration committee. 
  "We think it is possible to reach a peaceful solution to 
this 
dispute in a cordial and civilized manner through such a 
mechanism", he said. He cited the example of Libya which 
returned the Aouzou strip to Chad after the international court 
ruled in Chad's favor. [passage omitted] 
  Baridu also described as a "clear violation of Sudanese 
supremacy" Egypt's presence in the area of Arqueen [as 
received]. Arqueen is an area claimed by Sudan in the Lake Nasir 
area formed after the construction of the Aswan High Dam in 
upper Egypt in the 1960's. Sudan, suspicious that Egypt wants 
to annex the area thought to be rich in Nile water fish, claims 
that thousands of Egyptian soldiers have been stationed in the 
area to prevent the intrusion of Sudanese fishermen.
