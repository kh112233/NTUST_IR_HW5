DISPARITY IN DISORDERS 
Question: When it comes to eating disorders, I don't see why the patients are 
almost always women and seldom men. What can there possibly be about food that 
would make women more likely to have a problem with it than men? 
Answer: A number of men may undergo strenuous dieting for sports-related 
reasons, but this unusual concern does not bring them to the attention of a 
physician in the same fashion that women would be if they also were extremely 
concerned about their weight. For example, young men who participate in 
wrestling often show a yo-yo pattern of dieting, alternating weight loss with 
weight gain. This can have harmful effects, but the individual involved does 
not seek medical attention. 
Another reason for the apparent disparity in the incidence of eating disorders 
between men and women is that symptoms that may identify women as having an 
eating disorder do not apply to men. For example, cessation of menstruation, 
which helps diagnose an eating disorder in women, cannot be used to diagnose an 
eating disorder in men.
