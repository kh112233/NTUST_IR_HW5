ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; 
HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE DIES IN CAR ACCIDENT 
A Brea-Olinda High School junior and varsity football player was killed 
Wednesday night when his car failed to negotiate a curve on Carbon Canyon Road 
and landed at the base of a 10-foot embankment, police said. 
Brian Arredondo, 17, of Brea had left the home of his girlfriend in the Olinda 
Village area of the city about 11 p.m. Wednesday night and was heading home 
when the accident occurred. The coroner's office and the Brea police are 
investigating. 
"They told us that he was not wearing his seat belt and was thrown from the 
car," said Gordon Biccum, the victim's grandfather. "He was probably killed 
instantly. There were no witnesses, so we are just guessing what happened." 
Family members reported the youth missing about 5 a.m. Thursday morning. Brea 
police found the wreckage of Arredondo's Acura Integra about two hours later. 
Arredondo had moved to Brea with his family from Portland, Ore., about 18 
months ago, Biccum said. 
At Brea-Olinda High School on Thursday, students and teachers mourned the death 
of Arredondo, who played center and linebacker on the varsity football team 
this year and was also a member of the track team. School Principal Gerry Goff 
said psychologists were available throughout the day to talk with students 
about the death of their classmate. 
"He had a lot of friends and supporters," Goff said. "A number of the students 
felt they couldn't stay at school for the rest of the day after hearing the 
news. It's been a sad day for us here." Members of the school's football team 
were called out of their classes into another room and told together about 
their teammate's death. 
"He was really just a great guy," said teammate Mark Hales, who left school 
early after hearing the news. "He lived life to the fullest for the short time 
he had." -- ALLISON SAMUELS
