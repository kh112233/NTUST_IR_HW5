FT  13 DEC 93 / Observer: Getting down to business
Thank you Jacques Attali] If the ex-boss of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development had not enjoyed the good life so much, then
his colleagues at bigger multinational institutions might still be enjoying
one of the best perks of their job - first class air travel.
The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have decided that their
staffs will have to give up flying first class and make do with business
class. To prevent mutiny in the ranks, the executive directors, who
represent member countries, will also be downgraded to business class.
There are, of course, exceptions. The World Bank exempts only its president,
Lewis Preston, who is tall enough to need the extra legroom. At the IMF,
however, Michel Camdessus, the managing director, and his department heads
will still be allowed to travel first class.
So why did they do it? Preston and Camdessus are anxious not to be tarred
with the same brush that swept Attali from office. 'I think they both got
fed up with it being the first subject that came up in any conversation,'
moans one ex-first class flyer.
