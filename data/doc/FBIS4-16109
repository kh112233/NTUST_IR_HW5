  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 12, BNS -- The government intends to 
take stringent measures to put a stop to the rising inflation, 
including forced bankruptcy of companies that are in arrears 
with payments into the state coffers, Prime Minister Mart Laar 
said at a press conference today. 
  The government hopes to curb inflation by reducing the 
amount 
of cash in circulation through calling in debts to the state and 
by promoting privatization and the development of the stock 
market in the country, Laar said. 
  Most debts stem from non-payment of the social and the sick 
benefit taxes, the premier noted. 
  The 8.9-percent rise in inflation last month was primarily 
caused by the local governments' price policy and the jump in 
the amount of cash in circulation which occurred in the last 
quarter of 1993, Laar claimed. 
  The premier voiced the opinion that inflation would have 
been 
between 3 and 4 percent in March if only the price hike in foods 
and manufactured goods were taken into account. 
  According to the Statistics Department, food prices rose 
last 
month by 5.3 percent, and dairy products shot up by as much as 
13.3 percent. 
  If the local governments again put up the rent and public 
transport rates in April, inflation may not stop, Laar said. 
  "At a meeting with World Bank representatives yesterday we 
discussed the problem of inflation and I can say that neither 
the World Bank nor the International Monetary Fund see any cause 
for concern in the rising inflation in Estonia," the premier 
stated. 
  The inflation rate will probably drop in the second half of 
the year, Laar said.
