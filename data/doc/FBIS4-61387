"No Getting Rid of Vast `Collection' of Arms Without Help"] 
  [Text] Minsk -- The National Agency for Control and 
Inspections (NACI) has officially denied reports alleging that 
Belorussia [Belarus] has suspended the elimination of military 
technology under the Treaty on Conventional Arms Reduction in 
Europe. 
  It is thought in the NACI that Belorussia would require at 
least $8 million to fully honor the obligations under the 
treaty. Belorussia's repeated appeals to Western states in this 
regard, however, have elicited no response.
