FT  21 MAR 94 / World News in Brief: Militant Kurds stage violent German
protests
About 6,000 militant Kurds went on the rampage in the southern German town
of Augsburg and on a nearby motorway after authorities barred them from
holding a rally. Protesters commandeered several buses, blocking the
motorway, and poured fuel on the asphalt and set it alight. Other
demonstrators, supporters of the banned Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK),
blocked intersections in Augsburg and threw firebombs, police said. Kurds
also set fire to a train car in Wiesbaden, and held demonstrations in
Berlin. Police said in all about 30 protesters were arrested and 85 police
officers injured. Germany banned the PKK in November, saying its members
used violence.
