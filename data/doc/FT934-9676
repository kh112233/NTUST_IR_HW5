FT  09 NOV 93 / Swedish museum suffers Dollars 60m art theft
IMPORTANT paintings and sculptures by Picasso and Braque were stolen from
the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm on Sunday night in Sweden's biggest
art theft. The museum's curator, Mr Bjorn Springfeldt, valued the works at
more than Dollars 60m (Pounds 40m) but they are so well known that they
could never appear again on the open market.
The thieves climbed through a hole in the roof, without setting off security
alarms. The eight works taken were the most important in the museum, and
included versions of some of Picasso's greatest images, including 'La
Source' of 1921, and 'La Demoiselle' (1929). A bronze sculpture of 1941,
'Femme Boisgeloup', was also stolen. The two paintings by Braque were 'Le
Chateau de La Roche-Guyon' of 1909 and 'La Nappe Blanche', painted in 1928.
Old Master paintings, including a Vermeer, were taken in 1990 from the
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in the greatest art theft of
recent years. They have never resurfaced.
