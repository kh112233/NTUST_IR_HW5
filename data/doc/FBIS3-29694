  [Text] Efforts have been made by various parties to reach 
an understanding through discussions over an incident in which 
Thai fishing boats were fired upon by foreign soldiers who 
claimed that Thai trawlers intruded into Cambodian waters off 
Koh Kong Province. An exchange of gunfire ensued as a result. 
  Commenting on it, Interior Minister General Chawalit 
Yongchaiyut said the shooting was a result of misunderstanding. 
He said the governor of Trat Province is holding a discussion 
with the governor of Koh Kong to settle the problem. Gen. 
Chawalit said he knew nothing about the reported closing of the 
border at Koh Kong. 
  Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said that 
negotiations 
had been held, and he believes the problem will be settled. He 
said the Thai Navy proposed a joint patrol of the area. He said 
he had reported to the prime minister the steps taken on this 
matter. 
  [Begin recording] [Wichit] If there is a channel for talks, 
I believe there will be a settlement on the issue. The Thai 
Navy proposed a joint patrol of the area to prevent future 
incidents. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Have you reported the incident to 
the Cabinet? 
  [Wichit] No, but I have reported to the prime minister about 
the guidelines we have followed to deal with the problem. We 
are coordinating work with the foreign minister and the interior 
minister to settle the problem. I told foreign correspondents a 
while ago that we have received cooperation from the Cambodian 
defense minister, His Excellency Tie Banh. We have already 
discussed the matter with him. [end recording]
