FT  06 NOV 92 / FT wins award for its reporting
THE FINANCIAL TIMES has won the Texaco/Industrial Society Industrial
Journalism of the Year Award, the first time that it has been won by a
publication rather than an individual.
The award judges said the FT was 'enormously strong', and 'in a class of its
own'. They praised the all-round excellence of the FT's reporting and
reporters across a broad range of topics, shown by the success of FT
journalists in the specialist categories of the awards.
Ms Rhiannon Chapman, director of the Industrial Society, said the paper was
'no longer just the thing that all those people who used to wear bowler hats
read on the Tube'.
David Goodhart, labour editor, won the Europe Industrial Journalist of the
Year Award, while reporters Bronwen Maddox, Lisa Wood and Diane Summers all
received commendations in the national newspapers category. John Thornhill,
packaging and retailing writer, was commended in the environment category.
The FT's Pounds 750 prize is being donated to the award scheme which
commemorates David Thomas, the resources editor of the FT who was killed on
an assignment in Kuwait last year.
Channel 4 News won the television programme award for industrial journalism
and BBC Radio 4 won the radio award. Michael Smith, labour editor of The
Observer, won the national newspaper industrial journalist award.
John Authers of the Financial Times has won the Unit Trust National
Journalist Award made by the Unit Trust Association. This is the second year
in succession that the FT has received this award. Paul Nuki of the FT
publication Financial Adviser was awarded the title Technical Journalist of
the Year.
