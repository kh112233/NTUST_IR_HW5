Cabinet of Ministers: "The Ukrainian Economy in January-November 
1993"] 
  [Text] At the end of the year, the economic situation 
in Ukraine remains extremely difficult. The total level of 
output continues to fall, the government budget deficit 
continues to increase and excessive emission of money goes on, 
leading to further deepening of the economic crisis in the 
country. 
<H5>  Implementation of the Budget </H5>
  Revenues of the consolidated budget for the 
January-October period amounted to K26.065 trillion. In 
addition, to cover the projected budget deficit and other 
budgetary expenditures, K8.465 trillion was borrowed from the 
National Bank of Ukraine. 
  Value-added taxes raised K9.212 trillion, taxes on revenues 
(profits) of enterprises and organizations K7.9 trillion, 
indirect taxes K1.132 trillion, individual income taxes K1.099 
trillion, contributions from enterprises and organizations to 
the Fund for the Implementation of Measures to Overcome the 
Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster and for Social Security 
K1.087 trillion and revenues from foreign economic activities 
K960 billion. 
  Expenditures of the consolidated budget during 
January-October amounted to K28.947 trillion, of which K3.957 
trillion (or 13.7 percent of the total) was used for social 
security purposes, K6.423 trillion (22.2 percent) for social and 
cultural purposes and K6.317 trillion (21.8 percent) for the 
economy. 
  In the current year, support for enterprises and entities 
experiencing financial difficulties was effected by means of 
soft loans from the budget. During the first 10 months, K6.638 
trillion of such loans has been issued, including K1.065 
trillion to the Pension Fund and K4.978 trillion to the Ministry 
of the Agricultural Industry. 
  Spending on defense totaled K1.224 trillion, and on law 
enforcement K845 billion. The construction of housing for 
servicemen was funded with proceeds from the sale of military 
equipment, amounting to K86 billion. 
  The consolidated budget deficit totaled K2.882 trillion. 
  The government budget in January-October had 
revenues of K13.954 trillion and outlays of K18.817 trillion. 
<H5>  Lending in the Economy </H5>
  Total assets of Ukrainian banks (loans 
outstanding) at 1 November amounted to K44.8 trillion, including 
K9.9 trillion at the National Bank and K34.9 trillion at 
commercial banks. 
  Assets of affiliates of commercial banks from countries of 
the former USSR totaled K93.9 trillion. 
  In October, loans increased by K6.9 trillion, or 18 percent 
(compared to a K9.1 trillion, or 32 percent, rise in September); 
of these, National Bank loans rose by K2.4 trillion, or 32 
percent (compared to 25 percent in September), and commercial 
bank loans by K4.5 trillion, or 15 percent (33 percent in 
September). The share of commercial bank loans at the start of 
November was 78 percent, vs. 80 percent at 1 October and 56 
percent at the start of the year. 
  Of the total amount of loans at the National Bank, K9.5 
trillion, or 96 percent, were credits provided to Ukrainian 
government to cover its budget deficit and domestic government 
debt. 
  To finance commercial banks, the National Bank 
issued loans totaling K10 trillion since the start of the year, 
97 percent of which went to Ukrayna Bank to cover credit lines. 
During October, the volume of bank financing increased by 10 
percent. 
  Given that interest rates on commercial bank financing were 
240 percent, average interest rates during October were 94 
percent, due to soft credits provided mainly to Ukrayna Bank to 
cover loans to purchasing organizations and enterprises involved 
in processing agricultural products. 
  The average interest rate charged on commercial bank loans 
rose by 13.8 percentage points during October, to 246.3 percent, 
compared to 222.5 percent in September. The highest rate charged 
in October was 770 percent (480 percent in August and 600 
percent in September), while the lowest 2 percent (1 percent and 
5 percent, respectively, in August and September). 
<H5>  Inflationary Processes </H5>
  In the 12 months to November wholesale prices on 
industrial output rose 74 times, including on electric energy 
100 times, on construction materials 92 times, on machinery 79 
times, on petroleum products 73 times, on meat products 66 times 
and on dairy products 63 times. 
  In November, wholesale prices charged by industrial 
enterprises rose 1.3 times compared to the previous month, 
including on electric energy 2.4 times, on building materials 
1.5 times, on light industry products 1.6 times, on wood and 
paper products 1.8 times, on oil and chemical industry products 
1.7 times, on machinery 1.4 times and on food and dairy products 
1.2 times. 
  Agricultural prices rose 40 times in the past 12 
months, including on grain and oilseeds 77 times, on sugar beets 
42 times, on cattle and poultry 38 times, on milk and dairy 
products 39 times and on eggs 63 times. 
  Prices for construction and installation work rose 
in the 12 months to September 26 times, and 16 times from the 
end of last year. 
  It should be noted that the growth of wholesale prices 
charged by industrial enterprises considerably outpaces the 
growth of retail prices. 
  In the first 10 months (December 1992 to October 1993), 
wholesale prices increased 45 times, while prices of consumer 
goods and services rose 37 times. 
<H5>  Situation in Some Economic Sectors </H5>
  Industrial production continues to decline. In 
January-November, the volume of goods production fell 8 percent 
compared to the same period of last year. More than half of all 
enterprises saw their output contract. The output of 128 out of 
146 types of very important products shrank. 
  In the first 11 months, enterprises of the fuel and 
energy sector produced 106.4 million tons of coal, which is 
13.1 percent less than during the same period last year; 3.9 
million tons of oil and liquefied gas, or 5.2 percent less; and 
17.6 billion cubic meters of natural gas, or 8.1 percent less. 
  Coal industry enterprises reached only 77 percent 
of the coal production target for November, and 85 percent of 
the target for coke production. Since the start of the year, 
these targets were fulfilled by only 86 percent and 88 percent, 
respectively. 
  The situation in the petroleum processing industry 
remains difficult. Output in basic oil refining continues to 
decline. Since the start of the year, 22 million tons has been 
refined, 38.6 percent below last year's levels. As a result, the 
production of gasoline fell 34.3 percent, of diesel 23.8 percent 
and of heavy fuel 39.5 percent. 
  Electric energy production also continues to 
shrink. During January-November, 207 billion kilowatt hours was 
produced, 8.2 percent less than last year; of these, combustion 
plants produced 128 billion kilowatt hours, or 16.1 percent 
less. The fall in output at combustion plants was in part made 
up by the rise in output at nuclear and hydroelectric plants, by 
4.2 percent and 45.9 percent, respectively, compared to last 
year. 
  The situation with supplying fuel to combustion plants is 
extremely difficult. Gas deliveries during November were nearly 
halved from last year, falling short of target by 456 million 
cubic meters; only 24,000 tons of heavy fuel was provided, 
amounting to just 24 percent of the target. 
  Severe shortages of fuel, energy and raw materials, as well 
as price increases on them, have created a critical situation in 
the metal industry. Some enterprises have been 
working below capacity or have halted production altogether. Due 
to the fall of natural gas deliveries, 15 blast furnaces, 20 
open-hearth furnaces and several rolling mills had to be halted. 
The output of main types of products fell by between 18 percent 
and 37 percent in the first 11 months of the year, compared to 
the same period of 1992. The output of pig iron fell 7.4 million 
tons (23 percent), of steel 8.1 million tons (21 percent), of 
rolled products 4.8 million tons (18 percent) and of steel pipe 
1.7 million tons (37 percent). 
  In November, enterprises of the coal industry in Ukraine 
fell 
short by some 200,000 tons in their deliveries of coke to 
metal-processing enterprises, whereas supplies of coke from 
Russia and Kazakhstan were 20 percent below contracted levels in 
the first 11 months, as a result of payment delays. 
  The situation remains difficult also in 
agriculture. The output and state purchases of main 
types of meat and poultry industry products fell due to the 
decline in numbers and yields of cattle and poultry. 
  In January-November, the output of meat fell by 736,300 tons 
slaughterhouse weight, 24 percent less than the same period last 
year, of milk by 1.269 million tons, or 10 percent less, and 
eggs by 1.254 billion, or 18 percent less. 
  State purchases amounted to 2.216 million tons of meat, or 
24 
percent less than last year, 10.05 million tons of milk (9 
percent less) and 4.704 billion eggs (16 percent less). 
  State purchasing contracts for meat and poultry were only 78 
percent filled, for milk 95 percent and for eggs 81 percent. 
  The government continues to purchase farm products. It 
purchased 14.2 million tons of grain (97 percent of target), 
which is 3.2 million tons more than in 1992. It purchased 
716,100 tons of potatoes (21 percent below last year's levels), 
1.5 million tons of vegetables (5 percent below) and 448,700 
tons of fruit (3 percent above). 
  Due to the decline of total output, lack of fuel and higher 
prices for energy, the volume freight transportation 
continues to decline. In the first 11 months, motor transport 
hauled 418 million tons of freight, which is 37 percent below 
levels of the same period last year; rail transport 496 million 
tons, or 28 percent below; and water transport 27 million tons, 
or 22 percent below. 
  Steady price increases in travel caused further 
reductions in its volume. Airline travel fell 72 percent and 
motor travel 22 percent. 
  At 1 November, 2,167 joint ventures existed in 
Ukraine, producing K887.4 billion worth of goods or services in 
the first nine months of the year. At the domestic market, they 
sold output worth R1.1856 trillion and $131.3 million. Exports 
by joint ventures totaled $201.4 million and imports $262.8 
million. 
  Foreign trade with countries of far abroad totaled 
in January-October $3.5785 billion, of which exports accounted 
for $2.1618 billion and imports for $1.4167 billion. 
  Foreign trade by Ukraine enterprises was conducted with 99 
countries. The highest volumes of exports went to Austria, 
Bulgaria, India, Italy, China, the Netherlands and Germany. Most 
imports came from Austria, Brazil, Germany, the US, Hungary and 
France. 
  The volume of foreign trade between Ukraine and 
countries of the former USSR totaled K34.3 trillion, of which 
exports were K11.2 trillion and imports K23.1 trillion; this 
created a deficit of K11.9 trillion (due to the purchases of 
natural gas, oil and oil products, polyethelene, wood pulp, 
cotton and synthetic rubber). Deficit was registered with Russia 
(K9.7 trillion) and Turkmenistan (K2.1 trillion), as well as 
with Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania and Estonia. 
<H5>  Consumer goods and services </H5>
  The output of consumer goods fell by K8.7 
trillion, or 15 percent, in January-November, and totaled K50.3 
trillion in retail prices. 
  The output of food products fell 11 percent, 
including that of sausage 33 percent, of margarine 32 percent, 
of whole milk 31 percent, of meat 27 percent, of vegetable oil 
13 percent and of cheeses 11 percent. 
  Food industry enterprises suffer from persisting financial 
problems, especially the disarray in inter-enterprise payments. 
Because they are owed money by retail trade organizations for 
sold output, and experience a liquidity shortage, food industry 
enterprises have been unable to pay in full for the deliveries 
of agricultural products. They can get no loans for these 
purposes. 
  The output of non-food products fell 23 percent 
during January-November, and totaled K16 trillion. 
  The output of cultural-recreational and household good fell 
considerably. For instance, the output of tape recorders 
declined 27.3 percent, of television sets 25.4 percent, of 
electric irons 16.4 percent, of automatic laundry machines 13.2 
percent, of radio sets 11.8 percent and of refrigerators by 7.8 
percent. 
  One cause of this is the shortage of rubles to pay Russian 
enterprises for raw materials and components, as well as delays 
with payment processing in the banking system. 
  The energy crisis in the country also impacts negatively on 
output. 
  The main cause of the existing situation is the lack of 
foreign currency, including rubles, which is needed to buy up to 
70 percent of required raw materials outside Ukraine, as well as 
shortages of domestic currency. 
  The volume of retail trade fell by 28.2 percent in 
constant prices in the first 11 months of the year compared to 
the same period of last year, and totaled K28.1 trillion. 
  Due to constant price increases on practically all consumer 
products, the situation in the consumer market worsened further 
during January-November. Consumers are trying to get rid of 
their money as soon as possible, since it is rapidly losing 
value, while the available goods are clearly insufficient to 
meet demand. As a result, retail trade inventories are 
declining. At 1 December, stocks covered 41 days of sales, 6 
days less than a year ago. 
  In January-October, the sale of meat through state and 
cooperative retail trade fell 19.4 percent, of butter 10.4 
percent, of vegetable oil 17.7 percent, of cheese 36.4 percent 
and of eggs 25.5 percent. 
  Average monthly wages for employees in the state 
sector rose 15.8 times since the start of the year, amounting to 
K240,200 in October. They are lowest in the catering industry, 
culture and the arts, social work, agriculture, retail trade, 
housing, education and health care, ranging from K149,000 to 
K197,000.
