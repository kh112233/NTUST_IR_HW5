NATION IN BRIEF; 
WASHINGTON, D.C.; 
STUDIES FAVOR EARLIER USE OF AIDS DRUG 
People who take the AIDS-treatment drug AZT before symptoms of the disease 
appear may be less likely to develop resistance to the drug than those who 
start AZT when they get sick, researchers from Burroughs Wellcome Co., the 
maker of the drug, told the Food and Drug Administration's newly formed 
Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee. The researchers said new studies indicate 
people who receive AZT before they become ill have far fewer drug-resistant 
strains of the AIDS virus than patients who start after signs of acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome appear. AZT is the only government-approved drug to 
directly attack the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus.
