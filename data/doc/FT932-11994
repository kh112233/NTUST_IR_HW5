FT  30 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Thatcher ready for Iraq arms
inquiry
BARONESS Thatcher has indicated to the Scott inquiry on arms sales to Iraq
that she will respond positively to the call for her to give evidence.
The former prime minister's appearance could prove the most dramatic part
the hearings planned by Lord Justice Scott. The date on which she will give
evidence - almost certain to be in public - has yet to be finalised but it
is unlikely to be until later this summer.
Much of the inquiry, set up last year, relates to the time when Baroness
Thatcher was in office. The investigation centres on Matrix Churchill, the
Coventry-based machine-tool company alleged to have supplied parts for
Iraq's so-called supergun.
When Lord Justice Scott announced earlier this month that he was calling the
prime minister and his predecessor, Mr John Major was quick to indicate that
he would give evidence
Many Tory MPs believe the inquiry will vindicate present ministers. Some go
further, arguing privately that, with Mr Major increasingly distancing
himself from his predecessor, he may benefit if the previous administration
is discredited. A date has not been set for Mr Major to appear.
If Baroness Thatcher had refused to appear the inquiry team may have asked
the government for powers to force witnesses to attend.
Lord Justice Scott has been in informal contact with Baroness Thatcher's
office and she has indicated to him her willingness to co-operate. But she
has not formally been invited to give evidence and will not respond
officially until she is.
Interrogation of witnesses starts on Tuesday with Sir Richard Luce, the
former Foreign Office minister. Lord Justice Scott hopes to publish his
report before the end of the year.
