FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Spectrum counter sues Sculley
Spectrum Information Technologies has filed a counter-suit against Mr John
Sculley, who has resigned as chairman and chief executive only four months
after joining the company. The company is seeking over Dollars 300m in
damages.
In the lawsuit, filed in Connecticut late yesterday, the company counters Mr
Sculley's claims that he was deliberately misled concerning the company's
accounting and legal problems. Mr Sculley, former chairman and chief
executive of Apple Computer, said he would not have joined Spectrum had he
known it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On Monday, Mr Sculley filed a suit against Mr Peter Caserta, Spectrum
president.
Spectrum claims, however, that Mr Sculley was fully aware of the SEC
investigation and of its accounting practices before joining the company.
'The explanation Sculley provided for his resignation is false,' the suit
states, 'as his own 'due diligence' file, which he left at Spectrum's
offices after resigning makes clear, Sculley was fully aware of the
accounting issues that he cited as one of the reasons for his departure.'
Spectrum is charging Mr Sculley with breach of contract, breach of fiduciary
duty, mismanagement and theft of trade secrets.
