SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 




I. Background


In the 

Federal Register

 of January 7, 1983 (48 FR 834), FDA published a proposal to affirm that citric acid, dibasic ammonium citrate, calcium
citrate, potassium citrate, sodium citrate, isopropyl citrate, stearyl citrate, and triethyl citrate are GRAS
for use as direct human food ingredients. The proposal was published in accordance with the announced FDA review of
the safety of GRAS and prior-sanctioned food ingredients. 
In accordance with 170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), copies of the scientific literature review and the report of the
Select Committee on GRAS Substances (the Select Committee) on citric acid and these citrate derivatives have been
made available for public review in the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Copies of these documents are
also available for purchase from the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285
Port Royal Rd., Springfield, VA 22161.
The proposal gave interested parties an opportunity to submit comments. Several letters, each containing one or
more comments, were received in response to the proposal. The substantive comments received addressed several points,
among which were additional uses for certain citrates, changes in the description of the manufacturing methods for
other specific citrates, and other technical corrections to the regulations proposed for other specific citrates.

In the 

Federal Register

 of August 20, 1992 (57 FR 37738), FDA published a tentative final rule announcing that it was tentatively affirming
the GRAS status of citric acid and the citrate derivatives named above. In the tentative final rule, the agency responded
to the comments that had been received in response to the proposal. The agency published a tentative final rule before
proceeding to final action because a significant period of time had elapsed since publication of the proposal. In
addition, the agency wished to allow for comment on two provisions in the tentative final rule that were not part of
the original proposal: (1) The inclusion of the changes published in the third supplement to the Food Chemicals Codex,
3d ed., in the specifications for citric acid in new 184.1033(b); and (2) the revised description of isopropyl
citrate in new 184.1386(a) and of stearyl citrate in new 184.1851(a).


II. Response to Comments


Three comments were received in response to the agency's tentative final rule on citric acid and the citrates named
above. None of the comments addressed the provisions in the tentative final rule on which the agency had requested
comments. Two of the comments merely expressed general support for the agency's tentative affirmation of the GRAS
status of citric acid and the above named citrates. One comment reported additional direct food uses for calcium citrate
and requested inclusion of these uses in the final rule. The additional uses, for which the comment provided information
on dietary exposure, were in home-prepared jams and jellies, and in beverages and beverage bases; the technical effects
specified were as an anti-caking and free-flow agent, or as a processing aid. The comment also indicated that calcium
citrate is used as a pH control agent.
In its safety review, the Select Committee had concluded that no evidence in the available information on calcium
citrate demonstrates, or suggests reasonable grounds to suspect, a hazard to the public at levels that are now current
or might reasonably be expected in the future. In the proposal, the agency stated that it had undertaken its own review
of the available information on calcium citrate and concurred in the conclusion of the Select Committee (48 FR 834
at 836). The agency has considered the requested additional uses of this ingredient and finds that the additional
amounts consumed would not be large enough to change that conclusion and that sufficient safety data exist to affirm
the uses as GRAS when the ingredient is used in accordance with current good manufacturing practice. The agency also
concludes that the ingredient will perform the technical effects specified.
The agency concludes that a large margin of safety exists for current and reasonably expected future uses of calcium
citrate in food. In light of this large margin of safety, the agency finds that inclusion of all of the food categories
and technical effects in which calcium citrate is used, or in which its use was requested, would result in a regulation
for calcium citrate that would be unnecessarily long. Therefore, the agency is no longer including a list of technical
effects nor a list of food categories in new 184.1195(c). 


III. Scope of the Rule


FDA is amending the current regulations by removing 21 CFR 182.1033, 182.1195, 182.1625, 182.1751, 182.1911, 182.6033,
182.6195, 182.6386, 182.6511, 182.6625, 182.6751, 182.6851, and 182.8195. The agency is adding new 21 CFR 184.1033,
184.1140, 184.1195, 184.1386, 184.1625, 184.1751, 184.1851, and 184.1911.


IV. Environmental Impact


The agency has previously considered the environmental effects of this rule as announced in the proposed rule that
published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 7, 1983 (48 FR 834). No new information or comments have been received that would affect the agency's previous
determination that there is no significant impact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statement
is not required.


V. Economic Impact


FDA has examined the economic implications of this rule, which affirms that citric acid, dibasic ammonium citrate,
calcium citrate, potassium citrate, sodium citrate, isopropyl citrate, stearyl citrate, and triethyl citrate
are GRAS for use as direct human food ingredients, under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(Pub. L. 96354). Executive Order 12866 directs Federal agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available
regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits
(including potential economic and environmental benefits, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts
and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
The agency finds that this rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. Because
no current activity is prohibited by this rule, the compliance cost to firms is zero. Because no increase in the health
risks faced by consumers will result from this final rule, total costs are also zero. Potential benefits include the
possible wider use of these substances to achieve intended technical effects and any resources saved by reducing
the need to prepare further petitions to affirm the GRAS status of certain of these substances. In accordance with
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, FDA has also determined that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small businesses.
