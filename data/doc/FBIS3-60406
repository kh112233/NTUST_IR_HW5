  [Text] Beijing, December 18 (XINHUA) -- A new kind of 
medicine for treating iron-deficiency anemia has been developed 
by a health care products factory in Zhanjiang City in south 
China's Guangdong Province. 
  Nearly 1,000 clinical tests showed that the drug was 98 
percent effective. 
  The medicine, "Weixue Chongji," which is taken mixed with 
boiling water, is made from traditional Chinese medicine 
ingredients. 
  It is said to be more easily absorbed and to have no 
side-effects on the stomach or intestines, making it an 
improvement on medicine made from ferrous sulfate that 
iron-deficiency anemia patients in China use at present, said 
medical experts at a symposium on women and health care held 
here. 
  Iron-deficiency anemia is a disease with high incidence 
worldwide, said the experts. In China, the incidence of this 
disease is about 40 percent among children and 20 percent among 
women.
