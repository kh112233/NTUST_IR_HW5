FT  26 OCT 94 / Survey of Technology in the Office (6): Lack of discipline a
potential disaster - Control of office software needs to be returned to
computing professionals
Staff at entertainment group Polygram International must either use
Wordperfect and Lotus 1-2-3 or be denied access to company networks and even
face a reprimand.
This is the company's way of dealing with an issue which is increasingly
gaining attention as organisations seek to adjust the balance between
end-user software freedom and the central control of standards, contracts,
support and costs.
Office computing is now 'generally out of control', says Robin Bloor, head
of the research firm Butlerbloor, who has just produced a report* on
corporate strategy for office systems. He identifies some reasons.
First, traditional computing departments do not understand office computing
and are not used to supporting distributed systems. Meanwhile, business
departments often include PC enthusiasts who think they know more than they
do and interfere with attempts to introduce controls.
As business users gain budgetary and operational independence from the
computing department, control of computing resources becomes a political
issue.
A new type of conflict is therefore emerging between computing departments
and their end-users. In the past, business people complained that requests
for new software took months to be dealt with. PCs running spreadsheet
software gave them a taste of freedom but the falling cost of software
packages and growing familiarity with PCs mean they are now moving on to
buying and illegally copying software products which are not supported or
approved of by the central computing unit.
'In some offices we have seen a lack of discipline which almost beggars
belief,' Mr Bloor says. 'The horror stories include no back-up, virus
infestations, the spread of illicitly copied games, a complete lack of
training, undeclared and unaudited software development, not to mention the
purchase of non-standard hardware and software.'
Such findings support claims by the Federation Against Software Theft that
half the office software used in the UK is illegally copied. This costs jobs
in the software industry and stifles innovation by cutting development
budgets, the federation says. More than half the software piracy is by
end-users who do not realise they are doing anything wrong.
Other research suggests that lack of training means that only 5 or 10 per
cent of the facilities of office software products are exploited.
Studies of spreadsheet software users have shown that they are in fact
programmers without programming training: one survey by accountancy and
consultancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand found that 90 per cent of spreadsheets
had errors of more than 5 per cent in their results.
Action is needed because, as Mr Bloor puts it, 'the end-user is truly in the
ascendancy'. The office PC is now used for most writing and calculating;
soon it will be the standard for all data storage and communication too, he
says.
Growth of workgroup computing and of client-server systems is also
complicating both local office systems and corporate applications which
combine local and central processing and data storage.
'A major problem is that few organisations have defined sensible boundaries
and responsibilities,' Mr Bloor says. 'It requires senior management
intervention to exert control where it has been lost; it also requires the
formulation of appropriate corporate standards for both user departments and
computing departments to apply.'
He believes the computing department must concede control and ownership of
office systems to the users. 'What is needed is a partnership between users
and the computing department which allows users' enthusiasm and energy to be
capitalised on and properly channelled.'
This partnership must give software purchasing back to the centre, Mr Bloor
says. This will not only produce the biggest discounts but also ensure that
there are corporate standards, bringing savings in support and training.
The computing specialists must be allowed to instil the discipline of
software and data back-up and security in end-users and hammer home the
importance of avoiding software piracy.
If users are allowed to develop their own software, using spreadsheets or
the increasing number of apparently (but not really) simple development
products appearing on the market, the computing department must be allowed
the final say on testing and quality.
Such proposals highlight the changing nature of the computing department and
the need to rethink software support, according to Philip Virgo, head of IT
Strategy Services, who produces an annual study of skills trends. He says
companies need to review their computing department structures and
recruitment policies in the light of the 'fundamental change' in the nature
of the computing community.
Growth in the use of office software means that a new computing staff
category - that of user support - has appeared from nowhere in the past five
years.
He believes most growth in employment in computing will be in user support -
and that office software users themselves could fill these jobs.
Mr Virgo says recruitment traditionally involved taking on graduates as
technicians and promoting them to systems analysts. But today's need is
especially for business analysts and user support people.
'Secretarial and admin staff are now often in charge of routine computing in
user departments,' Mr Virgo says.
'Where computing is critical, the staff increasingly report to a user
manager with solid computing experience, typically gained from a posting to
the computer department for a systems project.'
He argues that such trends mean the demand for computing skills, especially
in user support, could be met increasingly by retraining users.
Mr Bloor agrees that office staff are becoming their own software support
specialists: he says more than 80 per cent of end-user support is done
'unofficially' by end-users who are supposed to be doing other jobs.
This work is not budgeted for. As a result, 'the cost of providing support
is out of control in many large companies'.
Mr Bloor, however, tends to feel that support should be the responsibility
of central computing professionals rather than retrained secretaries.
Whatever the finer points here, companies must either promote the
partnerships between user and computing departments that Mr Bloor talks
about or sooner or later face the 'horror stories' he uncovered. For people
will increasingly use information technology to develop their own working
environments, drawing together different pieces of software.
'Ultimately, end-users will all become developers of a kind,' he says. 'The
trouble is, the typical end-user is blissfully unaware of sensible computing
disciplines.'
