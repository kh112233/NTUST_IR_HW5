JUDGE MOVES JUDAS PRIEST TRIAL TO RECORDING STUDIO 
The Judas Priest trial moves from a courtroom to a recording studio today to 
allow a judge to hear for himself whether the heavy metal band's music includes 
the subliminal messages that allegedly drove two young men to suicide. 
Nevada District Judge Jerry Whitehead will convene his court in a Reno studio 
to listen to recordings of the original 24 tracks that were mixed into the 
"Better by You, Better Than Me" on the album "Stained Class." 
Lawyers for the British rock group and CBS Records Inc. say they will also 
present testimony from the album's sound engineer and producer that there were 
no phrases such as "do it" hidden in the song. 
Relatives contend that subliminal messages in the music drove Raymond Belknap, 
18, and James Vance, 20, to their deaths in a 1985 suicide pact. 
Final arguments in the case are expected Wednesday or Thursday. Whitehead has 
indicated he will render a quick decision. 
Kenneth McKenna, a lawyer for the Belknap family, said that he thinks there has 
been adequate evidence that the phrase is concealed in the music and that it 
prompted the young men to shoot themselves with a shotgun after drinking beer, 
smoking marijuana and listening to Judas Priest records for hours. 
Lawyers for Judas Priest and CBS Records deny there is anything hidden in the 
music. 
The trial has become a battle of contradictory testimony from sound and 
computer engineers, psychiatrists and psychologists. 
Lawyers for the families have not indicated how much in damages they will seek. 
Vance lived for three years after the suicide attempt, but his face was badly 
disfigured and hospital bills amounted to more than $400,000. He died in 1988 
of complications from the wound.
