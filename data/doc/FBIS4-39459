  [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev announced 
that in Turkey he would discuss the new Turkish procedure for 
passing through the Black Sea straits of Bosphorus and 
Dardanelles which Ankara intended to enact from July 1. 
  "Turkish officials say they stand for free passage 
established by early conventions. Just some administrative 
measures are to be discussed in order to reduce harm to the 
environment and to rule out clashes," Kozyrev underlined. He 
said it was quite reasonable since every traffic must be in 
order. The main point is that free passage in accordance with 
the convention be preserved. We are ready to cooperate. We 
have all chances to achieve an agreement," Kozyrev concluded.
