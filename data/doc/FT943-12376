FT  26 JUL 94 / Australian transport groups end price case
TNT, the large Australian transport group, and Ansett Transport Industries,
a related company, have withdrawn their defence against a case of alleged
price-fixing brought by the Australian Trade Practices Commission, deciding
that it would be preferable to face a substantial penalty rather than
continue the legal fight.
The TPC is Australia's main competition watchdog, and the case, which was
filed in 1992, centred on an alleged cartel in the express freight business
during the 1980s.
The case had been brought against TNT, Ansett Transport Industries, Mayne
Nickless, another big Australian transport company, plus a number of
individuals, under section 45 (2) of the TPC Act. This prohibits
market-sharing agreements between companies or curbs on the supply of goods
to decrease competition.
Yesterday, Mayne declined to comment on TNT's decision, or to say whether
would follow its fellow defendants' example.
In a statement, TNT and Ansett Transport Industries said the move to
withdraw a defence had been taken 'for purely commercial reasons'.
The case had not been expected to reach a hearing until next year, and this
would have lasted several months.
