<F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: "Warning of Islamic Attacks"] </F>
  [Excerpts] German security services have strengthened their 
protection of Jewish and Israeli facilities in the Federal 
Republic. 
  The reason for this is the massacre of more than 30 Arabs by 
a Jewish settler in Hebron. [passage omitted] 
  The Office for the Protection of the Constitution has 
produced an analysis warning the federation and the laender of a 
"medium to long-term increased risk to security in Germany." 
  The analysis says that "because the terror potential is 
incalculable and arbitrary, attacks by opponents to the 
PLO-Israeli agreement could spread beyond the region at any 
time, possibly to Germany as well." 
  Therefore in Western Europe there is a particular danger of 
"spontaneous actions by fanatical lone-wolves from the Islamic 
region." This also applies to the Federal Republic where, 
according to the experts in the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, violent actions by "irrational individuals" are 
also to be expected in the short term. 
  Jewish and Israeli facilities are considered primary targets 
for such actions. But, says the analysis, the Islamic 
organizations active in Germany, the ones most expected to carry 
out acts of violence, still do not have the necessary 
infrastructure to carry out a rapid and organized strike. 
  According to the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution, there are some 1,640 supporters of the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Democratic Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), and Shi'ite extremist 
Party of God (Hizballah) active in Germany. Just like the 
dissident organizations that oppose the PLO, these groups want 
to revert to an armed struggle with Israel.
