  [Text] During his unofficial visit to Estonia, Lithuanian 
Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius met with his Estonian 
counterpart, Mart Laar, in Tallinn today. 
  After the meeting was over, the Lithuanian premier told 
INTERFAX that the main goal of his visit was to look into 
Estonia's experience in the transition to local sources of fuel. 
He pointed out that his meeting with the Estonian prime 
minister focused on the expansion of bilateral cooperation and 
the preparation for the meeting of the prime ministers of the 
three Baltic states scheduled for January 19 in Jurmala. 
  Slezevicius said that the Latvian and Estonian prime 
ministers intend to put forward the question of extending the 
trilateral agreement on free trade concluded in 1993 over 
agricultural products left outside the scope of the agreement, 
consular protection of the three states' citizens abroad, etc. 
  The Lithuanian prime minister said that during his stay in 
Estonia he examined the weapons the republic purchased from 
Israel. However, he said that Lithuania did not consider 
purchasing arms as the acutest issue leaving it out of the 
agenda. 
  On Wednesday, Slezevicius and Laar will leave for the 
meeting 
of the prime ministers of the Baltic states in Jurmala.
