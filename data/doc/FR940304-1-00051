 

Table 2 presents the maximum reported or calculated EP or TCLP leachate concentrations for the eight TC metals, nickel,
cyanide (EP analysis only), and zinc. Table 3 presents the leachate concentrations obtained from the MEP leachate
analysis performed on the cured stabilized filter cake. 

The detection limits presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3 represent the lowest concentrations quantifiable by BSC when
using the appropriate SW846 or Agency-approved analytical methods to analyze its waste. (Detection limits
may vary according to the waste and waste matrix being analyzed, 

i.e.

, the ``cleanliness'' of waste matrices varies and ``dirty'' waste matrices may cause interferences, thus raising
the detection limits). 

BSC used SW846 Method 1311 (TCLP) to leach, then followed Method 8260 and Method 8270 to quantify the leachable
concentrations of the volatile and semivolatile organic compounds listed in Table 1 of 261.24. Chloroform,
the only detected organic constituent, was found at a maximum concentration of 0.0624 ppm (without blank correction)
in BSC's dewatered (unstabilized) filter cake. Chloroform was also detected at a level of 0.0950 ppm in one of two method
blanks; therefore, its presence in the waste is uncertain and may be attributed to laboratory contamination. 

Last, on the basis of explanations provided by the petitioner, none of the analyzed samples exhibited the characteristics
of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity. See 261.21, 261.22 and 261.23.

1These levels represent the highest concentration of each constituent found in any sample of dewatered (unstabilized)
filter cake, uncured stabilized filter cake and cured stabilized filter cake collected by BSC. The maximum level
of a specific constituent in dewatered filter cake does not necessarily correspond to the maximum level of the constituent
in uncured stabilized filter cake or cured stabilized filter cake. In addition, these levels do not necessarily represent
the specific levels found in one sample. 


2Calculated from the maximum total constituent level in stabilized filter cake samples by assuming a dilution factor
of twenty (based on 100 grams of sample and dilution with 2 liters of TCLP leaching solution) and a theoretical worst-case
leaching of 100 percent.
