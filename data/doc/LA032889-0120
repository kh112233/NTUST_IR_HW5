BRIEFLY 
Amgen Losses Mount: Amgen's chief executive said the Thousand Oaks 
biotechnology company faces losses in the millions of dollars for its fiscal 
year ending this month because of a court ruling that could delay federal 
approval of Amgen's new anti- anemia drug. Gordon M. Binder said the loss would 
not exceed $10 million but that Amgen had expected fourth-quarter sales of the 
drug, called erythropoietin, or EPO, to offset start-up costs. Amgen has been 
sued by its marketing partner, and a federal judge last week ordered Amgen to 
submit more data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which could delay 
FDA approval of the drug.
