10 HURT IN SUBWAY BLAST 
A maintenance crew working in a commuter railroad tunnel below midtown 
Manhattan apparently sliced through a live cable Tuesday, causing an explosion 
and fire that injured 10 workers. The blast, under the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, 
shut down all rail service to and from Grand Central Terminal.
