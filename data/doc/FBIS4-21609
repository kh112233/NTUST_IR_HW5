  [Excerpts] The saga of the Nigerian Boeing, stranded at 
Larnaca Airport for six days loaded with 23 tons of arms, has 
ended well. The arms were transferred from the Boeing to a 
British plane yesterday. Both planes then left Larnaca Airport. 
  The Nigerian plane [as published] arrived in Larnaca from 
Amman yesterday at 1600 and the transfer of arms began around an 
hour later. The transfer was carried out by special forklifts 
sent from Israel and by workers of the company representing the 
Nigerian plane in Cyprus. 
  Larnaca Airport Director Andreas Papathomas told I SIMERINI 
that the airport's management made forklifts and carriages 
available to carry 10 big cases of arms. All the cases were 
covered with black nylon. 
  During the transfer, which took three hours, police took 
very 
strict security measures. Civil Aviation Department Director 
Mikhail Irodhotou was at the airport. The Nigerian plane was 
later given permission to depart on three engines for Tel Aviv, 
where it will be repaired. [passage omitted on background 
information]
