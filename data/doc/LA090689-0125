HONDURAN BILLIONAIRE MATTA GUILTY OF RUNNING CALIFORNIA COCAINE RING 
A Los Angeles jury found Honduran billionaire Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros 
guilty today of operating a California cocaine ring in a decision hailed as a 
powerful message of support for the Colombian government's war on drug 
traffickers. 
"We're sending the right message that we want to send to the Colombian 
government, that if they extradite drug kingpins we will prosecute them to the 
full extent of the law," said the prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Jimmy 
Gurule. 
Matta, 45, was accused of overseeing a network that distributed $72-million 
worth of cocaine in Los Angeles. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
claimed he controlled a narcotics empire worth up to $2 billion. 
The U.S. District Court jury found Matta guilty of one count of conspiracy, one 
count of running a continuing criminal enterprise, one count of possession with 
intent to distribute cocaine and four counts of distribution of cocaine. 
Matta's attorney sought to portray the Honduran as a legitimate businessman who 
was the single largest employer in Honduras before his arrest there in 1988. 
The government argued that Matta was a kingpin of the powerful cocaine cartel 
based in Cali, Colombia, that distributed thousands of kilograms of cocaine to 
Arizona and Southern California through Mexico. 
The charges stemmed from a September, 1981, raid on a Van Nuys apartment 
complex that netted $1.9 million in cash and 114 pounds of cocaine -- at that 
time the largest seizure of the drug in California history.
