SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA; 
CHILD-CARE PROGRAM OKD 
A city-employee child-care program and a $100,000 loan program to operate 
child-care centers in Northwest Pasadena were approved Tuesday by the Board of 
Directors. 
Under the $171,020 Model Employer Program, the city will provide a subsidy to 
low- and moderate-income city employees who need help paying for child care. 
The board approved providing $142,000 to such payments that are expected to 
average about $87 monthly for very low-income city workers. 
The program also provides six months of unpaid maternity leave for city workers 
who could return to a reduced work week of 20 hours. City employees would be 
allowed to take sick leave for family emergencies or to care for a sick child. 
Under the Northwest Child Care Trust Fund, three-year loans at 5% interest 
would be provided to family day-care homes and child-care centers in Northwest 
Pasadena, the city's largest minority neighborhood. 
The model employer program is an effort by the city to set an example and to 
encourage private businesses in Pasadena to set up child-care programs. Only 
Santa Monica and Irvine offer similar subsidies to city employees. 
The Pasadena loan program will begin July 1, but the city's child-care program 
will initially serve only management and non-union employees. Labor unions 
representing about 1,200 of the city's 1,600 workers must agree to the 
child-care program before it goes into effect for unionized employees.
