  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 30, BNS -- The president of the Bank 
of Estonia, Siim Kallas, in his remarks on arrival from a visit 
to the United States and Canada said Estonia could boast being 
increasingly popular among politicians and business leaders on 
the American continent for its quick economic progress. 
  Estonia's achievements in the economic reform are widely 
known and there is permanent interest in learning about the 
factors that have brought about this relative success, he said. 
  Kallas during the past week and a half participated in the 
work of the interim committee of the International Monetary 
Fund. He also attended a conference on the topic of the 
independence of central banks in Eastern Europe. 
  The Bank of Estonia president had a number of meetings with 
business leaders and politicians in New York and Toronto, Canada. 
  Kallas in his comments to BNS today said that even Estonia's 
rapidly increased inflation rates for the past few months had 
not diminished the country's popularity. "Of course, I often had 
to answer to questions on that issue," the head of the central 
bank said. But it still seemed that the inflation rates have 
not affected the country's overall standing, he added. 
  Kallas said that experts at the IMF had no fear at all about 
Estonia's high inflation rates. IMF's main advice to Estonia is 
to be patient, and the inflation wave goes over, he said.
