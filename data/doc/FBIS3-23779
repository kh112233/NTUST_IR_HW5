Economy Must Change"] 
  [Text] Minister of Agriculture Jaan Leetsar believes 
that vast changes must occur in the structure of the Estonian 
economy. 
  At present, agricultural production and the food industry 
account for 33.6 percent of the total structure of production. 
This ratio is not favorable; the proportion of industry should 
be substantially higher. 
  Throughout the world agriculture is subsidized at the 
expense 
of other sectors of production, whereas in Estonia this cannot 
be done. Leetsar believes that in the future agriculture should 
not remain a leader in the area of exports. The volume of 
production in agriculture should increase; however, the growth 
in industry should be substantially higher. 
  Last year exports of agricultural products increased by 
approximately a factor of two, and came to 2.1 billion kroons, 
leaving other sectors of industry behind.
