  [Text] Johannesburg May 24 SAPA -- The SA Police Service 
[SAPS] would hunt down "cowards" who continued to murder 
policemen even though the political climate in South Africa had 
changed considerably, the SAPS said on Tuesday. In a statement, 
the SAPS said 93 policemen had been murdered between January 1 
and May 24 this year. 
  "In spite of the fact that unrest incidents have declined 
drastically, ten policemen have been murdered since (election 
day) April 27 -- an indication that the killing of policemen is 
continuing unabated." 
  Young men and women in their prime, who were there to 
protect 
the lives and property of the community, were often killed for 
no reason other than that they were law enforcement officers. 
  "These attacks will no longer be tolerated. The cowards who 
attack our members must not expect any respite in our efforts to 
hunt them down." Regardless of attacks and murders, and long 
hours of work under difficult circumstances, policemen still 
remained dedicated to their task. 
  "It is therefore the responsibility of the community to 
assist the police and become involved in police-related matters 
so as to ensure a future for all South Africans," the SAPS said.
