Former football star and convicted drug offender Chuck Muncie was sentenced to 
one year in jail for violating the probation he received after pleading guilty 
to failing to file state income tax returns. 
The former Charger running back did not appear in court in San Diego when Judge 
E. Mac Amos Jr. passed sentence and ordered Muncie to pay a $3,000 fine. 
In June 1987, Muncie pleaded guilty to violating the California Revenue and Tax 
Code. Muncie admitted he did not file returns in 1983 and '84 when he had 
income from the Chargers estimated to be $371,000. 
In a plea-bargain agreement, Muncie agreed to file these tax returns, pay a 
$2,000 fine to pay for investigative cost, and pay his back taxes, estimated to 
be more than $20,000 by the Franchise Tax Board. 
Tax Board spokesman Jim Reber said Muncie violated probation because he has yet 
to file for these tax years, and he has not filed any state income tax return 
since 1982. 
Muncie was sentenced Tuesday to 2 1/2 years in federal prison on a cocaine 
possession charge and for lying to a federal judge about his use of the drug 
while free on bail. 
The additional one year will be served concurrently.
