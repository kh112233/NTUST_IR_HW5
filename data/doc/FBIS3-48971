  [Excerpt] Former Pakistani Prime Minister Navaz Sharif, 
who is visiting Bosnia-Herzegovina, held a news conference 
today. Nedzar Leko reports: 
  [Leko] At the beginning of the news conference Navaz Sharif 
explained the purpose of his visit: 
  [Sharif, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian translation] 
"The purpose of my visit to Bosnia is to express solidarity 
with the heroic struggle of the Bosnian people. This is also a 
humanitarian mission, whose aim is to establish the facts. I 
wanted to find out what could be done to lessen the suffering of 
the Bosnians so that I could help the Bosnian cause on the 
political and diplomatic front. 
  "Of course, Bosnia must be given much more attention than 
the 
international community has done so far. The international 
community does not have a clear picture of Bosnia. I am 
referring to a section of the international community, which 
does not support the Bosnian cause in the way it should, not 
even as regards humanitarian aid. The international community 
should be much more active in supporting the Bosnian cause. 
  "We have now seen the situation ourselves. In the past, we 
only heard on television or read in the newspapers that the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is very grave. It is painful to 
see that the Bosnians are compelled to live in a situation such 
as this, while the world is still not doing anything about it." 
  [Leko] In his introductory speech, Navaz Sharif also spoke 
about the double standards of the world, demanding that an end 
be put to it. 
  [Sharif] "While the victims of aggression, the Bosnians, are 
continuing to suffer, the aggressor is neither being halted nor 
punished. Bosnia is not only an Islamic or European issue. 
This is an international humanitarian issue, because crimes are 
here being committed against humanity and human rights are being 
violated. This must be stopped. 
  "We think that the lifting of the arms of embargo is 
something that should be done so that the Bosnians can defend 
themselves. Also, it must be made possible for humanitarian aid, 
food, medicine, and clothing, to arrive in Bosnian unobstructed. 
These are the main things that should be done with regard to 
Bosnia. This task should be undertaken by the United Nations 
and the international community." 
  [Leko] Replying to journalists' questions on the causes of 
the inefficiency of the Organization of Islamic Countries, Navaz 
Sharif said: 
  [Sharif] "It is a pity that not enough is being done. 
Actually, the international community is rather indifferent, and 
I think that the Organization of Islamic Countries must mobilize 
itself more. Pakistan will play an important role with regard 
to demands for the lifting of the arms embargo. It will not be 
enough only to lift to the embargo. A way must be found to 
deliver it [arms] to Bosnia. The prevention of arms deliveries 
to Bosnia is sheer discrimination and we will use diplomatic 
channels to influence those countries that are opposed to the 
lifting of the embargo into changing their view." [passage
