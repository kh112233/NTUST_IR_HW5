FT  23 JUL 92 / Pan Am jury awards Dollars 9m damages
IN THE first of what could be scores of damage trials stemming from the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, a US jury yesterday
awarded Dollars 9.2m (Pounds 4.8m) to the family of a PepsiCo executive,
Reuter reports from New York.
The award, reached after a three-day trial in the Brooklyn federal court,
was less than the Dollars 25.25m sought by the plaintiff's lawyer on behalf
of relatives. The liability portion of the civil suit was won on July 10
with a verdict that Pan Am committed 'wilful misconduct' by failing to
detect a bomb in luggage before the explosion in December 1988.
Individual trials for the 213 plaintiffs have to be held to determine
damages.
