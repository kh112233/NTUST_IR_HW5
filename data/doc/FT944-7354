FT  25 NOV 94 / Further Gaza clashes likely
Further confrontation between the Palestine Liberation Organisation and
Islamic militants is expected today when the militants hold a big rally in
Gaza amid growing evidence that Palestinian police were largely to blame for
last Friday's killing of 12 people. The Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement
has refused formally to sign an accord with the PLO to calm tension in the
Gaza Strip and ban weapons at public rallies until the PLO accepts
responsibility for last week's violence. But PLO efforts to blame the
incident on a conspiracy against the Palestinian self-rule authority are
being widely discredited and there is growing evidence to support the Hamas
version of events. The PLO accused the opposition of provoking violence by
firing on police and said evidence for the claim was supported by the fact
that among the dead were one policeman and eight activists of the Fatah
faction, the PLO's largest political group. Reuters news agency reported
yesterday that no policeman had been killed and only one of the dead was an
active Fatah supporter.
