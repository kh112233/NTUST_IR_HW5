BUSINESSES CONNIVE IN MONEY LAUNDERING, PANEL REPORTS 
Congressional investigators said businesses are routinely conniving with 
customers to circumvent money-laundering laws requiring large cash transactions 
be reported to the Internal Revenue Service. 
"Businesses from across our land are willing to assist others in laundering 
money and evading taxes for a quick buck," said Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.), 
chairman of a House Ways and Means subcommittee. 
Under a 1984 law, businesses are required to report to the IRS all transactions 
that involve more than $10,000 in cash. The purpose was to help the IRS 
identify taxpayers with large cash incomes that might otherwise be 
under-reported. 
However, the subcommittee investigators found that car dealers, jewelers, yacht 
salesmen and others are willing to ignore the law in order to make big cash 
sales. 
"It is shocking that businesses throughout the country are routinely conniving 
with customers to violate the law," Pickle said during a hearing Thursday. 
The subcommittee investigators reported on their visits to 79 businesses 
nationwide.
