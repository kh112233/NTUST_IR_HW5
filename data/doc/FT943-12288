FT  26 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Potential of hydro-power
Sir, Roland Adburgham's review ('MPs back wind farms for Wales', July 21) of
the Welsh affairs committee's report on wind farms in Wales picks up issues
which prompt me to point out that local interest in hydro-power schemes
differs sharply from that in wind. For example, modern hydro schemes are
essentially below ground and so do not visually intrude on the landscape;
their economics are improving to the point where state subsidies are not
needed; and investment is becoming increasingly indigenous.
Furthermore, there is potential for many schemes of a size sufficient to
meet nearby demands. Renewable energy sources are as variable in their
implications as those regarded as conventional.
