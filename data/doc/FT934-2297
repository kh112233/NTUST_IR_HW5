FT  15 DEC 93 / The Russian Elections: Russia set to benefit from loan rule
change
The World Bank has agreed to modify its loan policies in a move that could
open the way to a wave of new lending to Russia and the other states of the
former Soviet Union.
Its executive board yesterday voted to establish a negative pledge clause
waiver allowing Russia to pledge assets such as oil revenues as security for
loans from other lenders.
If no objections are heard by the close of business today, Russia will be
able to move immediately forward with a Dollars 2bn loan from the US
Export-Import Bank for its oil and gas industry.
'This action has the practical effect of allowing an infusion of capital
into Russia at a crucial time in that country's development,' said Mr
Kenneth Brody, Eximbank's president. Uzbekistan will also receive the
waiver.
In Washington, officials said the board meeting had been scheduled for some
time and its timing was not directly linked to the Russian election.
World Bank policy normally requires borrowing countries to sign a negative
pledge waiver, certifying that they will not pledge their assets to any
other lender. This requirement helps to ensure that the World Bank ranks at
the top of the list of creditors to any country and to preserve its credit
rating.
The policy has, however, hampered the flow of capital into Russia since
investors have been uncertain about repayment.
The World Bank had agreed in principle in March to lift the negative pledge
clause, but restricted the circumstances in which it will grant a waiver to
apply principally to the former Communist countries in transition to a
market economy.
The conditions required the implementation of a programme of macro-economic
adjustment, but yesterday the board agreed to accept evidence that a country
was making progress towards a market economy and privatisation.
The waiver will also be granted for only two years, rather than the three
years originally planned.
