FT  13 AUG 94 / Mediterranean Property, a Two-Part Series: From Tuscan
dreams to Spanish mills - Gerald Cadogan looks at three countries where
climate and the way of life continue to appeal
Many Britons have either moved permanently to Italy, France and Spain or
bought holiday homes, and many more would if they could.
ITALY
Tuscany has long been the magnet for Britons, who have concentrated round
Siena and up towards Florence. But Steve Emmett, of agent Brian A. French,
says prices rose so much late in the 1980s that potential buyers moved to
Umbria (equally glorious country), where they also pushed up prices.
The next stage was the Marche on the east coast, easy to reach in summer by
Pescara, Ancona or Rimini airports but accessible only via Rome or Bologna
in winter.
Emmett says buyers now are 'less adventurous'. All want to be near Siena,
even if that means two rooms and a kitchen.
There is no interest in north Tuscany above Lucca - surely an excellent
reason for looking there - but plenty in all ranges in Umbria and for
cheaper houses in the Marche.
People also ask for the Ligurian Riviera and, occasionally, for Bologna
itself (the traditional food capital of Italy).
Suddenly, too, the island of Elba is in demand from both Italians and
foreigners, who must take the ferry from Piombino. Vendors in the Pounds
200,000 to Pounds 400,000 range are often wealthy British people who bought
in the 1950s and 1960s.
French has several farmhouses on Elba in this bracket and, for L566.5m, an
unusual flat in the fort of Portoferraio with terrace views over the town.
On the mainland, there are apartments in newly restored Tuscan farmhouses
between L180m and L450m, while a farm above Lake Trasimene in Umbria is just
L96m, although it needs work.
Grander is a pink, 18th century villa at Citta della Pieve for Pounds
700,000 (having been over Pounds 1m). The agent, Simply Italy, specialises
in north Tuscany and the Marche, with a wide selection of farmhouses and
cottages (and some townhouses).
Water can be a problem in many regions, however. If so, factor it into your
offer. If you are successful, you could have to dig a well or install a tank
to fill from lorries.

FRANCE
Pyrenees Orientales offers best value at the Spanish end of the French
Mediterranean coast, says Sarah Francis of Sifex (which offers a selection).
And now is the time.
The area is popular with Parisians, who buy for retirement and like the
skiing as well as the sea. The Paris property market is improving, which
will pull up local prices in 1995.
A sensible offer now could let you pay 10 per cent below the asking price -
some recompense for the decline in the pound/franc rate since September
1992.
Small village houses start at FFr300,000, while small villas cost around
FFr500,000-FFr800,000 and larger ones with pools around FFr1.2m.
Towards Italy, though, the vendors are usually very rich and can afford to
wait for the price they want. 'The Cote d'Azur is always expensive,' warns
Hilary Katz of Azur International, which has Cannes luxury flats at FFr5.1m
and FFr2.6m.
Agent GAK Williamson, meanwhile, has apartments in new Riviera developments
from FFr365,000 to FFr5.2m (for a penthouse by the Promenade des Anglais in
Nice).
For FFr33m, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley or John Taylor offer the Villa Le Cottage
near the point of Cap Ferrat; it looks similar to the 'cottages' in Newport,
Rhode Island.
Substantial properties inland include the Chateau de Seillans for FFr9.5m
(Hamptons); a bastide at Salernes for FFr2.75m (KFR or Hugo Skillington);
and a farmhouse at Mormoiron for FFr3.9m (KFR or Duval).

SPAIN
Watch that the vendor has not inserted a clause by which the buyer becomes
responsible for all debts and taxes pertaining to a property. While such a
clause is not illegal, you do not want it.
Barry Randal-Williams, Hamptons' associate in the jet-set resort of
Marbella, says the property market in the area has recovered remarkably,
with twice as much business as elsewhere.
Why? Because Jesus Gil y Gil, the dynamic mayor, has cleaned up the town's
fast-fading image.
As a result, almost all the houses that had been on the market for several
years have sold in the past 12 months and stock is now short. For the first
time in four years, building is racing ahead.
When the new houses are ready, probably by this time next year,
Randal-Williams thinks prices may rise. Meanwhile, house-hunters - including
many British and Germans - are having to look inland.
Hamptons has gone into partnership with a firm in the ancient town of Ronda
(which boasts the country's oldest bull ring) to offer properties ranging
from a large hunting estate to a dilapidated mill at Pounds 75,000. All need
work.
Near Loja, Hamptons is selling Jardines de Narvaez, an 1844 house with an
important listed garden, for Pta235m. The same agent has a farm with 15
acres in the hills behind the Puente Romano development near Marbella.
Price: Pounds 975,000.
Near San Pedro, KFR offers Bosque de Mirlos, a 20-year-old villa, for Pounds
1.25m; while a 2,100-acre sporting estate in the oak forests of Andalucia
costs Pounds 3m. It has partridge, rabbit, duck, deer, boar and mouflon, as
well as fishing.
