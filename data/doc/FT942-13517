FT  25 APR 94 / Boost for integrated road/rail haulage
The cost of altering the UK's railway network to accommodate lorry trailers
carried on the back of rail wagons has been seriously overestimated, says a
study published today, Robert Rice writes.
Widening tunnels and station platforms and raising the height of bridges
between the Channel tunnel and Glasgow could cost as little as Pounds 70m,
says the study by the Piggyback Consortium, a public-private-sector
partnership. Most of that would be spent on the route between London and the
Kent coast.
Previous studies by British Rail showed that modification of the rail
network to allow 'piggybacking' of lorry trailers on rail wagons might cost
Pounds 3bn.
Mr Nick Gallop, a spokesman for the consortium which includes Railtrack,
Eurotunnel, P&amp;O and Kent County Council, said the Pounds 3bn figure had been
shown to be out of date.
The study, partially funded by the European Commission, looked at the
potential for piggybacking freight from Scotland, the Irish Republic and
north-west England through the tunnel to the Continent, where piggybacking
of freight is widely used.
It estimates that piggybacking could take up to 400,000 lorry trailers - 10
per cent of current international freight traffic  - off the UK's roads by
the year 2000.
The study has been shown to Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, who
gave it an enthusiastic reception, Mr Gallop said. The government has not
committed any money to the scheme.
