 

(A) For a species that does not breed in the country of export, certification by the Scientific Authority of that country
that the species occurs in the country of export only during the nonbreeding season; 
(B) For a species that breeds in the country of export, scientific assessment (with documentation) of the nesting
ecology of the species. Such an assessment may include the availability of active nest sites and the number of females
or pairs that successfully produce young per year in each area or region of take; and 
(C) For a species that breeds in the country of export, estimation (with documentation) of recent reproductive rates
(number of young produced per egg-laying female or pair per year) or mortality rates; and 

(v) Estimation (with documentation) of annual mortality or loss, including natural mortality and take for subsistence
use, export trade, and domestic trade in each area of take. 

(5) Determination of biologically sustainable use: 

(i) Estimation of the number exported from the country during the past 2 years, and the number of birds removed from
the wild for export, domestic trade, illegal trade, subsistence use, and other purposes (specify) for the country
of export during the past 2 years; 

(ii) The estimated number of birds that will be removed from the wild from each area of take each year for all purposes
(export trade, domestic trade, illegal trade, and subsistence use), including a description of age-classes (nestlings,
fledglings, sub-adults, adults, all classes), when applicable; 

(iii) For the projected take addressed in the management plan, a description of the removal process, including, but
not limited to, locations, time of year, capture methods, means of transport, and pre-export conditioning; 

(iv) Documentation of how each level of take was determined; 

(v) Explanation of infrastructure and law enforcement and monitoring mechanisms that ensure compliance with the
methodology in the management plan and that the species will be removed at a level that ensures sustainable use; and


(vi) Description of future plans to monitor the species in each area or region of take and to determine whether the number
of birds taken has been sustainable. 

(6) A description of incentives for conservation, including a description of how the sustainable use management
plan promotes the value of the species and its habitats by means of environmental education, cooperative efforts
or projects, development of cooperative management units, and/or activities involving local communities. 

(7) Additional factors: 

(i) Description of any captive-propagation programs (private and governmental) for the species carried out in the
country of export; 

(ii) Description of any existing enhancement activities developed for the species, including, but not limited to,
annual banding programs, nest watching/guarding, and nest improvement; and

(iii) Description, including photographs or diagrams, of the shipping methods and enclosures proposed to be used
to transport the exotic birds, including but not limited to feeding and care during transport, densities of birds
in shipping enclosures, and estimated consignment sizes. 

(b) Approval criteria. Upon receiving a sustainable use management plan in accordance with paragraph (a) of this
section, the Director will decide whether or not an exotic bird species should be listed as an approved species for
importation from the country of export, under 15.33. In making this decision, the Director shall consider
in addition to the general criteria in part 13 of this subchapter, all of the following factors for the species: 

(1) Whether the country of export is effectively implementing the Convention, particularly with respect to: 

(i) establishment of a functioning Scientific Authority; 

(ii) the requirements of Article IV of the Convention; 

(iii) remedial measures recommended by the Parties to the Convention with respect to the species, including recommendations
of permanent committees of the Convention; and 

(iv) Article VIII of the Convention, including but not limited to establishment of legislation and infrastructure
necessary to enforce the Convention, and submission of annual reports to the Convention's Secretariat; 

(2) Whether the country of export has developed a scientifically based management plan for the species that: 

(i) provides for the conservation of the species and its habitat(s); 

(ii) includes incentives for conservation; 

(iii) is adequately implemented and enforced; 

(iv) ensures that the use of the species is: 

(A) sustainable; 

(B) maintained throughout its range at a level that is consistent with the species' role in its ecosystem; and 

(C) is well above the level at which the species might become threatened; 

(v) addresses illegal trade, domestic trade, subsistence use, disease, and habitat loss; and 

(vi) ensures that the methods of capture, transport, and maintenance of the species minimize the risk of injury, damage
to health, or inhumane treatment; and 

(3) If the species has a multi-national distribution: 

(i) Whether populations of the species in other countries in which it occurs will not be detrimentally affected by
exports of the species from the country requesting approval; 

(ii) Whether factors affecting conservation of the species, including export from other countries, illegal trade,
domestic use, or subsistence use are regulated throughout the range of the species so that recruitment and/or breeding
stocks of the species will not be detrimentally affected by the proposed export;
