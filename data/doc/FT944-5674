FT  02 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sun block for plants
Israeli scientists have unravelled a sun-protection mechanism in algae which
could offer a new approach to the cultivation of crops in drought-ridden
areas.
The Weizmann Institute of Science studied a salt-water alga that is capable
of thriving in scorching sunlight. Under intense light, the alga produces a
protein, known as CBr, and a carotenoid pigment called zeaxanthin. The
researchers have cloned the gene for the CBr protein using genetic
engineering techniques.
The scientists concluded that the protein binds with the pigment to form a
light protective antenna which diverts excessive light from the sensitive
components of the photosynthetic machinery. The researchers believe it may
be possible to manipulate a similar mechanism in higher plants, including
crops, to enhance their sun resistance.
