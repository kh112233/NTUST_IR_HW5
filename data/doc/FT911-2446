FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (13): An alliance of regional rivals -
Tourism: in a good position to play the role of an usher
SINGAPORE is facing the challenges posed by some of its neighbours in the
tourism industry in an unusual way.
It has developed a two-pronged response to the challenge of regional and
global tourism. It aims to consolidate and further strengthen its own
tourism product while playing its part to market the broader attractions of
its Asean neighbours. The authorities believe this to be in the interests of
the region.
The Singapore Tourist Promotion Board's (STPB) stance is that the true
tourism competition comes not from its neighbours but from other regions of
the world, particularly well-established tourist destinations such as the
Caribbean or the Mediterranean.
The mood of Asean being currently co-operative, the answer comes as no
surprise. The concept of marketing the region as an alternative to the
Caribbean or the Mediterranean has merit.
The appeal of Asean as a region is much greater than any single country. And
yet, diversity is available in a compact geographical area where tourism
infrastructure and ease of air access have improved immensely over the past
five years.
So the city-state does not apply the traditional definition of competition
to its neighbours. Instead, co-operation in developing the region's tourism
potential is at the core of the STPB's tourism strategy - part of its
marketing effort is to assist visitors to Singapore to explore the
attractions of neighbours Malaysia and Indonesia to further vary their
experiences.
Together with its Asean neighbours, the republic is promoting the region's
multifarious attractions through several Visit Asean Year 1992 campaigns.
Economic co-operation is evident in the Growth Triangle where multinationals
in Singapore unwilling to upgrade and automate in the light of higher wages
are steered to Johor, Malaysia, and the Riau islands of Indonesia, whichhave
lower land and labour costs.
Singapore benefits by offering its marketing, management and financial
expertise. The idea of multilateral co-operation was mooted on the basis
that Singapore prospers with, rather than at the expense of, its neighbours.
The republic is in an excellent position to play usher. Last year, visitors
to Malaysia doubled from 3.7m in 1989 to 7m arrivals, of which 65 per cent
came through Singapore.
The republic enjoyed a 20 per cent increase in earnings in 1990 to SDollars
7.6bn or 6 per cent of its gross domestic product. Though he disagrees with
the Caribbean comparison, Johor's chief minister, Mr Tan Sri Muhyiddin
expects more tourism for the Growth Triangle. He is assuming the opening up
of a market in cash-rich vistors from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea on the
back of their strong economies. Based on this assumption, thetriangle
partners are forecasting 22.5m visitors yielding some Dollars 22bn in 1992.
The Asean Tourism Information Centre's preliminary 1990 report on the
industry concluded that the region will continue to be its own best tourism
market as the importance of intra-Asean travel grows and the regional
economies strengthen.
In 1989, the five Asean countries, excluding Brunei, earned Dollars 10.2bn
in tourism with 36.8 per cent of the 16.4m arrivals being intra-Asean
travel. Asean nations experienced 15-30 per cent growth in arrivals in 1990,
which recordedmore than 17m visitors.
Singapore was not spared the sharp worldwide drop in tourist arrivals during
the Gulf War.
Hotel occupancy rates sank as low as 30 per cent before recovering back to
the 70 per cent levels. Special discounts are being offered for the next few
months to attract local and foreign custom.
Even the finance minister, during his budget speech in March, gave some help
to the hotels, restaurants and tourist-related shops adversely affected by
the Gulf War's secondary effects. He reduced the tourism excess rate from
4to 3 per cent for a year to tide them over their difficulties. The STPB
expectsthe industry to pick up soon while others forecast recovery around
the year-end.
Meanwhile, Singapore continues to invest in developing its own tourism
infrastructure and attractions. The Dollars 578m tourism development plan
nearing fruition sees a new generation of tourism attractions coming
onstream.
The heritage attractions include some of the island's oldest buildings
restored to their former glory, such as Raffles Hotel of Somerset Maugham
fame and Alkaff Mansion, a grand getaway house on a hill formerly owned by a
pioneer.
The conservation efforts, which also include Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar,
have played a prominent role as part of urban redevelopment plan in the late
1980s and 1990, the tourism industry having been instrumental in preserving
important parts of Singapore's heritage.
New theme parks such as Haw Par Villa's combination of high-tech heaven and
Chinese-style hell, and the Underwater World at Sentosa, widen fun options.
At the infrastructural level, new resort hotels on Sentosa island diversify
the range of accommodations available in the Lion City. The completion of
the Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre at Suntec City,
a project sponsored by the Who's Who of Hong Kong's business moguls, adds to
the industry's capabilities and underscore Singapore's position as Asia's
leading convention city.
