The simulated version of "The Terry Anderson Story" shown March 10 on "Saturday 
Night With Connie Chung" employed a technique that was entirely out of place 
for the theme -- the plight of the American hostages in captivity. 
The theme is so strong and so heart-rending that any theatrics imposed on this 
story can only be in poor taste. It was a disservice to our hostages to treat 
their story in such melodramatic style. Moreover, the acting was a sham and the 
notion that news can be so manipulated is disgraceful.
