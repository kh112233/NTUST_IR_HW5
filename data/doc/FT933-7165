FT  24 AUG 93 / Argentina accuses UK on US radar sale
ARGENTINA yesterday accused Britain of trying to block the sale of advanced
US tactical radar for its air force, but predicted that the effort by its
former foe would fail, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires.
'The pressure from Britain is there, but we think it is being overcome,' Mr
Fernando Petrella, deputy foreign minister, told a radio interviewer. 'We
hope it will not succeed.'
He was commenting on a report in the daily Clarin which said London was
pressing Washington to ban the sale of advanced radar to equip three dozen
ageing Skyhawk fighter aircraft.
Mr Oscar Camilion, the defence minister, made similar charges in a separate
radio interview, blaming London for what he described as US reluctance to
allow Argentina to purchase the radar together with the aircraft.
'The objections are coming from the US State Department. . . this is
apparently due to British pressure,' he said.
The British embassy in Buenos Aires declined to comment.
Argentina is buying the Skyhawks from the US to replenish its forces,
decimated during the 1982 conflict with Britain over the Falkland islands.
The two countries re-established full diplomatic links in 1990. Mr Douglas
Hurd, UK foreign secretary, visited Buenos Aires in January and his
counterpart Mr Guido di Tella is due in London later this year.
