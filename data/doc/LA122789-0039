BRIDGES FOR IMMIGRANT CHILDREN 
All the passionate discussions about school overcrowding this year have pointed 
out the challenges inherent in educating California's burgeoning immigrant 
population. 
But in spite of the potential for chaos, there are a selected number of schools 
and organizations that are finding ways to make the public education system 
work for immigrant children. 
And now, with the publication of "Bridges," by the nonprofit organization 
California Tomorrow, there is a catalogue that lists the most promising of the 
state's multicultural education programs. 
"Bridges" includes several Los Angeles and Alhambra school programs that offer 
support for children making the transition to American life when they first 
arrive in this country, a model intergroup relations program offered at Irvine 
High School to students, faculty, parents and community members, and immigrant 
parent involvement programs throughout California. They are all programs that 
have proven successful. "Bridges" is a vehicle to spread the word to others who 
might want to emulate what works. 
 Not reinventing the wheel is a smart way to establish a solid educational 
foundation for the children of California's future.
