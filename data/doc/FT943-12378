FT  26 JUL 94 / Asia-Pacific forum opens in harmony
Asia-Pacific nations celebrated the end of the cold war yesterday by
launching the Asean Regional Forum (ARF), a multilateral security group that
includes China, Russia, the US and 15 other members.
Foreign ministers put forward numerous proposals for improving security,
including measures to prevent weapons proliferation, and the establishment
of a regional peacekeeping centre. ARF members are expected to decide which
ideas to implement at their next ministerial meeting in Brunei in 1995.
For alphabetical reasons Vietnam, represented by Mr Nguyen Manh Cam, the
foreign minister, and the US, in the form of Mr Strobe Talbott, deputy
secretary of state, found themselves in adjacent armchairs at the meeting in
a Bangkok hotel.
Several participants remarked on how the end of the cold war had put a stop
to old confrontations but created new uncertainties. 'Many interlocutors
said that five or 10 years ago it wouldn't have been possible to have these
ministers discuss things - and it was in a harmonious way,' said a Canadian
official. 'This was a historic first meeting and got off to a good start,'
said another.
Territorial claims in the South China Sea, the North Korean nuclear crisis
and the problems of Burma and Cambodia were among the issues raised.
Mr Qian Qichen, Chian's foreign minister, sought to allay Asian fears of
Chinese expansionism by reiterating that 'China does not engage in
aggression or expansion, or seek hegemony'.
Mr Roberto Romulo, foreign minister of the Philippines - which, like China
and four other countries, lays claim to islands in the South China Sea -
suggested that the various military garrisons on the atolls of the Spratly
archipelago should communicate through a common radio frequency and play
volleyball with each other to reduce tensions.
