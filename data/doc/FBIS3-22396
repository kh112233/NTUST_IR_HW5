  [Text] Taipei, March 14 (CNA) -- In the face of building 
international pressure to hit Taiwan with sanctions for its 
failure to sufficiently crack down on trade in endangered 
wildlife and wildlife parts, Taiwan on Monday [14 March] 
released the draft of a harsh conservation law. 
  The Council of Agriculture finished the revision of the 
draft 
Wildlife Protection Law, which provides for a jail term of up to 
seven years or a fine of NT [New Taiwan] $2.5 million 
(U.S.$94,700) for those who violate the law. 
  The draft law, which was still being screened at the council 
Sunday afternoon, was sent to the Executive Yuan on Monday and 
will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval on [words 
indistinct]. 
  The rush comes at the same time the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). It is taking 
a serious look at a boycott proposal against Taiwan for its 
alleged "perfunctory" crackdown on the illegal trade of rhino 
horn and tiger bone. 
  More than 100 conservation representatives from 27 countries 
are gathering in Jerusalem for a four-day meeting at which 
Taiwan's wildlife protection efforts are to be discussed. 
  A nine-member Taiwan delegation is attending the meeting as 
an observer, but will not be allowed to attend any discussions. 
  In Taipei, a local conservation group, Green Consumers 
Foundation, denied accusations that Taiwan is a "black hole of 
smuggled animals." 
  "Even if there were a black hole, it was created by CITES's 
own inappropriate membership requirements," a foundation 
official said. "It is unreasonable not to give Taiwan membership 
while asking it to assume the due responsibility of a member." 
  Jay Fong, secretary-general of the foundation, is a member 
of 
the ROC delegation going to Israel. Fang plans to release an 
investigation report on illegal trade of tiger bone and rhino 
horn on the island.
