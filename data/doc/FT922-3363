FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Refocused Amersham at Pounds 21m
AMERSHAM International, the health science group which has refocused its
activities on radioactive products, increased pre-tax profit by 34 per cent
to Pounds 20.7m in the year to March 31.
The previous year's pre-tax figure was reduced from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds
15.5m to provide for the burying of radioactive waste, which has been stored
since dumping at sea was banned in 1983. The provision also knocked Pounds
9.6m off net assets.
Turnover improved to Pounds 273.5m (Pounds 242.4m) and operating profit to
Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 19.7m). Interest costs were cut to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds
4.2m) as net debt came down from Pounds 41.1m to Pounds 700,000 following
the final Pounds 47m of Eastman Kodak's payment for the clinical reagents
division.
Mr Kirk Stevenson, finance director, said the operating profit from clinical
reagents fell from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 6.4m as income switched towards a
royalties stream rather than a divisional contribution.
Ongoing businesses increased profit by 42 per cent to Pounds 23.9m (Pounds
16.8m), after a Pounds 3.3m rise in R and D spending to Pounds 13.7m. The
figures benefited from Pounds 1.9m of exchange rate gains.
Life sciences, which serves academic institutions and the research
departments of pharmaceuticals companies, made by far the biggest profit
contribution of Pounds 20.9m, up 26 per cent, on sales of Pounds 92.7m
(Pounds 80.7m). This partly reflected recovery from a poor fourth quarter of
the previous year.
Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, said there had been substantial growth in
North America and a focus on margins. It was pushing further into the
pharmaceuticals sector.
Healthcare remained the laggard with a profit contribution of only Pounds
100,000 (loss of Pounds 1.8m) on Pounds 83.8m turnover, up 33 per cent. This
included a full year of Medi-Physics, a US radiopharmaceuticals com-pany
which had been brought back into profit in the second half. Price
competition con-tinued to depress the generic market.
Ceretec, a brain imaging product, increased sales from Pounds 10m to Pounds
14m. New products would include Metastron, for prostatic cancer, and Myoview
to trace blood flow through the heart.
The industrial quality and safety assurance division improved its profit
contribution by 24 per cent to Pounds 4.6m on Pounds 36.2m sales.
Earnings per share went up 44 per cent to 23.7p (16.5p). A final dividend of
8.8p makes a total of 12.5p (11.8p).
COMMENT
The newish management at Amersham has gained considerable credit for
refocusing the business and restoring strong earnings growth - hence the 15p
share price rise to 479p. Life science should continue to drive profits
forward, although the most room for improvement clearly lies in healthcare.
Lower interest costs should help offset a further fall in the contribution
from clinical reagents. A pre-tax forecast of Pounds 24m gives a prospective
p/e of more than 17. The share price has virtually doubled since November
1990 as the group has shed some problems and re-established its growth
credentials. There seems little scope for short-term improvement, although
it is still at a small discount to the health and household sector.
