FT  19 JUL 93 / Czechs and Slovaks in border pact
Slovakia and the Czech republic agreed at the weekend to set up joint
patrols along their recently created common border, after talks at a summit
meeting of the 10-nation Central European Initiative, writes Anthony
Robinson in Budapest. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister and Mr
Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, made the move to reduce the flow of
illegal immigrants from eastern Europe who are barred by Bonn's new asylum
laws from entering Germany.
