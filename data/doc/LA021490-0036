MORNING REPORT: ART 
SoHo Heist: Thieves smashed through a SoHo gallery's front door Tuesday in New 
York and snatched $750,000 worth of art works -- including nine oil paintings 
and drawings by leRoy Neiman -- in a lighting-fast pre-dawn heist, police said. 
The burglars broke through glass panels in the double doors at Dyansen Gallery, 
hot-wired an electronic operated steel security gate and made off with the 
artworks in less than five minutes. In addition to the paintings and drawings 
by Neiman, the thieves made off with six other paintings and four sculptures.
