FT  07 FEB 92 / Third world dirty industry advocated
MR Lawrence Summers, the World Bank's chief economist, last night found
himself embroiled in controversy after the leaking of an internal memorandum
part of which advocates the transfer of 'dirty industries' to the third
world.
'Just between you and me, shouldn't the World Bank be encouraging more
migration of the dirty industries to the LDCs?' Mr Summers wrote in a
confidential memo to senior staff dated December 12.
In the memo, Mr Summers says the cost of pollution depends on the loss of
earnings from increased morbidity and mortality. He says the costs are
lowest in the countries with the lowest wages. 'I think the economic logic
behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is
impeccable and we should face up to that.'
'I've always thought that under-populated countries in Africa are vastly
under-polluted, their air quality is probably vastly inefficiently low
compared to Los Angeles or Mexico City.' He suggests that only high unit
transport costs prevent 'welfare enhancing' transfers of solid waste to poor
countries.
In a further passage he says the 'concern over an agent that causes a one in
a million change in the odds of prostrate cancer is obviously going to be
much higher in a country where people survive to get postrate cancer than in
a country where under-5 mortality is 200 per thousand'.
The World Bank last night issued a statement saying Mr Summers' memo does
not represent the bank's views:
'Mr Summers intended his memo to provoke debate and sharpen the analysis in
a forthcoming World Bank report on the prospects of the global economy. Mr
Summers deeply regrets the .. misunderstandings his memo has caused and
apologises for any misconceptions it may have generated ..'
