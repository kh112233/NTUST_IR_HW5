FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: British Bio-technology losses widen to
Pounds 8.8m
British Bio-technology, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday announced
losses of Pounds 8.81m for the six months to October 31, against Pounds
4.72m.
The company blamed the 87 per cent increase on escalating costs of
developing a new generation of anti-cancer and anti-Aids drugs.
Mr James Noble, finance director, said the results were within budget but
warned that further losses were inevitable as the company continued clinical
trials of drugs which would not go on sale for at least three years.
The range of drugs being tested by the company includes new treatments for
cancer, HIV, acute shock and asthma.
Mr Noble claimed most biotechnology companies incur losses while they
develop such drugs, and British Bio-technology was no exception.
The results also included second quarter figures which showed turnover, on
continuing operations, of Pounds 693,000 (Pounds 1.2m). Losses amounted to
Pounds 4.61m (Pounds 1.83m) and losses per share worked through at 12.7p
(5.1p).
Losses are expected to worsen next year with the launch of clinical trials
in the US.
These trials will be conducted by a new subsidiary in Maryland which will
oversee drug development and seek regulatory approval in the US.
'We're moving into the most expensive stage of development and we will need
to raise more money,' Mr Noble said.
The company expects to make a share placing in 1994 and hopes to forge
alliances with large pharmaceutical manufacturers to cover development costs
of its patented drugs.
Turnover for the six months declined from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 2.83m,
mainly reflecting the disposal of British Bio-technology Products, its
research reagent and assays subsidiary, which was sold in July to Techne
Corp of the US.
Interim losses per share widened from 14.3p to 24.3p.
