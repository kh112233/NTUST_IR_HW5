FT  12 OCT 94 / Prize for Rabin, Arafat starts row
The Nobel Peace Prize committee, wracked by its worst dispute in two
decades, has decided to give this year's award to Israeli prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin and PLO leader Yassir Arafat, the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten
reported yesterday, AP reports from Oslo. It said one committee member, Mr
Kaare Kristiansen, a pro-Israeli former government minister, was so angered
by the decision that he plans to resign in protest when the prize is
announced in Oslo on Friday.
The report appeared to break a tradition of secrecy before formal
announcement of the most coveted of the Nobel Prizes. Each award is worth
SKr7m (Pounds 600,000) this year. Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin gave an impetus to
Middle East peace with a handshake on the White House lawn on September 13
1993. They then signed a declaration of principles on limited Palestinian
self-rule as a first step toward an overall peace settlement.
Aftenposten said the five-member committee struggled with its decision at a
meeting last Friday over who should be honoured for achieving last year's
Middle East peace breakthrough during secret talks in Norway. The newspaper
said the committee might meet again in an attempt to patch up the dispute.
The committee can change its mind until the last minute, but Aftenposten
said this was unlikely as most members wanted Mr Arafat to share the prize.
Aftenposten said Mr Kristiansen had opposed Mr Arafat throughout the
selection process. He refused to confirm or deny the selection or his threat
to resign.
