FT  02 OCT 92 / Czechoslovak opposition votes down break-up
THE Czechoslovak federal parliament yesterday rejected a governmental
proposal for a constitutional break-up of the federation into two republics,
dashing political hopes that the divorce between Czechs and Slovaks would be
fast and clean.
The bill, which set out four legal alternatives for dissolving the federal
state, was blocked by opposition parties seeking a referendum on the
decision.
The rejection highlights the lack of political consensus behind the
post-electoral agreements reached by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime
minister, and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart. The leaders had
agreed to dissolve the federal state by January 1, 1993. They said they
would favour a parliamentary declaration ending the federation rather than a
referendum, the outcome of which is far from certain. Recent opinion polls
show both Czechs and Slovaks equally divided on the issue.
But opposition parties, feeling neglected in the negotiating process,
yesterday refused to lend their votes to reach the three-fifths majority
needed to adopt a constitutional law.
The ruling parties and the opposition will now have to work out a difficult
compromise, which could possibly consist of a parliamentary declaration to
be ratified in a referendum.
Difficult negotiations also lie ahead on the division of federal properties.
While Czechs would like to split the assets based on the territory on which
they stand, Slovaks have called for financial settlements in cases, such as
the military infrastructure, where most properties are in the Czech lands.
