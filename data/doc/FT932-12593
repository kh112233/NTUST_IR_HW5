FT  28 APR 93 / China, Taiwan take steps to end enmity
CHINA and Taiwan exchanged handshakes, pleasantries and a few barbed
criticisms of each other as they met in Singapore for the highest-level
contact between the two in more than 40 years of enmity.
'We have made good progress and look for better things to come,' said Mr
Wang Daohan, leader of the Beijing delegation. The talks, which conclude
today, are described as unofficial, but it is clear both Beijing and Taipei
see this meeting as an important step towards improving relations across the
Taiwan straits.
The two sides have apparently agreed to open a formal channel of
communication - the first such move since the foundation of the People's
Republic of China in 1949 and the removal of the Kuomintang forces of
Generalissimo Chiang Kai Chek to Taiwan. Mr Wang said discussions on
economic issues would be held soon.
There was also agreement on fishing disputes and on fighting piracy in the
region. But suspicion and mutual distrust was evident. Mr Koo Chen Fu,
leader of Taiwan's delegation, said the Beijing side had tried to raise the
question of opening direct trade, shipping and air links with Taiwan. Taiwan
is against any such direct links until China recognises Taiwan. Taiwan is
also frustrated by China's refusal to offer any legal framework for
protection of large-scale Taiwanese investments.
