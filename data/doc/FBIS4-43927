  [Text] Paris, June 23 (AFP) -- French troops were flown to 
the borders of Rwanda and Zaire overnight at the start of a 
UN-mandated mercy mission to protect thousands of minority 
Tutsis, military officials said Thursday [23 June]. 
  France said that 8,000 Tutsis were surrounded by 
Hutu-dominated government troops in southwestern Rwanda. 
  The officials said none of the French soldiers had yet 
crossed into Rwanda, where up to 500,000 people, mostly ethnic 
Tutsis have been killed in an ethnic carnage unleashed by the 
death of the president of Rwanda, a Hutu, in an unexplained 
plane crash on April 6.
