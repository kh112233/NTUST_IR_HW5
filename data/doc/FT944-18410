FT  04 OCT 94 / Judges reject power line plea
The government is not obliged to adopt special precautions under European
law to safeguard children from exposure to possible health risks from new
underground power cables, two High Court judges ruled yesterday.
Three children from London, acting through their fathers, applied for court
orders requiring Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to
fulfil his duty to protect the public and direct National Grid to ensure
that electromagnetic fields from new cables do not exceed levels which
latest research suggests are safe.
The children live in South Woodford, where National Grid is laying a
high-voltage underground cable. Their parents fear dangerous electromagnetic
fields could increase the risk of childhood leukaemia and other cancers.
Their lawyers argued that changes in European law required member states to
act on 'precautionary' principles when carrying out legal duties. But Lord
Justice Farquharson and Mrs Justice Smith refused their application for
judicial review.
The parents are considering an appeal to the Court of Appeal and then, if
still unsuccessful, taking their case to the European Court of Justice.
