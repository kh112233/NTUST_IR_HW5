  [Text] An agreement on a bilateral tourism cooperation 
plan between the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] and the 
Tourism Authority of Thailand [TAT] was signed at the Sheraton 
Grand Laguna Beach Resort Hotel in Phukhet Province yesterday. 
  Regarding the cooperation plan, TAT Governor Thammanun 
Prachuapmo said that it will deal mostly with what Thailand will 
give to Laos, especially in the area of cooperation to prevent 
adverse affects from tourism -- which Thailand has experienced 
-- from occuring in Laos. 
  Phonsouk Khounasombat, director of the National Tourism 
Organization of the LPDR, reported that tourism in Laos has 
gradually expanded since the time the country introduced an open 
door policy to tourism in 1989. In the process, more 
conveniences have been provided for tourists. In particular, 
laws and rules and regulations have been revised to benefit 
visitors more than before. Four more international border 
checkpoints have been opened. They are the checkpoints 
bordering China in Bokeo and Boten; the Souvan checkpoint 
linking Thailand's Mukdahan Province; and the Savannakhet border 
checkpoint linking Vietnam. Moreover, new regulations have been 
made to make it possible for tourists to receive visas either at 
the airport or at an international border checkpoint.
