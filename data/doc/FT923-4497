FT  07 SEP 92 / Cuba's nuclear plant shelved
CUBA'S President Fidel Castro said at the weekend his government was
suspending indefinitely the construction of Cuba's first nuclear power plant
because it could not afford to complete it, Reuter reports from Havana. The
project was the latest casualty of Cuba's current economic crisis, triggered
by the collapse of preferential trade links with east Europe. Havana was
unable to accept Russia's conditions to help complete the project near
Cienfuegos.
