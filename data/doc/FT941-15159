FT  17 JAN 94 / Business Travel: Fares for 'Le Shuttle' - Travel Update
The cost of taking a car through the tunnel under the English Channel will
range from Pounds 220 to Pounds 310.
Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French company operating the service, plans to carry
its first fare-paying passengers on May 8, after the official opening by the
Queen and President Mitterrand.
The journey will take 30 minutes, compared with nearly an hour by hovercraft
and about 80 minutes by ferry. With the tunnel fares at airline levels,
competition promises to be tough: Channel Ferry operator Stena Sealink last
week announced fare cuts under a complete overhaul of its tariff structure.
Eurotunnel can afford to start dear: in the early months it will have
limited shuttle capacity and may be unable to meet demand. But as deliveries
of the special rolling stock to carry cars, coaches and trucks through the
32-mile tunnel build up and the frequency of shuttle departures increases
from two to four an hour, analysts think they may forced to reduce fares to
fill the spaces.
