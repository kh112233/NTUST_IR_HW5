FT  13 JAN 93 / Angolan fighting claims 400
AS MANY as 400 people may have been killed in fighting with Mr Jonas
Savimbi's Unita movement as the rebel leader's troops prepared a mercenary
invasion from neighbouring Zaire, Angolan state radio reported yesterday,
Reuter reports from Luanda.
Fighting spread to the oil-producing northern Zaire province and there were
reports that government planes bombed Mr Savimbi's headquarters in central
Huambo. Unita said that many civilians have been killed in the government
offensive.
Officials in Luanda insisted yesterday that Mr Savimbi, who has fought the
MPLA government for most of the past 18 years, had been driven from his
headquarters in Huambo.
State radio said Mr Savimbi had left Angola and was planning a
mercenary-backed invasion of Angola from Zaire. Zaire has denied the report.
Angolan state radio said Unita was preparing to attack the Soyo oilfields.
The radio said Unita had also destroyed five oil wells owned by Fina Oil, at
Picotas about 12 miles from Soyo.
The radio said Unita troops had massed at the Manga Grande, Quelo, and Sumba
communes to mount a large-scale attack into Zaire Province and said lorries
coming from the Republic of Zaire with weapons and mercenaries.
The radio said Unita troops were also gathering near Menongue, the capital
of Angola's southern Cuando-Cubango province and were preparing to attack
the city.
