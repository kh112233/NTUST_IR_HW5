BRAIN-DEAD GIRL, 15, TAKEN OFF LIFE-SUPPORT AFTER GIVING BIRTH 
A brain-dead teen-ager was removed from life-support equipment Friday, two days 
after giving birth to a premature daughter. 
Tanya Marie Rivera, 15, had been kept on life-support systems after county 
officials rejected the initial pleas of her parents not to do so. 
She died at 12:58 p.m. at San Bernardino County Medical Center, while her 
2-day-old daughter remained in very critical condition with lung problems, 
according to a hospital statement. 
"The parents of Tanya Rivera met with administrators and physicians responsible 
for her care and it was jointly decided that continuing to keep Tanya on 
life-support would serve no purpose," the statement said. 
The teen-ager was declared brain dead March 15 after she suffered a gunshot 
wound to the head, which police say was inflicted by her 16-year-old boyfriend, 
a reputed gang member who is believed to be the newborn's father. 
No charges have been filed against the boy, who is in jail in Los Angeles on an 
unrelated murder charge.
