 

(1) An upper reservoir with a surface area of 199 acres 
created by two compacted rock fill dams and an asphaltic 
concrete or geomembrane liner. The northern dam would be 
178 feet high and have a crest length of 1,910 feet; the 
southern dam would be 100 feet high and have a crest length 
of 2,520 feet. The gross volume of the upper reservoir 
would be 15,990 acre-feet. The water surface would 
fluctuate 123 vertical feet on a weekly cycle. (2) A lower 
reservoir with a surface area of 405 acres created by an 
earth zoned embankment having an average height of 49 feet, 
a maximum height of 57 feet, and a length of 9,690 feet. 
The volume of the lower reservoir would be 18,646 acre-feet, 
and the water surface would fluctuate 44 vertical feet. (3) A 
4-mile long single circuit 500-Kv overhead transmission line 
would lie within a 180 foot wide corridor from the 
substation to the existing Captain Jack substation on the 
California-Oregon transmission line. (4) Overground water 
supply lines 20 inches and 8 inches in diameter and 13,900 
feet long and 2,900 feet long, respectively; (5) A 50-
gallons-per-minute (gpm) water treatment facility. (6) 
Service roads. (7) Underground features including a 
powerhouse with 4 pump-turbines with a nominal rated 
capacity of 250 megawatts (MW) each, a 3,200 foot long 24-
foot diameter concrete-lined power tunnel and 1,326 foot 
long, 24-foot diameter concrete lined power shaft.
