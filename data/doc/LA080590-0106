SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
The San Diego district of the Immigration and Naturalization Service on Friday 
reported cracking an alien-smuggling operation based in two East San Diego 
houses. 
Nine members of the smuggling ring and 16 suspected illegal aliens were 
arrested, INS officials said. 
INS officers entered houses in the 200 block of South 36th Street and the 3000 
block of Imperial Avenue at 4 p.m. Friday to make the arrests, officials said. 
The houses served as staging areas for multinational illegal aliens waiting to 
be transported to Los Angeles and then to final destinations across the 
country, officials said. 
INS agents and San Diego police also pulled over a vehicle northbound on 
Interstate 5 near Del Mar Heights that they said contained two principal 
members of the smuggling ring and an illegal alien. 
The illegal immigrants paid large fees to the smugglers for guaranteed passage 
to their destinations, officials said. 
INS agents infiltrated the smuggling operation several months ago, officials 
said.
