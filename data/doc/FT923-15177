FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: VW forecasts first-half gain as
sales buck trend
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's largest car manufacturer, estimated that first-half
group earnings would be 'slightly higher' than the DM433m (Dollars 274m)
earned in the same period of 1991. Mr Carl Hahn, chairman, said 1.8m
vehicles were sold in the six months, a rise of 5.4 per cent, based on
preliminary figures. Turnover was estimated at DM44bn.
Addressing the annual meeting for the last time before handing over at the
end of this year to Mr Ferdinand Piech, Mr Hahn said VW was on course to
sell 3.5m vehicles worldwide this year compared with 3.1m last year.
This was all the more noteworthy as sales in Germany had fallen by 1.3 per
cent in the first half because of weaker demand in the east.
Mr Hahn contrasted VW's results with those of most US and Japanese
carmakers, calculating that group earnings last year, adjusted for special
depreciation, were 3.7 per cent before taxes which were matched by few
others.
Sales this year will be boosted by the inclusion for the first time of
Skoda, in which VW has a majority stake. Sales of the Czechoslovak car were
expected to rise to 190,000 units from a low point of 110,000 last year.
Skoda was hit by plummeting domestic demand and a collapse of its east
European market but has since found new markets in the west with VW's help.
A Volkswagen spokesman said that with the help of the impending North
American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), VW aimed to boost sales of its cars
in the US by an additional 100,000 cars in coming years. This was the
rationale behind a planned doubling of the capacity of its Mexican operation
to 400,000 units.
