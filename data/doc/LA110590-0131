CRASH KILLS IRVINE MAN, WIFE HURT 
A 33-year-old man was killed and his wife injured when their car left a curving 
street in a quiet residential neighborhood and crashed into a large stone 
pillar, police said today. 
Irvine resident Ioannis (John) Doukas, was pronounced dead at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana shortly after the Sunday night accident. 
The cause of death was listed as severe body trauma. He was not wearing a seat 
belt. 
His wife, Debbie Doukas, 31, who was wearing a seat belt, was in stable 
condition today at UCI Medical Center with upper-body injuries, said Irvine 
Police Sgt. Dick Bowman. 
Bowman said Ioannis Doukas was driving his Chrysler New Yorker around a curve 
on Stonecreek North at the intersection of Willowbrook when he apparently lost 
control of the vehicle, which went over the sidewalk and struck a tree and 
stone fencepost in front of a nearby residence. 
Investigators were at the scene this morning in the residential village of 
Woodbridge to determine the estimated speed of the vehicle and how it careened 
out of control.
