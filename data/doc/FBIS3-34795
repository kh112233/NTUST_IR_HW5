  [Text] Nairobi, Feb 14 (AFP) -- Sudanese rebels said Monday 
[14 February] that 281 people had been killed or wounded in a 
government offensive against the southern town of Mundri, near 
the border with Zaire. UN and relief officials said more than 
100,000 Sudanese were fleeing a major onslaught by government 
warplanes and troops against rebel-held territory in the 
drought-hit south. 
  The offensive could be the final push by Khartoum's Islamic 
fundamentalist military government to end the decades-old 
rebellion in the black and largely Christian south, diplomats 
and aid workers said. 
  The aid workers said a government ban on relief flights to 
southern areas along the Ugandan border had disrupted food 
supplies to about 200,000 displaced people living on aid. The 
UN has appealed for funds to continue relief operations in the 
south, where agriculture, already thrown into chaos by the civil 
war, has also been hit by a severe drought. 
  The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) said that 
"more than 281 civilians were killed or wounded" in the 
bombardment and bombing of Mundri, in Western Equatoria province. 
  There was no independent confirmation as most aid workers 
left Mundri last week when government forces closed in on rebels 
defending the town. 
  In a statement released here Monday, one of the two rival 
SPLA factions said it had repelled the government offensive and 
the army was retreating northwards from Mundri. A spokesman for 
John Garang's mainstream faction said the rebels had killed 67 
government soldiers, but the claim was also unconfirmed. 
  The SPLA splintered into two factions in 1991, and the 
government has since taken advantage of the rebels' internal 
divisions to drive them out of most of the southern garrison 
towns which they had captured.
