FT  29 MAR 93 / Lend to private sector, bank told: The IADB meeting in
Hamburg
A HIGH-LEVEL group established to advise the InterAmerican Development Bank
on how to strengthen the private sector in Latin America has recommended
that the bank lend money directly to private concerns.
There are growing worries that without a shift in bank policy it might be
impossible to obtain finance for infrastructure projects, which many Latin
governments - after a wave of privatisation - are now relying on the private
sector to build. The World Bank and the IADB are both forbidden from lending
without government guarantee.
The group's report, put before the IADB board of governors at the weekend,
recommended 5-10 per cent of the bank's lending could be directed to helping
finance private infrastructure, without government guarantees. Limited sums
might also be lent to private-sector intermediaries financing small
businesses.
The Bush administration in the US last year said the bank should consider
lending to the private sector, and the idea is favoured by Chile, Argentina
and now Mexico, which previously opposed it. However, European government
shareholders were lukewarm.
The group's report also recommended radical restructuring of the
InterAmerican Investment Corporation, the offshoot of the bank which lends
to and makes equity investment in private projects. The corporation has been
given 'a mission impossible' and its current structure was 'no longer
viable'. However, it should continue as a separate entity, the report said.
The Bush administration suggested the IIC should be merged with the bank.
Ecuador's finance minister, Mr Mario Ribadeneira, met the country's main
bank creditors, led by Lloyds of Britain, in negotiations over a debt relief
package. Negotiations are expected today over Brazil's debt restructuring
and tomorrow over Poland's.
