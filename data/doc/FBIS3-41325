  [Text] Quito, 16 Feb (EFE) -- Ecuadoran police have 
discovered an alleged plan of the Colombian "Medellin Cartel" to 
establish a branch in Guayaquil, Ecuador's second largest city, 
from where it was going to distribute drugs to the United States 
and Europe, local media reported today, Wednesday. 
  According to the source, the arrest of Colombian drug 
trafficker Jorge Andrade Caliz during "Operation Victory" a few 
days ago allowed Ecuadoran police to discover the plan. Andrade 
Caliz, who is linked to the "Medellin Cartel," had 372 kilos of 
cocaine when he was arrested. 
  The Ecuadoran Drug Police also arrested Colombians Morlan 
Marulanda Mejia and Victoria Eugenia Hurtado and Ecuadoreans 
Telmo Iturralde Merchan and Cecilia Navarrete Munoz.
