POT FARMS SHOW DRUG TRAFFICKERS GOING HIGH-TECH 
It was like stumbling onto the master villain's secret hide-out in a movie. 
At a solitary ranch house in the high desert 10 days ago, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies and federal drug agents found an incredible sight: thousands 
of marijuana plants lining a huge, high-tech subterranean bunker beneath an 
outdoor basketball court. 
The underground farm near Lancaster was one of three in California and two in 
Arizona discovered over the past three weeks that investigators say are linked 
to a multimillion-dollar marijuana production ring, a major and previously 
unknown supplier of marijuana in Southern California. 
One Drug Enforcement Administration agent called the combined haul from the 
farms "the largest indoor seizure in the history of DEA." 
In the latest find, narcotics investigators announced Friday that they had 
discovered a marijuana farm under construction near Barstow that is believed to 
be part of the Antelope Valley and Arizona operations. No drugs were found at 
that farm, investigators said. 
These cases provide dramatic evidence of a recent geographic and technological 
shift in marijuana production, experts say. 
A slowdown in outdoor pot production caused by aggressive law enforcement 
activity and other factors has literally driven many growers underground, 
experts say. Growers are relocating indoors, some of them moving to isolated 
desert areas such as the Antelope Valley, and to the San Gabriel Valley, said 
Capt. Larry Waldie, commander of the Sheriff's Department narcotics unit. 
But adversity has bred prosperity: sophisticated cultivation equipment makes 
indoor growing much more lucrative than outdoor growing, producing a 
top-potency drug and four harvests a year as opposed to one, experts said. 
So far this year, law enforcement agencies have raided 1,923 growing sites 
statewide, 243 of them indoors, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Charles 
Stowell said. Although the indoor raids are just a fraction of the total, 
authorities say they reflect a continuing increase. There were fewer than 100 
indoor busts during roughly the same period just four years ago. 
"We have created this monster called 'the indoor grow,' " said Stowell, 
coordinator of anti-marijuana efforts in the state. 
Twelve people have been arrested in the Antelope Valley-Arizona case, including 
a Lancaster contractor alleged to have run the tightly organized network with 
corporate efficiency. 
During the course of the investigation, authorities have confiscated 23,000 
marijuana plants worth $77 million. 
They estimate the potential yield of the four functioning farms at a staggering 
46 tons a year, all of it destined for the Southern California market, Stowell 
said. He said about 87 tons had been seized so far this year in California. 
The alleged ringleaders escaped detection for two years by setting up shop in 
sparsely populated, remote desert areas, the longtime haven for criminal gangs 
that manufacture methamphetamine and PCP in clandestine labs, authorities said. 
The farm near Lancaster, which cost about $1 million to build and was capable 
of producing at least $75 million a year in profits, was designed for maximum 
secrecy. It had a surveillance camera, bales of hay positioned to mask the 
aroma of the drug and a thick concrete roof designed to foil infrared 
surveillance devices that detect heat from plant lights. 
Until the late 1980s, marijuana farming was largely the province of Northern 
California producers, authorities said. While some growers stayed in Northern 
California, moving their operations indoors, others headed south. 
The largest previous indoor seizure took place in June, 1989, when 8,000 plants 
were found at a farm near Sacramento. 
"Until last week, Southern California was never perceived as a major growing 
area," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley, head of the district 
attorney's Lancaster office. 
In addition to the Lancaster farm owned by 28-year-old Richard F. Yerger, 
investigators raided a smaller, newer farm 20 miles away in the tiny foothill 
community of Llano. The second house was owned by Yerger's father, 60-year-old 
contractor Richard E. Yerger, and appeared built exclusively to conceal the 
underground plantation. The unfinished farm outside Barstow was about 80 miles 
northeast of the Antelope Valley. 
The younger Yerger surrendered to authorities along with Frank Gegax, a 
48-year-old contractor described by Cooley as the "brains" and financier of the 
operation. Both are charged with possession, cultivation for sale and 
maintaining a place for production of marijuana. Two alleged "caretakers" are 
also charged with possession and cultivation. All four are to be arraigned 
Tuesday. 
A lawyer for Yerger said he believes his client is innocent. Neither Gegax, who 
is in federal custody, nor his attorney could be reached for comment. Yerger 
and the other two suspects are being held at the Los Angeles County Jail. 
Investigators are seeking additional suspects, including the elder Yerger. 
They are also piecing together a picture of an enterprise one deputy described 
as a "marijuana empire." 
Like the Arizona farms, the Lancaster farm operated for at least two years, 
with the younger Yerger acting as front man for Gegax, authorities said. Gegax 
and the Yergers had the means and ability to build the clandestine sites, 
Cooley said, and they selected an area populated chiefly by Joshua trees and 
junk heaps. 
"You almost had to have a four-wheel vehicle to get down the dirt road to the 
house" on Avenue E, Capt. Waldie said. 
All of the farms involved used water tanks, wells, and diesel generators 
intended to keep down electric bills that could draw suspicion. 
Enormous amounts of power were needed for hundreds of grow lights valued at 
$500 each. The Arizona farms used 10,000 kilowatts of electricity a month each, 
compared to 900 per month used by the average home, Stowell said. 
Gegax allegedly had separate "managers" who designed and oversaw each 
operation, Stowell said. The Llano and Arizona farms used hydroponic growing 
equipment and a fully automated irrigation system that only required checking 
every couple of days. 
"You get the right mixture of chemicals and then you can go out and play golf," 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald Smalstig. 
On the other hand, the caretakers at the Avenue E farm had to water plants kept 
in black plastic planters and regulate lighting daily. After harvesting, the 
growers used hooks on the ceiling of the garage-sized building over the bunker 
to hang bales of drying marijuana. The last harvest took place about a month 
before the raid, deputies said. 
The finished product was machine-packaged in one-pound plastic freezer bags and 
placed in cartons. Two people could do the bulk of the work from start to 
finish, Waldie said. 
Investigators are focusing on how the ring distributed to wholesalers around 
the county and on the background of the suspects, who maintained the appearance 
of legitimate businessmen and did not appear to be violent. The alleged 
profiles of Gegax and the others show that criminals of all types -- from 
"Mom-and-Pop outfits to cartels," one agent said -- are involved in marijuana 
trafficking. 
"These were smart businessman types as opposed to violent street types," said 
DEA Group Supervisor John Albano. "High-level drug entrepreneurs." 
Acquaintances describe Gegax as a well-dressed plumbing contractor with a 
confidence bordering on cockiness. Federal authorities say he had a previous 
brush with the law, an arrest in 1973 in the San Diego area for smuggling 
marijuana by airplane, but they have not yet determined how the case was 
resolved. 
They said neither Gegax nor the Yergers -- who worked together in the elder 
Yerger's construction business -- were well-known in the community. 
Gegax worked with the Yergers, according to authorities and competitors, on a 
240-unit senior citizen housing complex in a Lancaster redevelopment area. A 
$4-million fire destroyed the unfinished complex in November, 1987. Arson 
investigators suspect that the fire was intentionally set, but have made no 
arrests. The investigation may resume as a result of the marijuana bust, 
authorities said. 
The fire and ensuing litigation hurt the Yergers financially, according to 
Richard F. Yerger's brother-in-law, Alfred Brand. 
"They were essentially shut down," Brand said. "They didn't have any money." 
The drug case has generated excitement in the Antelope Valley, where drug 
trafficking is usually associated with scruffy bikers or street gangs from 
"down below," as locals refer to the rest of Los Angeles County. More raids, 
arrests and plot twists are expected. 
"Everybody in town is talking about it," said Lancaster Councilman Arnie Rodio, 
who said he met Gegax once at a political fund-raiser. "They're making a lot of 
jokes about basements."
