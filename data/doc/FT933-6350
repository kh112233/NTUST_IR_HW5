FT  28 AUG 93 / World News in Brief: China may reconsider exile of dissident
China may reconsider the exile of dissident Han Dongfang if he shows 'signs
of repentence and mending his ways', the Ministry of Public Security said.
Han founded China's first independent labour union and was jailed for 22
months without trial after the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
