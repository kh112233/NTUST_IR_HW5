FUNGUS MAY BE A CAUSE OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE; 
HEALTH: TWO RESEARCHERS SAY PROOF WILL BE DIFFICULT, BUT COULD CONSTITUTE 'A 
MAJOR DISCOVERY.' 
At least some cases of Parkinson's disease, a devastating neurological illness 
that affects as many as 500,000 Americans, may be caused by infection by a 
common soil fungus, researchers from UC Davis will report today. 
Infection of laboratory animals with the fungus, called Nocardia asteroides, 
damages the specific areas of the brain involved in Parkinson's disease and 
produces symptoms identical to those found in human patients, the researchers 
will tell a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in Anaheim. 
"It's not going to be easy to prove this (that Nocardia causes Parkinson's in 
humans), and there are going to be large numbers of skeptics," said 
microbiologist Blaine L. Beaman of UC Davis. "It certainly seems unbelievable, 
but if we can prove it, it translates into a major discovery." 
Pinpointing a cause of Parkinson's would be of tremendous significance because 
scientists currently do not know what causes the disease. Furthermore, 
identifying a cause, particularly an infectious agent, should lead to new ways 
of preventing the disease, such as immunization against the microorganism. 
Nocardia is widespread in the environment and most people are probably 
routinely exposed to it, either in the air or through cuts. It normally causes 
transient flu-like symptoms, such as cough and fever, but it has been observed 
to cause neurological symptoms in humans, and in some susceptible individuals 
may actually trigger Parkinson's, according to Beaman. 
Other Parkinson's researchers were cautious in their assessment of the 
scientists' results, primarily because no one had seen the study. But "their 
finding is intriguing," said neuroscientist Debra Mash of the National 
Parkinson's Foundation. "It fits in with what we already know. There are a lot 
of things that cause Parkinson's, and most of us agree that it is something in 
the environment." 
"That's an astounding assertion," said neurologist J. William Langston of the 
California Parkinson's Foundation in San Jose, who himself discovered that a 
contaminant formed in the production of the street drug methamphetamine can 
cause Parkinson's. "It would be absolutely fascinating if it is proved to have 
some basis." 
Parkinson's disease primarily affects people over 55. Its main symptoms are 
incapacitating tremors and rigidity of the limbs. As many as 30% of the victims 
also suffer dementia, a form of mental impairment. 
The disorder results from the death of brain cells that produce the 
neurotransmitter dopamine, a brain hormone that is particularly important in 
the control of muscle movement. Symptoms can be alleviated, at least in the 
early stages, with the drug L-dopa, which is converted into dopamine in the 
brain. 
Physicians are also experimenting with transplanting dopamine-secreting cells 
into the brains of Parkinson's victims, but those results, while promising, are 
still considered inconclusive. 
Researchers have never been able to identify the cause of Parkinson's, however, 
and that mystery is a source of considerable study. Their best lead in the past 
was Langston's discovery that a chemical called MPTP, which contaminates some 
batches of illicit methamphetamine, causes a Parkinson's-like disease in young 
people who use the drug. 
At least 400 cases of Parkinson's disease caused by MPTP are known, and 
researchers routinely use the chemical to induce Parkinson's in experimental 
animals. Many researchers believe that environmental chemicals with a structure 
similar to MPTP may cause the disease. 
Some pesticides, for example, have similar structures. But no one has ever been 
able to prove the association. 
A report to Congress by the Office of Technology Assessment on Wednesday, in 
fact, argued that the government is not doing enough to control the release 
into the environment of chemicals that may have the potential to cause both 
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. The report called for an additional $1.5 
million for study of the neurotoxic effects of such chemicals. 
Although many researchers have suggested that infections might also be a cause 
of Parkinson's, most researchers discount that possibility because of a lack of 
supporting evidence. No one has ever been able to isolate an infectious agent, 
such as a virus or bacterium, from the brain of a Parkinson's victim, and no 
one has observed any residual traces of the inflammation that would be expected 
to accompany an infection. 
But Beaman and his colleague, microbiologist Shunro Kohbata, who is on 
sabbatical at Davis from Gifu University in Japan, believe they have found an 
explanation for the lack of such evidence. "Nocardia does unique things that 
other bacteria do not do," Beaman said. 
When Beaman and Kohbata infused large quantities of Nocardia into the blood of 
research animals, the animals suffered widespread inflammation and the few that 
survived showed a variety of neurological symptoms. 
But when they infused much smaller doses, they found that the microorganism 
infected the brain without any inflammatory response -- not surprising because 
immune cells cannot enter the brain unless there is a breach of the blood-brain 
barrier that shields the brain from potentially toxic chemicals in blood. 
In the brain, the Nocardia infection was self-limiting, Beaman said, and it was 
cleared within two weeks. Only after all traces of the infection were gone did 
the neurological symptoms develop. "If we didn't follow the course of events 
carefully, we would never be able to detect the organism," he said. 
According to Beaman, about 15% of the several hundred animals studied in his 
experiments developed symptoms that included rigidity on one side of the body 
(hemiparesis) and head shaking. These symptoms were alleviated with L-dopa. 
Langston cautioned, however, that hemiparesis is not one of the major symptoms 
of Parkinson's, which "raises some doubts" about their discovery. 
Although Nocardia seems to produce no major health effects in most people, it 
causes a much more serious infection in people whose immune systems are 
suppressed, such as by AIDS, organ transplants or cancer. In those patients, it 
can cause serious brain damage or be lethal. 
As support for their theory, Beaman and Kohbata noted that many people with 
severe Nocardia infections have been seen to develop a variety of neurological 
symptoms, including those of Parkinson's disease. Even less serious Nocardia 
infections might trigger such symptoms in genetically susceptible people, they 
speculated. 
Beaman plans to begin looking for traces of Nocardia infection, such as 
antibodies against it, in Parkinson's victims, but he acknowledges that a long 
road lies ahead. 
"There may be many etiologies for Parkinson's. There probably are. Nocardia may 
be one of them, but it will require a lot of work to find out."
