FT  24 AUG 94 / UN push to get Rwandans home
The UN hopes to mount its biggest-ever human rights operation in an attempt
to persuade millions of Rwandan refugees to return home, Frances Williams
reports from Geneva.
Despite appalling conditions in the overcrowded camps in neighbouring Zaire
and elsewhere along Rwanda's borders, the 2.1m mainly Hutu refugees have so
far been reluctant to go back to Rwanda for fear of reprisals from the
Tutsi-dominated Rwandese Patriotic Front government.
Under a proposal by Mr Rene Degni-Segui, special UN human rights rapporteur
for Rwanda, which has been accepted in principle by the RPF government, up
to 200 human rights monitors would be deployed throughout Rwanda to ensure
there were no such reprisals, and to help investigate the massacres of some
500,000 civilians, mainly Tutsi, by supporters of the former Hutu-led
administration.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, has asked the committee of
legal experts charged with collecting evidence on violations of
international humanitarian law to report their findings by the end of
October. This could be followed by a UN decision to set up an international
tribunal to try the guilty.
In his second report on human rights violations in Rwanda released
yesterday, Mr Degni-Segui expressed concern that Radio Television Libre des
Mille Collines, operated by the former Rwandan government, was still urging
Hutus to leave Rwanda and was threatening reprisals against those who
returned. Only about 100,000 refugees have so far gone back. Apart from
those outside Rwanda, 1m-2m people remain displaced within the country.
