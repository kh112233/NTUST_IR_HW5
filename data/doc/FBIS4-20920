Ankara"] 
  [Text] Ankara--It has been reported that Turkey continues 
to be concerned about Russia's intention to violate the 
Conventional Forces in Europe [CFE] Treaty. Russia's deployment 
of troops in the Caucasus, particularly over the past three 
months, has made Ankara uneasy. Turkey has reportedly cautioned 
its allies several times about the presence of Russian troops in 
the region, who are violating the CFE limits on the presence of 
military units in the southern region. 
  Officials who have been closely following Russia's efforts 
to 
revise the CFE limits in the southern region say that Russia's 
military buildup in the northern Caucasus and its moves to 
strengthen its military presence in Georgia and Armenia have 
caused concern. The officials said: "Russia's military 
presence in the Caucasus will significantly exceed the CFE 
limits if the present trend is allowed to continue." 
  Meanwhile, Georgia and Armenia, who have allowed Russia to 
establish military bases on their territory, reportedly have 
been cautioned both bilaterally and multilaterally on the 
problems they may confront if their military presence exceeds 
the CFE limits. Stressing that Georgia and Armenia must view the 
presence of Russian forces on their territory within the 
framework of the CFE limits on their own military forces, the 
officials said: "That means that Georgia and Armenia will have 
to reduce their own military forces, which would have a negative 
impact on their independence and sovereignty."
