FT  29 MAY 93 / Menem calls for Falklands inquiry
ARGENTINE President Carlos Menem has ordered an 'immediate' investigation
into war crimes allegedly committed by British troops during the 1982
Falklands War.
His announcement follows fresh allegations of atrocities made this week in
the UK media. Mr Menem promised that, if Argentine defence ministry
investigators found proof of atrocities, 'we are ready to formally take the
issue to the United Nations, the European Community and the Organisation of
American States.'
Mr Menem's announcement marks a shift in Argentine policy. The government,
particularly the army, had ignored claims made by Argentine troops shortly
after the war about atrocities committed by British soldiers.
Officials subsequently played down allegations of war crimes first made in
1991 by British ex-servicemen.
Former British troops have said in books and in media interviews that they
saw troops execute Argentine prisoners after the Battle of Mount Longdon,
one of the bloodiest of the 45-day war.
Meanwhile, an Argentine defence ministry official said yesterday that his
department began an inquiry of its own last year, in reaction to British
investigations, but said it 'did not get very far.'
The ministry asked Argentine witnesses to come forward with evidence of
atrocities, but received only a few calls from ex-combatants, one of whom
claimed to have been shot at close range after the Battle of Mount Longdon.
Most of the investigations have been carried out by Britain's ministry of
defence and crown prosecution service. Negotiations are under way to allow a
visit to Argentina by Scotland Yard detectives to question ex-combatants.
