FT  02 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs condemn bomb attack in Belfast
THE first of two bomb attacks in Belfast city centre yesterday was condemned
in the Commons as 'vile and reprehensible'.
Mr Seamus Mallon of the SDLP attacked the terrorists who planted the device
in a travel agency, which injured 27 people. A second bomb exploded later.
He said: 'The violence we saw in my constituency at the weekend and which
ripped Belfast apart today is something which is vile and reprehensible and
which cannot be allowed to exist in any civilised society.'
He urged Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, to ask the prime minister
'to ensure when there is a new Taoiseach in the Republic of Ireland, that
they both jointly will lead the drive for peace and a peaceful settlement in
Ireland in 1993'.
