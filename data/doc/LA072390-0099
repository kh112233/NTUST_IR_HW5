IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION 
DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK. 
Credit Card Firms Win Round: A federal judge handed a victory Monday to Visa 
and MasterCard by temporarily barring 19 telemarketing defendants from 
laundering credit card sales drafts or indicating that they are authorized to 
accept Visa or MasterCard charges. U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie in Los 
Angeles issued the preliminary injunction in a suit by Visa International 
Service Assn. and MasterCard International Inc. The fraud suit alleges that 21 
defendants, including telemarketing firms in several states, operated "boiler 
room" telephone operations in which they obtained consumers' credit card 
numbers, then submitted orders for unauthorized charges or failed to deliver 
ordered merchandise. (Filed July 23, 1990. Case No. 90-3388)
