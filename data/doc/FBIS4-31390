  [Text] Zagreb, June 8 (AFP) -- A Canadian soldier with the 
UN forces has died in an apparent suicide, the UN Protection 
Force [UNPROFOR] said Wednesday. Private Kirk David Cooper, 25, 
from North Bay, Ontario, was at an observation post near the 
village of Kasic in southern Croatia on Monday "when it appears 
he decided to take his own life," the UN statement said. It 
said "an investigation is ongoing," adding that "it is not known 
what may have caused Private Cooper to take his own life." 
Cooper, who is the ninth Canadian peacekeeper to die in the 
former Yugoslavia since Canada began its peacekeeping mission 
two years ago, was on his second tour with the UN Force. He was 
an infantryman of the Third Battalion, Princess Patricia's 
Canadian Light Infantry, serving with the Canadian Battalion in 
Croatia.
