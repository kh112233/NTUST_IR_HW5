FT  24 AUG 93 / Welsh wind farm project unveiled
PROPOSALS for a wind farm in Wales will be set out today, as increasing
tensions emerge among environmentalists about whether to support wind power.
Trigen Windpower, a venture by British, Japanese and Californian renewable
energy specialists, is seeking planning permission from Port Talbot council
for the Pounds 4m project. It wants to erect 66 170ft-high turbines on
forestry land near Hirwaun, Mid-Glamorgan.
Earlier this month Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, approved a wind
farm in Cornwall, overturning the local authority. Two more wind projects
have been referred to Mr Gummer, and a further six are on appeal after
having been refused by councils.
Some environmental groups, such as Greenpeace, want more electricity
generated by wind power to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, one of the
gases implicated in global warming. But others, such as the Council for the
Protection of Rural England, say the turbines disfigure the countryside,
while local residents have complained about noise.
There are also concerns about the cost: electricity generated from wind
power costs up to 12p for a kilowatt hour compared with the 2.5p-3p that
electricity fetches on the wholesale market, and the 8p that households pay
for it.
Trigen said its 20MW farm would provide enough electricity for 17,000 homes
and would have a minimal impact on the landscape and local residents. It
would be fed into Port Talbot's power supply. Trigen said: 'A coal-fired
power station, producing the same amount of electricity, would also produce
over 1m tonnes of carbon dioxide as well as other damaging pollutants.'
