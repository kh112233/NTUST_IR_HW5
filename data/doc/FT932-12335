FT  29 APR 93 / Clashes mar Sri Lanka party chief's funeral
SRI LANKAN police clashed with mourners yesterday at the funeral of Mr
Lalith Athulathmudali, former minister of national security and more
recently president of a new opposition party, who was gunned down last
Friday when addressing an election rally in a suburb of Colombo.
One death was said to have resulted as students threw stones at the police,
who responded with teargas.
A Scotland Yard team is in Colombo to help the investigation into the
killing of Mr Athulathmudali. The body of a young Tamil, his presumed
assassin, was found nearby. The Colombo judicial medical officer said he
died of cyanide poisoning, capsules of which are standard equipment of the
highly motivated hit-men of the separatist Tamil Tigers.
The medical officer also reported that the killer had a bullet lodged in his
spine and injuries on his hip. Mr Athulathmudali's bodyguards had fired back
when the assassin aimed his revolver at the speaker on the platform.
A spokesman for the Tamil Tigers in London has denied that the Tigers were
involved.
The Tigers did have reason to hate Mr Athulathmudali. As national security
minister, he commanded 'Operation Liberation', the last attempt by the Sri
Lankan army to quell the 10-year-old secessionist revolt in the Tamil north
and ethnically-mixed eastern province.
Mr Athulathmudali, who as security minister, incurred the wrath of the
Tigers when he insisted that 14 Tiger terrorists in army custody in the
north should be brought to Colombo for trial. Despite Indian protests,
President Jayawardene backed Mr Athulathmudali. The 14 Tigers swallowed
their cyanide capsules.
After a dispute with Mr Premadasa, Mr Athulathmudali joined an opposition
motion to impeach the president. Lucky to survive, Mr Premadasa sacked the
plotters from the party. The new party, the Democratic United National
Front, was the outcome.
