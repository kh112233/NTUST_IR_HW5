FT  05 NOV 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Pocket guide to electronic
reading
For those Japanese commuters squashed into a train carriage and unable to
spread open the pages of their morning newspaper, the Japanese electronics
manufacturer NEC may have the answer.
The digital book player is a pocket-sized electronic reading device with a
liquid crystal screen. The player uses floppy discs as a means of loading
information into the machine - initially games, quizzes, guidebooks and
teaching materials.
In the future the devices could be connected to telephone lines or other
computers to download up-to-date financial statistics or the daily
newspaper.
Unlike the exaggerated movements needed to turn over the page of a
broadsheet newspaper, the digital book player turns the page at the press of
a button. NEC: Japan, 03 3798 6511; UK, 071 353 4383.
