SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On August 15, 1994, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 41750) that a modification of Permit No. 835, issued April 27, 1993 (58 FR 26288), had been requested by the above-named
organizations. The requested modification has been granted under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection
Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 

et

 

seq

.), the provisions of 216.33(d) and (e) of the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine
Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et

 

seq

.), and the provisions of 222.25 of the regulations governing the taking, importing, and exporting of endangered
fish and wildlife (50 CFR part 222).


Permit No. 835 authorized the permit holders for the inadvertent harassment of harbor seals (

Phoca

 

vitulina

), California sea lions (

Zalophus

 

californianus

), Steller sea lions (

Eumetopias

 

jubatus

), and elephant seals (

Mirounga

 

angustirostris

) incidental to the conduct of aerial, ground, and boat surveys. The permit holders were also authorized to capture,
mark, tag, brand, and sample harbor seals.
Permit No. 835 has now been modified to authorize the permit holders to mark and tag up to 50 male California sea lions
annually; to capture, mark, brand, tag, and release up to 150 male California sea lions annually, of which up to 50 may
be instrumented with radio/satellite tags or time-depth recorders (TDRs); and for the harassment of up to 1,000 additional
sea lions annually incidental to the proposed activities.
Issuance of this modification, as required by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, was based on a finding that such permit:
(1) Was applied for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the endangered species which is the subject
of this permit; and (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in 2 of the Endangered Species
Act.
