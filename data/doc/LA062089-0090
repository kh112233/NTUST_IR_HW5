CAR ROLLS, EJECTS 2 MEN; DRIVER DIES OF INJURIES 
An 18-year-old Fullerton man was killed and his passenger injured when their 
vehicle overturned, ejecting both men, police said Monday. 
The victim, Mark Steven Villegas, suffered head injuries in the one-car

The car rolled over, ejecting Villegas and his passenger, whose name was not

Neither man wore a seat belt, according to police reports. 
Villegas was pronounced dead hours later at UCI Medical Center in Orange. His 
passenger was transported to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, Fricke said.
