FT  19 JUL 94 / EU and Baltics sign trade pacts
The European Union signed free trade agreements with the three Baltic states
yesterday. The accords, which provide for free trade in industrial goods and
limited concessions in agriculture, bring the Baltic states closer to their
goal of joining the EU. German foreign minister Mr Klaus Kinkel said at the
signing ceremony that increasing trade was the most important way to further
economic reforms in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Estonian foreign minister
Mr Juri Luik said his country hoped to fulfil all EU membership requirements
by the year 2000. Mr Luik welcomed the European Commission's proposal to
hold initial talks by the end of this month on an association accord similar
to those with other east European countries.
