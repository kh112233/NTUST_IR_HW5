GRIDLOCK AND PROPOSITION 111 
If we vote for a higher gasoline tax for better roads, we are guaranteed that 
the tax will stay around forever, but we are not guaranteed that the revenue 
will be used for highways forever. 
History has shown that, in many cases, a tax for a particular purpose ends up 
in the general fund either directly or indirectly. What has happened to all the 
past taxes that we were promised would be used to fix up the roads? 
We, the voters, see government getting more inefficient at our expense. Until 
we get guarantees for our money, we will be reluctant to vote for any new 
taxes.
