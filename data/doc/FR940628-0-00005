SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65906), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 1B4286) had been filed by Ciba-Geigy
Corp., Seven Skyline Dr., Hawthorne, NY 105322188. The petition proposed that 178.2010 

Antioxidants and/or stabilizers for polymers

 (21 CFR 178.2010) be amended to provide for the safe use of 

N

-phenylbenzenamine reaction products with 2,4,4-trimethylpentenes as an antioxidant and/or stabilizer in pressure-sensitive
adhesives in contact with food. 



FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the
food additive is safe and that 178.2010 should be amended as set forth below.
In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before July 28, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
