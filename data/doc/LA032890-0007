DEATH PENALTY 
Your editorial "Barbarism in Iraq" (March 16) is excellent. Summary execution 
of a journalist is certainly barbaric. However, we need to think about its 
meaning in our own context. 
How much worse is their action than are ours? The United States is almost the 
only country in the industrialized world that still has the death penalty. Over 
the years we have executed many innocent people. Far more blacks and other 
minorities than whites receive the death penalty. Thus, the death penalty is in 
fact a form of racial hatred. Executions serve no practical purpose. The data 
shows that executions do not decrease the murder rate. 
Soon our state will perform the first execution in many years. That will be a 
dark day for all of us. 
"Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord." Why do we subvert our religious heritage 
by retaining useless capital punishment?
