FT  09 FEB 94 / Canadian tobacco taxes cut sharply
Canada yesterday sharply cut tobacco taxes in the hope of curbing the growth
in cigarette smuggling across its border with the US.
But the government balanced excise tax cuts with measures to avert a
backlash from anti-smoking groups, including a new 'health-promotion' surtax
on cigarette makers' profits and a promise of tighter curbs on the sale and
promotion of tobacco products.
The cross-border smuggling boom has its origins in high excise taxes, which
have pushed retail cigarette prices up to about CDollars 45 (Pounds 23) a
carton in Canada, almost double the US level. The problem is most acute in
Quebec, where contraband products now account for an estimated two-thirds of
total cigarette consumption.
Social and political concerns have put pressure on the government to clamp
down. Much of the traffic has fallen into the hands of organised crime.
Tensions have grown between law-enforcement authorities and Indian reserves,
which straddle the border and are a favourite route for contraband.
In addition, Quebec separatists have sought to portray the smuggling issue
as an example of the francophone province's interests being ignored by the
rest of the country.
The measures announced yesterday include a CDollars 5 tax cut per carton of
cigarettes, bringing federal taxes down to CDollars 11 a carton. Provinces
willing to cut their taxes by more than CDollars 5 will have the cuts
matched by the federal government.
The three-year surtax on tobacco companies is expected to raise about
CDollars 200m. Ottawa will levy an export tax of CDollars 8 per carton to
reflect the fact that most of the smuggled cigarettes originate in Canada.
