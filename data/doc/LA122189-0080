WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA; 
CHRISTMAS TREE RECYCLING 
The city will operate Christmas tree collection facilities at four locations on 
Dec. 30 and Jan. 6. Residents are encouraged to bring their trees in for 
recycling into compost and boiler fuel. 
In exchange for their trees, residents will receive a free pine tree seedling. 
Last year, more than 2,000 trees were collected for recycling. 
The collection points will be at four city parks: Clover Park at Ocean Park 
Boulevard and 25th Street, Douglas Park at Wilshire Boulevard and 25th Street, 
Lincoln Park at Lincoln and Wilshire boulevards and Los Amigos Park at 5th 
Street and Hollister Avenue. They will operate from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dec. 30 
and Jan. 6. 
"The goal of this project is not only to help reduce the amount of waste being 
disposed of in landfills, but also to educate the public that most trees and 
nearly all organic yard and kitchen waste have a great value when recycled into 
compost," said Deborah Baine, the city's recycling coordinator. 
The city has set a goal of reducing the amount of waste dumped in landfills by 
25%, and is conducting a study to determine the feasibility of separately 
collecting residential yard waste for compost. The study is expected to be 
completed in March.
