FT  01 FEB 93 / Letter: Working group set to resolve problems of safety for
shipping
Sir, The article on the shipping problems in the Strait of Malacca (January
26) highlighted a big problem quite accurately. But the headline,
'Malaysia's disaster warnings go unheeded in Strait of Malacca', was
inaccurate.
The International Maritime Organisation is so concerned about the situation
that at the end of last year the secretary-general, Mr W A O'Neil, formed a
special working group to consider, within the context of measures to prevent
and suppress piracy and armed robbery against ships, measures aimed at
enhancing navigational safety, environmental protection and other related
problems which exist in the region.
The working group consists of experts from a number of countries including
representatives of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The group has already
held its first meeting at IMO headquarters and will fly to Kuala Lumpur on
February 27 for a 10-day visit to all three countries which will enable the
problems to be examined in detail.
Following the visit, a report will be prepared which will be presented to
IMO's senior technical body, the Maritime Safety Committee, which meets from
May 24-28. Since the committee consists of all 136 IMO member states, it is
expected that it will be able to take decision that will be of benefit to
shipping security, safety and environmental protection in south-east Asia.
