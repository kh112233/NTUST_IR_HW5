  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (XINHUA) -- Henan, the second most 
populous province in China, registered a population growth rate 
of less than one percent in 1993, the lowest rate in a decade, 
Governor Ma Zhongchen said here today. 
  Ma, who is attending the ongoing session of the National 
People's Congress, told XINHUA that population growth has 
maintained a downward trend for the last three years in Henan, 
which has a population of 88 million, next only to Sichuan 
Province in size. 
  Henan's natural population growth rate was 9.52 per thousand 
in 1993, 1.62 per thousand lower than in 1992. Compared with 
the national average of 11.45 per thousand, this is seen as an 
excellent performance. 
  Back in 1990, Henan reported one of the highest population 
growth rates in China, at 18.4 per thousand. 
  "This seriously restrained local economic development," he 
said. 
  The province has in recent years adopted a series of 
measures 
to publicize family planning policies and related knowledge. 
  At present, 1,300 townships and urban neighborhood 
committees 
and 33,000 villages have set up family planning schools. Local 
governments have also given economic stimulus to households 
implementing birth control policies.
