<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  The 1990 mid-term report of the Electric Power Industry 
Council's Supply and Demand Section says that the current power 
situation is heading toward the actualization of conditions that 
will put constraints on electric power supply and demand. 
Fearing future critical supply-and-demand stringencies if the 
situation continues as is, the report points to the introduction 
of 5,700,000 kW of electricity by 2010 from distributed sources 
centering around new energies. In this scenario, there is 
progress in the development of fuel cells, which are noted for 
being the fourth kind of electric power generation. In 
particular, there are great expectations for molten carbonate 
fuel cells (MCFCs). 
  MCFCs are now at a level where 100-kW batteries are being 
tested. The development of fuel cells requires technologies that 
have to do with carbonate chemistry, high-temperature 
structures, heat transfer and flow, electrochemistry, and metal 
and ceramic materials. This article, however, as a special 
article on liquid chemistry, introduces the principles of fuel 
cells, centering on the technology used in dealing with MCFC 
liquids, and the state of MCFC development at 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. 
<H5>  2. MCFC Features </H5>
  The most important features of fuel cells are their high 
efficiency and that they are environmentally clean. 
  As with thermal power generation, fuel cells use fossil 
fuels, but in contrast to thermal power generation, which 
produces electrical energy by burning fuel to move thermal 
machinery, fuel cells convert the chemical energy of the fuel 
directly into electrical energy in an electrochemical reaction. 
For that reason fuel cells are not subject to Carnot efficiency 
limits, and, ideally, all of the free energy conversion in the 
reaction can be converted into work. The energy that can be 
converted into work by the reaction of the fuel and oxygen is 
very high -- about 80% of the energy produced by 
combustion. 
When current is produced with a fuel cell, the efficiency drops 
because of the loss due to the internal resistance, gas 
diffusion, and so forth, but even so a high power generation 
efficiency of 40-60% is obtained with a fuel cell. 
Furthermore, 
because the 700C heat discharge from an MCFC can be 
utilized, the use of MCFCs in urban cogeneration (heat and 
electricity supply) systems is anticipated. In that case, the 
overall thermal efficiency can be raised to 80%. 
  Because fuel cells do not burn fuel, they generate hardly 
any 
of the atmospheric pollutants, such as oxides of nitrogens, that 
are produced when fuel is burned at high temperatures. In 
addition, by using the water that results from fuel-cell power 
generation, systems that consume hardly any water can be set up. 
Furthermore, fuel cells are not moving machines, like turbines, 
so they generate little noise. That fact points to why fuel-cell 
power plants are not subject to site restrictions in urban areas. 
<H5>  3. Principles of an MCFC </H5>
<H5>  3.1 Basic Electrode Reaction </H5>
  When two electrodes are placed in water (the electrolyte) 
and 
a current flows between them, the electrolysis reaction results 
in the generation of hydrogen gas from one electrode and oxygen 
gas from the other. In a fuel cell, however, by having the 
reaction gases flow to the electrodes instead, direct current is 
generated between the electrodes. The fuel cell will continue to 
generate power as long as the reaction gas continues to be 
supplied. Figure 1 shows the principles of an MCFC. By supplying 
oxygen (air) and carbon dioxide in the cathode (air electrode) 
passage, an electrochemical reaction occurs at the cathode and 
carbonate ions form in the electrolyte. On the other hand, fuel 
supplied in the anode (the fuel electrode) passage undergoes an 
electrochemical reaction with the carbonate ions in the 
electrolyte to produce water vapor and carbon dioxide. Supplying 
the carbon dioxide produced at the anode to the cathode side 
results in an overall reaction in which the fuel and oxygen 
react to form water and carbon dioxide gas. At that time, a 
potential difference occurs between the cathode and anode, fuel 
and oxygen are consumed in the electrochemical reaction, and 
power is generated.

<H5>  3.2 Basic Structure of the Fuel Cell </H5>
  Figure 2 shows the basic structure of the fuel cell. The 
main 
structural components are the anode, cathode, electrolytic plate 
(also called a tile, it is a porous ceramic soaked with 
electrolyte), and a separator. This one set is called a single 
cell. The electrolytic plate is between two separators that use 
gas seals, called wet seals, which increase the liquid-retaining 
power in a wet state. We set up a device that squeezes the 
layered cells all together so that the wet seal and the 
components make good contact with each other.

  Table 1 gives the specifications for the main components. 
Next, I will point out the features of each component.

<H5>  3.2.1 The Electrodes </H5>
  The anode is a sintered compact of nickel powder. Because it 
is a porous metal, as shown in Figure 3, creep at high 
temperatures and changes in the fine structure due to the 
sintering become problems. However, we added Cr and Al to 
prevent creep and got a good electrode that changes very little 
over time. The cathode is a porous sintered plate of nickel 
oxide. The conductivity of the material holds up sufficiently 
during use because we doped it with lithium. When the partial 
pressure of the carbon dioxide increases in the cathode gas 
atmosphere, the cathode solves out into the electrolytic plate, 
which in turn can cause an electrical short between the anode 
and cathode. To keep that from happening, we added a third 
substance to decrease the solubility of the material's surface; 
during operation, the fuel cell is run with the carbon dioxide's 
partial pressure lowered. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-16D>      Figure 3. Microscopic Photograph of Anode </FIG>


<H5>  3.2.2 The Electrolytic Plate </H5>
  The electrolytic plate is a porous sheet made of 
LiAlO[.sub]2[/] powder (the electrolyte-retaining material) 
that is soaked with a dissolved carbonate, which is the 
electrolyte. Li[.sub]2[/]CO[.sub]3[/] and 
K[.sub]2[/]CO[.sub]3[/], both of which have a melting 
point of about 490C, are mainly used for the carbonate. In 
order to prevent combustion that is caused by air and fuel 
mixing in the cell and to keep the reaction gases from leaking 
outside of the cell, we made the pores of the electrolytic plate 
between the cathode and anode small, i.e., with sub-micron 
diameters, and increased the liquid-retaining power of the plate 
by means of capillary tube forces so that the pores are almost 
completely filled with electrolyte. While the electrolytic plate 
is ceramic, metal is used for the separator material. During 
heat cycling, cracks due to the thermal stress appeared in the 
electrolytic plate. To solve that, however, we increased the 
strength by mixing coarse particles and fiber into the 
electrolytic plate. The stability of the LiAlO[.sub]2[/] 
powder when it is soaked with electrolyte, which was an issue, 
is improved by controlling the surface properties of the powder 
and the phase state of the material. 
<H5>  3.2.3 The Separator </H5>
  The separator plays three roles: it separates the cathode 
gas 
from the anode gas, supplies reaction gases to all of the 
electrode surfaces, and acts as a conductor that connects the 
layers of cells. Because a molten salt is used, the surface of 
the wet seal that is wet with electrolyte and the anode passage 
are in a severely corrosive environment. For the wet seal, we 
can keep the corrosion down to a permissible range by 
aluminizing it. Of the various aluminizing methods, slurry 
coating, plating, and flame coating are methods that can be used 
for large-scale separators. The metals used in the passages and 
the diaphragm must exhibit corrosion resistance in both the 
atmospheres on the anode and cathode sides. We solved the 
corrosion problem by using nickel on the anode side and 
copper-clad stainless steel on the cathode side. 
<H5>  3.3 Electrolyte Liquid Control Technique </H5>
  A layered body of materials with different pore diameters 
achieves a balance of forces due to the capillary tube forces, 
as shown in Figure 4. The relation describing that balance in 
the fuel cell is 
<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-17A>      Equation </FIG>

  where p is the gas pressure, d is the pore diameter, _s_ 
is 
the surface tension, _r_ is the electrolyte density, h is the 
height of the liquid, _th_ is the leakage angle, a indicates 
the 
anode side, and c indicates the cathode side. A porous material 
has a pore diameter distribution, and a typical fine structure 
consisting of the basic components of the fuel cell, i.e., the 
anode, cathode, and electrolytic plate, is like that shown in 
Figure 5. The electrolyte liquid soaks in from where the pore 
diameters are small to the diameter that corresponds to the 
filling amount, then the parts where the pore diameters are 
larger than that become a gas space and do not fill up with 
electrolyte. This balance arises even in layers of porous 
materials. Figure 6 is a conceptual diagram of electrolyte 
soaking states. The electrode reaction occurs between the 
reaction gases, ions, and electrons. To bring out the 
performance of the fuel cell, the appropriate amount of 
electrolyte must soak into the electrode vacancy areas that are 
porous, and three interfaces -- between the reaction gases, the 
electron-conducting electrodes, and the ion-conducting 
electrolyte -- must form adequately. In addition, because the 
electrolyte dissipates due to leakage, corrosion, and 
vaporization during operation, the amount of that dissipation 
must be taken into account when initially filling the electrodes 
with electrolyte. The fine structure of the electrodes and the 
electrolytic plate and the amount of electrolyte are determined 
in such a way that as those functions are fulfilled.

<H5>   4. State of Development, and Topics </H5>
<H5>  4.1 Power Generation Characteristics </H5>
  Like dry batteries, the lower the voltage obtained from a 
fuel cell, the larger the current that is produced. The voltage 
increases along with an increase in the process gas pressure, so 
higher efficiency and more compact piping are considered in 
planning the operation of large-scale power plants under 
pressurized conditions. Figure 7 shows the performance of a 
10-kW stack under pressure; the stack consists of 10 layers of 
cells with 1-m[.sup]2[/] electrodes. An output of 12 kW is 
obtained with an operating pressure of 7 atmospheres and a load 
current of 1500 A. As for larger-scale fuel cells, we are now 
testing the kind of 100-kW fuel cell shown in Figure 8, which 
has 50 1-m[.sup]2[/] cell layers above and below an 
intermediate holder.

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-18C>      Figure 8. 100-kW Fuel Cell </FIG>


  A fuel cell lifetime ranging from 25,000 hours to 40,000 
hours, depending on the system, is said to be cost effective. 
Now, 10,000 hours of operation can be had with a kW-class fuel 
cell stack, which offsets the cost by just a hair's breadth. 
Figure 9 shows the relationship between the rate of a fuel 
cell's deterioration and the amount of electrolyte dissipation. 
The amount of electrolyte dissipation needs to be reduced 
further to lengthen the lifetime of fuel cells. We are pouring 
our effort into increasing the carbonate-retaining power by 
reducing the average pore diameters in the fine structure of the 
electrolytic plate, and preventing carbonate loss by reducing 
the separator's wet area.

<H5>  4.2 Production Techniques </H5>
  At first we produced the electrolytic plate by mixing the 
retaining material powder with the electrolyte powder, then 
putting that into a mold and pressing it at a temperature very 
close to that of the electrolyte's melting point. With the 
hot-press method, however, larger-scale plates were difficult to 
make. Now we make the electrolytic plates by means of a 
tape-forming method with a doctor blade, which is used in making 
ceramic sheets. The doctor blade method is a way of using a 
doctor blade to thinly coat a film with a slurry consisting of 
the material powder mixed with a solvent, binding agent, and a 
dispersing agent to get the appropriate viscosity. The doctor 
blade method makes possible the production of large-scale, thin, 
uniform electrolytic plates by means of a tape-forming device. 
(The tape made by the tape forming is called a green tape.) Now, 
1-m[.sup]2[/]-class electrolytic plates are formed 
continuously. The electrodes are made by the same method, but, 
the electrodes are baked before they are incorporated into the 
fuel cell whereas the electrolytic plate is left as a tape. 
  The component parts of the separator are made from a thin 
plate, the objective of which is to make them all compact, but 
the number of parts is large and the processing is difficult. We 
are now investigating separators that are press-formed from thin 
plates, which may enable mass production. 
<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  Under the New Sunshine Project, we were commissioned by the 
New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization 
(NEDO) to develop an MCFC. We are now at the stage of testing a 
100-kW MCFC. In parallel with that effort, we are aiming for 
commercialization in our research to develop lower-cost 
separators and our investigations of a MW-class plant as an MCFC 
demonstration plant after the 100-kW tests conclude. The 
American Public Power Association in the U.S. also chose the 
MCFC from the various types of fuel cells, and the Energy 
Research Corporation has embarked on the development of a 2-MW 
MCFC. In Europe, too, development efforts have gained momentum. 
  We want to work toward reliability improvements and cost 
reduction in order to put the MCFC out in the world. Look 
forward to future developments.
