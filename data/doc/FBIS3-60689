<H5>  ``Cold Fusion'' </H5>
  Although the scandal in connection with illegal accumulation 
of wealth of Z. Panic and his son, the owner of the ``Kentaur'' 
Company, was disclosed in May, he remained chief of General 
Staff until the end of August. An established state board had 
the task of examining the circumstances in connection with the 
``Panic'' scandal (it was led by the unlucky Minister Pavle 
Bulatovic), but it has not written a report for the public yet. 
If Seselj is lying, why is not he put on trial? If General 
Panic had stolen, why is he not he on trial...? 
  One of the people we spoke with says this is ``a game within 
a game,'' adding that General Panic is an important man of the 
Serbian regime, one of the ``untouchables.'' His name is 
mentioned in connection with dealing with weapons and oil 
through a federal foreign trade institution. This institution 
has in the meantime been transformed into a company that 
functions as a fictitious cover for everything (``Jugoimport''), 
about which Seselj spoke for NIN, fearing that this weekly would 
be prohibited after this information is published! 
  The journeys of General Panic to Russia and Iraq in March 
1993 can be seen in this light. MONITOR wrote last month that 
large quantities of ammunition are entering Serbia and go on to 
Bosnia, and that there is also the transfer of weapons and parts 
for manufacturing 1000-km range missiles. It is also mentioned 
that technology is being imported and concentrated in the 
nuclear institutes in Serbia. The process of ``cold fusion,'' 
which would enable to equip the missiles with nuclear warheads, 
is being tested. [passage omitted]
