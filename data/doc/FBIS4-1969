  [Text] Beijing, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The 40,000 university 
graduates in Beijing this year will have good job opportunities, 
official sources from the municipal education department said 
today. 
  The sources said that, generally speaking, the number of 
university students still falls short of society's needs. 
  Beijing will have 34,000 students graduating from 
universities and colleges, 5,000 from post-graduate study and 
761 from doctorship [as received] study this July, the sources 
said. 
  So far 50 percent of the graduates have found jobs through 
the job market and other means, while the other 50 percent are 
still making their choices, the sources said. 
  They predicted that some 90 percent of the graduates will be 
able to find jobs to their satisfaction by mid-June. 
  The number of graduates going into large and middle-sized 
state-owned enterprises has increased remarkably, but into 
government bodies has been dropping over recent years, the 
sources said. Most of the graduates are going into grass-root 
enterprises. 
  The sources said the education department has set up a 
special fund, which gives each graduate choosing to work in 
remote and less-developed regions one thousand to five thousand 
yuan as an encouragement.
