'STAR WARS' LASER TEST RATED A SUCCESS 
A high-power chemical laser developed for the "Star Wars" program has been 
successfully tested for the first time in a vacuum chamber simulating the 
conditions of space, the Pentagon said. The test, described as "a major 
milestone" by the Defense Department, was conducted Friday at a special 
facility in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. While the so-called Alpha laser 
generated a laser beam for only one-fifth of a second, the initial "first 
light" test was sufficient to verify the theoretical calculations that were 
made in designing the device, said Neil Griff, the program manager for chemical 
lasers with the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization. Built by TRW of 
Redondo Beach, the Alpha is a hydrogen fluoride chemical laser that produces 
energy from chemical combustion. The device and program so far have cost about 
$200 million, officials said.
