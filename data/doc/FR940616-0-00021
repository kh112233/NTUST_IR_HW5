SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On January 6, 1993, FSIS published in the 

Federal Register

 a final rule titled ``Nutrition Labeling of Meat and Poultry Products'' (58 FR 638). Corrections and technical amendments
to this final rule were published on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 43787), and on September 10, 1993 (59 FR 47624), respectively.
The technical amendments, which were issued as an interim final rule, were confirmed as final on March 16, 1994 (59
FR 12157). The effective date of the final rule is July 6, 1994. 


The final rule amends the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations to permit voluntary nutrition
labeling on single-ingredient, raw meat and poultry products, and establishes a mandatory nutrition labeling program
for all other meat and poultry products, with certain exceptions. FSIS's nutrition labeling regulations are designed
to parallel, to the extent possible, the nutrition labeling regulations issued by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for all other foods. Both agencies cooperated closely in the development and timeframe for implementation
of their respective rules. 
FDA's final nutrition labeling regulations became effective on May 8, 1994. However, Congress recently amended
the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (NLEA) to extend the compliance date for certain FDA-regulated food
products packaged prior to August 8, 1994, to comply with the nutrition labeling requirements. The legislation (S.
2087) was passed by both houses of Congress, and signed into law by the President on May 27, 1994. Although it is not subject
to the NLEA, FSIS has decided not to take any enforcement action on nutrition labeling of meat and poultry products
until August 8, 1994. FSIS believes that this date is reasonable and practical, and reflects its continued cooperation
with FDA on nutrition labeling issues. FSIS also believes that the extended timeframe further minimizes the cost
of complying with the regulations and allows for a more orderly and uniform compliance implementation for nutrition
labeling of all foods. 
In anticipation of the July 6, 1994, effective date, the Food Labeling Division has granted temporary label approvals
under 9 CFR 317.4(d) and 381.132(b) of the regulations. These temporary approvals were granted for labels which comply
with current regulations, but which would not comply with the regulations when the final rule issued on January 6,
1993, is effective. These temporary approvals are automatically extended until August 8, 1994. 
FSIS encourages manufacturers to revise their labels as soon as possible. On and after August 8, 1994, products with
labeling that does not comply with the nutrition labeling regulations will be misbranded and subject to enforcement
action by FSIS.
