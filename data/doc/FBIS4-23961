  [Text] Tina Susman, who works for the AP news agency, has 
been kidnapped in Mogadishu. She was in a four-wheel-drive 
vehicle, with a police escort, when she was stopped by a group 
of men who forced her to get out of her vehicle and enter 
another car. 
  According to investigators, she was kidnapped for a ransom. 
The police think she was kidnapped by the crew of a car she had 
rented, and who were then fired because she was about to leave. 
She managed to contact some people and said she was being 
treated all right.
