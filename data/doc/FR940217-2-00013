SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The subject permit is requested under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C.
1361 

et seq.

), the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), and the regulations governing the taking, importing, and exporting of endangered fish and wildlife (50 CFR part
222). 


This application modification is to request incidental harassment of sea turtles, and additional species of marine
mammals which have only occasionally been observed in Hawaiian waters. As described in the original permit application,
permission is requested to incidentally harass marine mammals and sea turtles by a low frequency (70 Hz) sound source
which will be located north of Haena, off the northern coast of Kauai, Hawaii, at a depth of 850950m. This sound
source is part of the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) program, and will be operated from February 1994
through December 1995, with a maximum duty cycle of 8%, to conduct research on the effects of this source on marine mammals
and sea turtles. The transmission bandwidth is 20 Hz with a level of 195 dB (re: 1 uPa at 1m), and the spectrum level for
the peak frequency (70 Hz) is 
182 dB. The effects of these transmissions on marine mammals and sea turtles will be monitored through passive acoustic
tracking of Mysticetes, shore-based visual observations of marine mammals, and aerial observations and surveys
of marine mammals and sea turtles.
