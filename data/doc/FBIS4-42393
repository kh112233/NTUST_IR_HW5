  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Right-wing extremist acts of violence 
have decreased. The Cologne-based Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution said on 31 May that from 1 
January to 19 May this year, 563 acts of violence with proved or 
assumed extreme right-wing motivation were noted. Compared with 
the last 20 weeks of 1993 (594), the number of such acts of 
violence thus decreased by approximately 5 percent. 
  Of the 563 violent acts, 331 (as against 408 in the period 
of 
comparison in 1993) were motivated by xenophobia. This means a 
decrease by approximately 19 percent. The share of arson and 
explosive attacks is 10 percent. In the period of comparison in 
1993, it was approximately 12 percent. In 1994, six homicidal 
attempts by right-wing extremists were noted. In the last 20 
weeks of 1993, the number was the same.
