FT  07 JUL 92 / Dentists take preventive action against cut in fees: John
Willman on a dispute caused in part by a successful treatment drive
THE DISPUTE over fees for providing dental treatment on the National Health
Service intensified yesterday with the threat by dentists to refuse NHS
treatment to many patients.
The cause of the dispute is the decision by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, to cut the fees for NHS dental work by 7 per cent. She says the
fees need to be cut because dentists' earnings are higher than the levels
recommended by the Doctors and Dentists Pay Review Body.
The overpayment appears to have been caused by a misfit between the new
contract introduced in October 1990 that encourages dentists to sign up new
patients and a pay-review body system which tries to establish a target
income for the dentists working under the contract. The success of dentists
in signing up new patients has led to higher-than-expected earnings which
the fee cuts are now designed to claw back.
The difficulty arises because almost all NHS dentists are self-employed,
contracting with the health service to provide dental care. They are paid a
per capita fee for each NHS patient on their list, plus fees for procedures
or treatments carried out. The fees are set by the Dental Rates Study Group,
which brings together dentists and health department officials under an
independent chairman.
Out of the gross income produced by these fees, dentists must pay their
expenses - premises, staff, equipment, materials and laboratory services. It
is their net income after deduction of expenses which the pay review body
sets.
However, setting the fees requires an estimate of the average gross income
which dentists need to earn. This is calculated by adding an allowance for
expenses and notional rent to the target net income set by the pay review
body.
The table shows how this calculation was done for 1992-93. The pay review
body recommended an 8.5 per cent rise in net remuneration and set average
net earnings at Pounds 35,815. This was more than 8.5 per cent above the
1991-92 figure because that year's award was staged.
The health department's calculations for expenses and notional rent meant
that this required a target average gross income of Pounds 83,207. However,
the fees set in the previous year would have produced an estimated turnover
per dentist in 1992-93 of more than Pounds 90,000. Meeting the target
average gross income appeared to require a cut in fees.
The reason for this is the dentists success in signing up NHS patients.
Aided by a health department campaign, they have raised the number of
patients on their lists to around 30m, against an estimate of 24m.
Mr Michael Watson of the British Dental Association, larger of the two
dentists' associations, said: 'Going to the dentist is becoming more
popular, thanks to the tremendous effort by Britain's dentists. If the
government's policy of rewarding performance means anything, it must mean
that this improvement in health care cannot lead to a cut in fees.'
The original proposal to cut fees by 13.8 per cent was shelved before the
election. Last month Mrs Bottomley came up with a proposal for a 7 per cent
cut, which the government claims would still leave dentists' average net
earnings at more than Pounds 40,000 a year - well above the review body's
target.
Dentists say the extra work they have generated has forced their expenses
above the department's estimates and the result of the 7 per cent cuts would
be an average net income of around Pounds 30,000 a year  - well below the
review body's target.
Both sides appear prepared to go to the brink in defending their positions.
The dentists' ballots are likely to mean an acceleration in the numbers of
dentists withdrawing from NHS work, a process already happening because of
discontent with the terms of the new contract.
Dentists' leaders are anxious to avoid precipitate action, and are
cautioning their members against undue haste. NHS patients already on
dentists' lists are unlikely to be refused treatment immediately but
patients signing up for the first time or transferring from another dentist
could find it harder to get registered.
The government is standing behind its promise of a 'fundamental review'
aimed at developing a more effective remuneration system for dentists which
meets criticisms that the current contract under-values preventive work.
Mrs Bottomley has said that threats by dentists to withdraw from NHS work
will not be allowed to undermine the service. She has promised to expand the
number of dentists directly employed by the health service in areas where
dentists fail to offer NHS treatment.
However, whether this can be more than a stop-gap remains to be seen. There
are fewer than 100 salaried dentists at present. With pay at between Pounds
18,755 and Pounds 27,305 a year, the attractions of a salaried post would
need to be considerably improved if there were mass withdrawals by
self-employed dentists.
If such withdrawals accelerate, they will give credence to the dentists'
claims that the government is intent on privatising NHS dentistry.
Yesterday's ballots by the two main associations indicate that whether or
not this is the government's intention, a failure to resolve the dispute
soon is likely to have privatisation as its ultimate effect.
