  [Text] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus reacted to today's 
speech by [Slovak Prime Minister] Vladimir Meciar and observed 
that he was not present at his talks with Karel Pezl, [former] 
chief of the Czechoslovak Army General Staff, which reportedly 
took place during the meeting of the Council for State Defense 
on 28 September 1992. Klaus declined to comment on the absurd 
idea of a plan for a military attack against Slovakia and 
declared that he did not hold any talks with Meciar on this 
subject.
