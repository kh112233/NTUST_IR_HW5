FT  13 OCT 93 / Argentina in aircraft talks
ARGENTINA has been in talks with a US subsidiary of Smiths Industries of the
UK to modernise second-hand fighter bombers its air force is buying from the
US to replace those shot down by Britain in the 1982 Falklands conflict.
Smiths' US unit says it 'actively competed' for the contract, even though a
British arms embargo imposed during the conflict remains in force.
The company's avionics division, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said this
week it had held meetings in Buenos Aires with local defence ministry
officials. More talks were planned this week in the US with Mr Oscar
Camilion, Argentine defence minister, who will make a counter-proposal to
the bid.
UK and Argentine government officials agree there is little chance that
Smiths will win the contract unless the embargo is relaxed. By negotiating
with a British company for a defence contract Argentina may be trying to
underline the 'anachronistic' nature of the embargo.
Smiths in the UK said: 'This is a responsible company. It is not one that is
going to break any embargoes or sanctions imposed by governments.' Smiths
was 'not going to supply anyone that does not have the approval by the
government agencies involved.'
Argentina is negotiating to buy 36 second-hand A4M Skyhawk fighter bombers
from the US Navy. The US agreed to sell the aircraft to Argentina in 1992,
but bowed to requests by the UK that they should not be equipped with
electronics or weapons systems that might threaten British forces based on
the Falkland Islands.
A senior Smiths executive was in Argentina last week 'answering questions'
from the air force. A marketing director involved in the talks said Smiths
had informed both Washington and London it would make an 'initial top-level
presentation' in Argentina concerning the contract.
