<F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Shlomo Ganor and Eli Nisan; date not given; from the weekly 
"Encounter" program -- recorded in Hebrew with Arabic subtitles; 
processed from the Hebrew] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Nisan] What is expected to 
take place in your upcoming talks with Yasir 'Arafat? 
  [Peres] We will make a supreme effort to reach agreement on 
the issues still in dispute. Also, I believe we will prepare 
for the following meetings. In the meeting we had in Oslo we 
discussed two important issues: One, regarding the elections, I 
told Mr. 'Arafat that if the Palestinians decide, for example, 
to hold municipal elections before holding general elections, 
naturally we will not oppose this. It is their decision to 
make. The other issue, which I proposed and which was accepted, 
was that the negotiations about early empowerment [last two 
words in English] will be held in Taba following the current 
negotiations. Naturally, Jericho will then be, to a large 
extent, its administrative center. 
  [Ganor] Did you get a positive reply to your suggestion that 
the elections to the municipal and rural councils be held prior 
to the elections to the autonomy council? 
  [Peres] I have not received a reply to that yet, but I 
believe that they view it positively. I received a positive 
reply regarding the issue of early empowerment. 
  [Nisan] Seeing the difficulties in the negotiations with the 
PLO, how involved is Mubarak, and Egypt in general, in the 
attempts to bring the Israeli and the PLO stands closer to 
attaining the implementation of the agreement? 
  [Peres] The Egyptians are certainly trying to play a 
constructive role, which today is called a facilitator [last 
word in English]. Sometimes it also helps. For example, last 
time we were in Cairo for negotiations, they were concluded in 
President Mubarak's office. In fact, he chaired the meeting. 
There we agreed that I and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] go out to 
meet the press together and report on the agreements made by the 
two delegations. I did just that, and Mr. Abu-Mazin stood at my 
side and confirmed my remarks. They are called the Cairo 
understandings. 
  [Ganor] Will the differences be really settled in Davos? 
  [Peres] I am not certain. I cannot make guesses. Talks are 
being held in Cairo at this very minute to search for a way out. 
Some of the work was done there, although I am afraid that a lot 
of work was left for the two of us in Davos. 
  [Nisan] What do you feel as you prepare to leave for Davos 
this evening? The impression is that the optimism of the past 
is today somewhat qualified and you are more careful in your 
optimistic remarks? 
  [Peres] I have always been careful regarding dates and 
places because it does not only depend on us or me. Basic 
strategic optimism has prevailed, but it is not only up to our 
side to bridge all the gaps. 
  [Nisan] Are you not trying to lower expectations toward the 
meeting in Davos? 
  [Peres] That is because some people have downplayed the 
importance of the existing differences -- they are not simple, 
but are serious. We are working hard to find previously untried 
solutions. The past solutions were not good enough either. 
  [Ganor] Does that mean that 13 April -- the forecasted date 
for the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho -- is not realistic? 
  [Peres] It is hard to tell. If we really finalize things in 
Davos, we could perhaps meet this date. If not, it will take 
another month. 
  [Ganor] This means that there are no longer sacred dates? 
  [Peres] There are dates we have agreed upon. Agreed-upon 
things are sacred. According to the agreement, we have to 
complete the withdrawal four months after the agreement is 
signed. It has not yet been signed. Thus, we always have four 
months from that date to work. [passage omitted] 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, with your permission we will move on to 
discuss the Syrian track. Has Israel indeed received an 
unequivocal explanation from Syria that it is prepared to reach 
a separate agreement with Israel that will stand on its own? 
  [Peres] What we have been told exactly is that the Syrians 
are prepared to conduct Syrian-Israeli negotiations. In other 
words, the negotiation process itself will stand on its own. We 
still do not know what the outcome will be. However, I would 
like to tell you something. Speaking for myself, I accept the 
Syrian challenge. Mr. al-'Allaf, the head of the Syrian 
delegation told our chief negotiator Itamar Rabinovich that 
al-Asad had spoken in Geneva not as Syria's ruler but as the 
leader of the whole Arab world. Okay. Let al-Asad bring peace 
to the entire Arab world, not just to us. When the Arabs speak 
of a comprehensive peace they are including everything Israel 
has included. A comprehensive peace includes everything that is 
part of the Arab world. It is about time that all the Arab 
countries, except for the three rogue states -- Iraq, Iran, and 
Libya -- sit down at the negotiating table together with 
al-Asad, establish diplomatic relations with Israel, open 
borders and markets, etc. 
  [Ganor] Was Israel satisfied with this Syrian explanation? 
  [Peres] The Syrians have not said this yet. I say that 
Israel must state that a comprehensive peace does not only 
pertain to Israel's assets but also to the attitude of the Arab 
world and diplomatic relations with Israel. 
  [Ganor] Mr. Peres, what if the negotiations with Syria take 
a long time, in light of the obstacles and differences between 
both parties' positions? Do you see any possibility of reaching 
an interim accord with the Syrians prior to a comprehensive 
peace agreement? 
  [Peres] I doubt that Syria will agree to this. Perhaps 
Israel could consider it but I do not see Syria going for it. 
Look, I think we have to either achieve a comprehensive peace 
or negotiate with each party on a separate basis. We must 
differentiate between separate and successive negotiations with 
each party and the peace that will eventually encompass all the 
parties and enable us to build a new Middle East. 
  [Ganor] Which steps should be taken in order to accelerate 
the negotiations between Syria and Israel? Would you recommend 
a summit meeting between foreign ministers or heads of 
government? 
  [Peres] The psychological dimension must undoubtedly be 
considered. The negotiations should be opened up on all sides 
and both formal and informal contacts should be held. The 
difference between civil servants and ministers, for example, is 
that the latter enjoy one privilege: They can make mistakes. 
In negotiations you must have people that can make mistakes 
because if you only send people who are forbidden to err, the 
negotiations will not make progress. Today, the negotiations 
are being held on one narrow track, infested with microphones, 
and the echo is louder than the actual words. Anything that is 
said reverberates far more than warranted. 
  [Ganor] How would you sum up this week of talks in 
Washington on the Syrian track? 
  [Peres] The talks were held in a positive atmosphere but not 
much progress was made. 
  [Nisan] Mr. Peres, on the basis of the Egyptian precedent, 
would you support stationing U.S. troops between the Syrian and 
Israeli armies in order to promote the negotiations with Syria? 
  [Peres] I think that with Syria, just as was the case with 
Egypt, we must first make a supreme effort to create a situation 
in which we will not need to station any foreign troops. Then 
we shall see. You know, in the Egyptian case, the idea of 
stationing U.S. troops was not so much an essential element of 
the peace itself, it was more like the final validation. So let 
us first achieve peace and then we will seek a way to give it a 
final stamp of approval. 
  [Ganor] How involved is the United States in this respect? 
Did they offer their good services this week? 
  [Peres] First of all, the Americans are the ones who are 
urging both parties to meet. They are trying to bridge the 
difficulties both parties encounter along the way, and the 
United States is playing the role of an honest broker [last two 
words in English]. 
  [Ganor] Last night we saw this when King Husayn appeared at 
Secretary of State Christopher's side. Yesterday, King Husayn 
publicly admitted for the first time that he had met with all 
Israeli prime ministers, including yourself Mr. Peres, except 
for the late Menahem Begin. What is your reaction to his 
professed readiness to publicly meet with the Israeli prime 
minister? 
  [Peres] I attach great importance to this. One of the 
drawbacks in Israel's relationship with Jordan -- a relationship 
which also has many advantages -- has always been this coyness 
and timidity, as though peace is something that should be kept 
secret. You know, the Jordanians were furious on numerous 
occasions when Israel leaked the news of the meetings. 
  [Ganor] For example, on 3 November when you met with.... 
  [Peres, interrupting] Now people are starting to understand 
what happened then. 
  [Ganor] So what happened then? 
  [Peres] Patience. You will have to wait a little bit more 
for me to reveal all my secrets. On the other hand, we told the 
Jordanians that it is time to legitimize peace. What must be 
hidden here? At least we can reveal things about the peace 
negotiations. In my opinion, a very important step forward has 
now been taken. It is the second step because the first step 
was the meeting between Crown Prince Hasan and myself at the 
White House together with President Clinton. Both Jews and 
Arabs, Jordanians and Israelis, should be shown that peace is 
nothing to be ashamed about and there is no need to hide it and 
to act as though it was some kind of underground activity. 
Peace is a great hope that should be expressed proudly so it 
can influence everyone, and I am convinced that despite the 
presence of some religious fanatics in Jordan, most Jordanian 
citizens support peace. I was very impressed with the level of 
culture and education among the Jordanian people. 
  [Ganor] Could you tell us what kind of impression the 
Jordanian monarch left on you following your meetings? 
  [Peres] He left an excellent impression of a very serious 
and experienced man, full of goodwill, in control of all the 
facts and of himself. I believe him to be a man who really 
prays for peace and yearns for it from the depth of his heart. 
  [Ganor] The question is when. Did you receive any 
indication of that in your last meeting with him on 3 November? 
  [Peres] As far as King Husayn is concerned, the question of 
when is tied to other constraints. We constantly say that we 
are surrounded by certain neighbors. He is also surrounded by 
neighbors, but we only have eyes for our own problems. I can 
say only one thing: One does not choose one's parents or 
neighbors. What one can choose is the relationship between 
neighbors and between parents and children. We are not going to 
change the fact that we are neighbors but we are going to change 
our relationship. [passage omitted]
