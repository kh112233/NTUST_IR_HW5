LUJAN AND SQUIRRELS 
Our "environmental" President should sit down with Lujan, who says, "Nobody's 
told me the difference between the red squirrel, a black one, or a brown one," 
and explain what the Endangered Species Act is about. 
For one thing, it is all about endangered red squirrels and hundreds of other 
species already listed as endangered or threatened or awaiting action by the 
Fish and Wildlife Service to save them from extinction. 
Lujan complains that the act is "too tough" and then asks, plaintively, "Do we 
have to save every subspecies?" The answer, Mr. Secretary, is yes, we must try. 
The bear on California's state flag should remind us of what we have done to 
some of our species. It is a grizzly. And it is extinct in California and in 
most other states where it once roamed. Hundreds of other mammals, birds, 
reptiles and other animals have been lost in the inexorable drive to cut down 
our forests, fill in our wetlands and destroy millions of acres of other plant 
and animal habitats.
