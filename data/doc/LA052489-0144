WORLD; 
TAXI BOMB KILLS 3 POLICE IN SPAIN 
A booby-trapped taxi blew three policemen to pieces in Bilbao today in the 
bloodiest Basque guerrilla ambush in 18 months, officials said. 
A 110-pound bomb went off in the trunk of the car as three bomb disposal 
experts were trying to defuse it. The blast sent human remains flying 50 yards 
away. Four other policemen, a fireman and four civilians were injured in the 
attack. Officials blamed the ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) guerrillas 
fighting for Basque independence for the bomb.
