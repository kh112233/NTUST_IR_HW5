FT  01 JUN 93 / Demonstrations in Solingen
Riot police in Solingen, Germany, yesterday drive back demonstrators two
days after the deaths of two Turkish women and three girls in an arson
attack blamed on neo-Nazis. Early yesterday, protesters rampaged through the
town, near Cologne, looting and causing damage. Police have arrested a
16-year-old rightwinger on suspicion of murder and fire-raising, but
inquiries continue.
