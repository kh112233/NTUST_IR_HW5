FT  13 MAY 92 / Mystery madonna
An amateur collector yesterday issued a challenge to the art world, claiming
a painting he bought for Pounds 360 is a Raphael. If genuine, the painting
could sell for as much as Pounds 10m. Without expert endorsement it would
fetch no more than thousands.
Amid tight security and considerable secrecy, the Madonna And Child,
pictured above with a security guard, was revealed to the world at a London
hotel by Timothy Benoy, solicitor for Lester Winward, who owns the painting.
Mr Winward did not attend.
However, Nicholas Penny, the only Raphael expert yet to examine the
painting, immediately dismissed it as the work of a copyist.
Mr Winward, a Cheshire businessman who wants to sell the work, responded
later by saying the tests he had carried out were the same as those used
last year by Mr Penny to authenticate a Raphael owned by the Duke of
Northumberland.
The painting, bought in 1981 at an auction at Leeswood House, near Mold,
north Wales, bears a strong resemblance to part of Raphael's Sistine
Madonna. Mr Benoy said research suggested the picture might have come to
England in 1636 as a purchase by Charles I, a keen art collector, or as a
gift to his queen from the Vatican.
