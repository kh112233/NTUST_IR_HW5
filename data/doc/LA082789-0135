SPANISH BARRACKS ATTACKED 
Suspected Basque separatist guerrillas fired a grenade at a Civil Guard 
barracks in the town of Ondarroa in northern Spain on Friday night, causing 
slight damage but no injuries, police said Saturday. They said they believe 
that the nationalist group ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) is responsible.
