FT  11 OCT 94 / Nobel medicine prize awarded
The Nobel Prize for medicine was awarded yesterday to two Americans, Alfred
Gilman and Martin Rodbell, for pioneering work on the role of proteins in
human cell communication. Sweden's Karolinska Institute, which announced the
SKr7m (Pounds 602,000) award, said the discovery of G-proteins and their
links with the development of disease had been 'of paramount importance'
opening up a 'new and rapidly expanding area of knowledge'. The institute
described the G-protein as a biological 'traffic light' which regulates the
body but can cause illness if it breaks down. Mr Rodbell, 68, of the
National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina,
showed in the 1960s and 1970s how messages were carried between cells. His
work was later developed by Mr Gilman, 53, currently chairman of the
pharmacology department at the University of Texas.
