<H5>  Main incidents: </H5>
  The PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] death toll of 
11 shows encouraging signs of decreasing levels of violence in 
this sub-region. The past two weeks recorded 16 and 13 deaths 
respectively. 
  Natal's death toll includes another massacre of 11 ANC 
[African National Congress] supporters. This is the third 
massacre, within a month, in which all the victims have been ANC 
supporters. 
  Bophuthatswana entered the spotlight of repressive activity 
during a week of harsh security force action in response to mass 
protests. 
  The HRC [Human Rights Commission] welcomes the Transitional 
Executive Council's [TEC] decision to abolish Section 29 in 
accordance with the Abolition of Restrictions on Free Political 
Activity Act. 
See attached report for details 
<H3>  A. Formal repression 
Formal repression of persons 
Detention without trial </H3>
  According to the SAP [South African Police], there are 
currently 4 people being held under Section 29 of the Internal 
Security Act (ISA). One person was detained and 9 were released 
under this legislation during the week. On 8 February 1994, the 
Transitional Executive Council took the decision to abolish 
Section 29 in accordance with the Abolition of Restrictions on 
Free Political Activity Act. 
  There are 18 Congress of South African Students (Cosas) and 
Pan Africanist Student Organisation (PASO) members presently 
held under Section 50 (ISA). Among them are the president and 
secretary of Cosas kwaThema branch. 
<H3>  B. Political violence 
General incidents </H3>
  PWV: 9 deaths and 18 injuries - lower than last week's 13 
deaths and 27 injuries. For the third successive week, the death 
toll has decreased from the previous week. Of concern this week 
is Duduza which accounted for 3 deaths and 11 injuries in 13 
incidents. Violence in the township was related to conflict 
between ANC and IFP supporting hostel dwellers from Duduza 
hostel. The hostel is unique in that it houses hostel dwellers 
supporting both the IFP and the ANC and is not divided on ethnic 
lines. Tension in the hostel however was reported to have 
started on 17 February, when IFP supporters from the hostel 
threatened ANC supporters putting up ANC posters in the vicinity 
of the hostel. The violence was allegedly sparked off by an 
attack on 2 Xhosa-speaking hostel dwellers. Following the 
clashes, the township residents came to the assistance of the 
ANC supporters, resulting in an attempt to burn down the hostel. 
Other reports received included IFP supporters forcing residents 
to join the IFP and intimidated residents living in the first 
line of houses opposite the Duduza hostel, to evacuate their 
homes. Allegations of security force collusion were also 
received, isu police allegedly not taking action against IFP 
supporters. 
  In other sub-regions, a female ANC recruitment officer, was 
allegedly harassed by IFP who came to her apartment in 
Johannesburg; 5 youths, including 2 Cosas members, were 
allegedly abducted and assaulted by members of the public, for 
allegedly murdering a taxi owner in Soweto; in Sharpeville, a 
man was killed and a schoolgirl were assaulted allegedly by 
members of the German gang. 
  The township of Bekkersdal recorded 2 deaths as compared to 
last week's toll of 3 deaths and 21 injuries, residents however 
report that the township is tense. 
  Natal: 39 deaths and 32 injuries. Twenty five deaths and 21 
injuries were recorded in the Durban sub-region. Inanda (14 
deaths and 17 injuries) emerged as a focal point of violence in 
the sub-region. This included the massacre of 11 ANC supporters 
in Bhambayi. The massacre toll included the deaths of 3 women, 7 
injuries and 20 homes torched when the ANC-supporting Congo and 
Angola settlements were attacked by a group of alleged IFP 
supporters in a 5 hour attack. The ANC's Natal region alleged 
that a white man was seen by witnesses at the scene of the 
attack, and alleged that ISU [Internal Security Unit] vehicles 
blocked the four entrances to Bhambayi during the attack. In 
Ndwedwe, 5 people, including 4 women, were killed and 2 were 
injured in an attack on a store in the ANC-supporting Sonkombo 
area. Other sub-regions affected were N Natal (6 deaths), N 
Coast (4 deaths, 11 injuries), Midlands (2 deaths) and S Coast 
(2 deaths). In the incidents where the victims could be 
ascertained, 1 death was of an IFP member and 17 deaths and 18 
injuries of ANC members. 
  W Cape: no injuries, 3 incidents. In one incident the 
Milnerton municipal offices were petrol bombed.

Duduza, a young girl was allegedly shot and injured by members

funeral were arrested and later released by members of the ISU 
in kwaThema; 6 youths were arrested and assaulted by members of 
the SADF [South African Defense Force] in Thokoza. 
  Natal: 1 death of an ANC member allegedly shot dead by the 
SAP in Ntuzuma. 
  Bophuthatswana: at least 1 injury, 25 arrests in numerous 
actions by the homeland security forces attempting to curb the 
widespread strike by civil servants and workers, demanding wage 
increases, pension payouts, free political and trade union 
activity in the homeland. Monitors in the area report that at 
the moment action by the security forces is so abundant and 
continuous that not all incidents and casualties are being 
recorded. Incidents reported include: - police using teargas, 
rubber bullets and sjamboks against protesting teachers in 
Ditsobotla - 3 ANC Mafikeng officials arrested after a police 
raid on their homes - police using teargas to disperse workers
