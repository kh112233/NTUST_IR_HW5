FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: British Biotech cancer drug enters last
stage of trials
British Biotech, the UK's biggest biotechnology company, has begun the last
stage of clinical trials on batimastat, its most important drug.
If the trials are successful, the anti-cancer drug will be submitted for
regulatory approval in Europe 'by the end of the first quarter of 1996'.
Approval could follow later that year.
Batimastat's success in earlier trials this year triggered a sharp rise in
the share price. It had risen from 360p at the start of August to 586p
yesterday.
The drug blocks the action of enzymes which allow cancers to grow by
destroying the connective tissue between healthy cells.
This method of treatment differs from conventional drugs, which kill some
healthy cells as well as cancerous ones.
The last stage of testing, Phase III, is the most difficult for any
potential drug. It involves large numbers of patients - 300 for batimastat -
who will be treated in a 'double blind' trial where neither doctor nor
patient knows whether they have received the drug or a placebo. Batimastat
is being tried on patients suffering from abdominal cancers such as ovarian
cancer.
Phase I trials are on healthy volunteers to look for side effects, and Phase
II are on small groups of patients to find the best doses.
Several US biotechnology drugs have failed this year at Phase III.
British Biotech has also started Phase I trials on the follow-up to
batimastat, BB-2516. It is an improvement over batimastat in that it can be
taken orally rather than by injection.
