  [Text] His majesty the king says he has the honor of 
calling for the kind of peace which future generations can 
accept and live with. In a speech he made last night at the 
invitation of the Foreign Affairs Council in Washington, his 
majesty said Jordan is determined to continue the democratic 
process which it is proud of and also seeks to be an example for 
others to follow. 
  His majesty said that the Middle East region has suffered a 
great deal from tension and disputes and that Jordan has always 
sought to attain comprehensive and just peace in this region of 
the world. 
  Speaking about the Middle East peace process, his majesty 
the 
king said he believed that there will be substantial progress on 
all tracks, particularly the Syrian-Israeli track and that this 
progress will take place soon. 
  His majesty called for the resolution of all outstanding 
problems facing the Middle East after which a peace agreement 
would follow. He said he hoped that this point could be reached 
before too long.
