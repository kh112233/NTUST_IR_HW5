ALASKA SPILL AND 'BIG OIL' 
Thank God for Rep. Mel Levine ("Alaska Spill Energizes Vigilance in 
California," Op-Ed Page, May 8) and all your other writers, for keeping the 
horror and devastation of the Valdez oil spill alive and ticking before the 
public eye. Perhaps the public will eventually see what oil industry white lies 
and public apathy can do. 
It makes me disgusted and sad to see the animals, birds, and the marine life 
dying from the oil that was so carelessly spilled. 
It makes me raging mad that Exxon is so irresponsible about cleaning up the 
mess. I'll bet they're right on top of things when getting their oil leases 
from the government. In fact, Exxon action can be real swift. Recently Exxon 
agreed to give $4 million toward a public information campaign to offset the 
effects of the Valdez accident on Alaska's tourism industry. 
When selfish or monetary reasons are at the core, action occurs, doesn't it? 
Thanks to Conrad, too. His cartoon on "Whitewash" (May 8) describes it all to a 
T.
