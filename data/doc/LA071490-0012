PROS AND CONS OVER LEGISLATION TO OPEN ADOPTION RECORDS 
Your scenario of the midnight knock on the door is unduly alarmist. You 
apparently are not familiar with the workings of the adoption process. It is 
highly unlikely that a person in this situation would present him or herself 
unannounced in such a way. It would take much careful thought before making 
even tentative contact with a biological parent or child. 
Four of my children are adopted. We never made it a condition of the adoptions 
that they be secret. In actual fact, in the case of adoptions carried out up to 
1984, there was no way for an adoption to be "open," as the records were 
automatically sealed, regardless of the views of either set of parents. Who is 
to say that many of these families would not have preferred to leave the record 
open in order to facilitate a reunion later in life? Knowing firsthand the 
mental trauma suffered by many adopted children (and, I am sure, by their 
biological parents), I feel that it is only fair to open all the records and 
thus make it easier for reunions to take place. 
It may be true that in earlier decades mothers who relinquished their children 
for adoption were subject to embarrassment because of their situation, but with 
the healthier climate of openness prevailing today it would be a benefit to 
mental health to make it possible for some of these parents and their children 
to allay the ghosts of the past and face reality, even if they are not at 
present aware that this might be a good thing. The idea of keeping adoption 
records secret is a holdover from the days when the adoption was kept a secret 
even from the child, which everyone now agrees was a very unhealthy thing to 
do. 
I submit that it is equally unhealthy and unjust to retain this shroud of 
mystery over a normal fact of life, thus making it difficult and costly for 
adoptive children and parents to find each other.
