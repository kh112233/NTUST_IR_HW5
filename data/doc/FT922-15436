FT  01 APR 92 / Wind farm in Wales orders 103 turbines from Japan
THE commercial exploitation of windpower in the UK took a leap forward
yesterday with the placing of an order for 103 turbines to power a wind farm
in mid-Wales. It will be the second wind farm in the UK and one of the
largest in Europe.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan will supply the turbines for the wind
farm near Llandinam in Powys. The turbines each have an output of 300kw,
giving the installation a total power capacity of 31MW.
The wind farm is being built jointly by Tomen, a Japanese trading house,
EcoGen, a UK company formed in 1990 to bring together a number of interests
working on commercial wind power, and SeaWest, a US company and the world's
largest independent developer of wind farms.
The mid-Wales project is the first of several planned by the three
companies. The project could involve total spending of Y20bn (Pounds 86.6m)
over the next few years.
Mr Tim Kirby, chairman of EcoGen, said: 'We're delighted with the way wind
power has at last hit commercial viability in the UK. We have got a
fantastic resource here and we need clean power.'
EcoGen has been working on identifying a number of UK sites for wind farms.
The order for the turbines follows the winning of planning permission in
February.
Mr Kirby said a site on Anglesey had also come through planning and other
hurdles, and several more sites elsewhere in the UK were at an earlier stage
of development.
It was estimated at the British Wind Energy Conference last week that the UK
would have about 130MW of wind power by the end of next year. The Llandinam
project would represent a quarter of this.
