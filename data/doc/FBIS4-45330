  [Excerpt] Two American drug dealers who distributed huge 
amounts of cocaine throughout Britain for a Colombian cartel 
were each jailed for a total of 16 years yesterday. 
  David Lemieux and Thomas O'Donnell, arrested after the 
world's biggest international drugs-busting operation, were told 
they had contributed to the "problems of addiction, damage to 
health, and poverty and crime". 
  The two men, both 41, who face extradition to the United 
States and the prospect of further jail terms after completing 
their sentences in Britain, had engaged in "very big crime 
indeed", said Judge Brian Pryor QC, passing sentence at Woolwich 
crown court in London. 
  Forty-three kilos of cocaine worth more than &pound;7 
million 
had been seized, he said, but it was likely at least as much 
again was sold after being smuggled into Britain nearly two 
years ago. 
  Almost &pound;2 million was handed over by them to Customs 
and 
Excise undercover men, whom the judge praised for their efforts 
in bringing the men to justice. A further &pound;1.5 million was 
recovered from the homes of the two accused and associates. 
  Mr Lemieux, whose US address was never found, admitted two 
charges of supplying cocaine in the autumn of 1992, two of 
concealing the proceeds of drug trafficking, one of attempting 
to conceal proceeds and one of transferring drug cash out of 
Britain. 
  Mr O'Donnell, whose address in the US is also unknown, 
pleaded guilty to one charge of supply, one of transferring 
drugs money abroad and two of concealing cocaine cash. 
  Also before the court was Briton Howard Edwards, aged 40, 
who 
sailed Mr Lemieux across the Atlantic to the Isle of Wight in 
his yacht in August 1992, so the drugs ring could be launched. 
Thousands of pounds of his part in the pay-off were found at his 
parents' home just outside Merthyr Tydfil, Mid Glamorgan, South 
Wales. 
  He admitted one charge of concealing drug trafficking 
proceeds and was jailed for three years nine months. 
  The judge told the men, none of whom had any previous 
convictions, that he was satisfied that between them they had 
benefited by more than &pound;6 million from their illegal 
activities. 
  Only &pound;960,800 of that was realisable against Mr 
Lemieux 
and he ordered that sum to be confiscated. Mr O'Donnell was told 
he would have to forfeit &pound;536,375 and Mr Edwards 
&pound;90,000. 
  After the case, Ron Harris, assistant chief investigation 
officer for the Customs and Excise drugs financial investigation 
branch, said the international operation had involved eight 
countries. It was the first time so many drug enforcement 
agencies had pooled their resources in a single operation. 
  "It was an unparalleled display of openness," he said. 
"Traditional barriers of `need to know' secrecy were broken 
down, while at the same time preserving the overall integrity of 
the many strands of this operation." [passage omitted]
