  [Excerpts] [Announcer] A deadly stampede occurred yesterday 
in al-Mina [holy site near Mecca] during the stoning of Satan 
[pilgrims throw stones at three idols representing Satan] which 
caused the death of 182 pilgrims. Preliminary reports from our 
our mission in the holy places say that 13 Algerians may be 
among the victims. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Only two. 
  [Announcer] Sorry, only two. [passage omitted 
  At this very moment we have received a correction saying 
that 
the number of Algerian pilgrim victims is only 2 and not 13 as 
we said in the news headlines.
