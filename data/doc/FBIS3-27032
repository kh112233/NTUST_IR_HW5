  [Text] Haikou, February 15 (CNS)--Hainan will boost its 
vast spending on power generation this year with the planned 
capacity of generating sets to be installed put at 400,000 
kilowatts. The tense state regarding power consumption which 
has surfaced throughout the province since the second half of 
last year will then be basically alleviated. 
  A Hainan pivotal project for a hydroelectric power station 
and water conservancy as well as part of the generating sets for 
the Sanya Power Station, all of which are now under 
construction, will go into operation this year. The 
120,000-kilowatt generating set which is kerosene-powered at the 
Haimei Power Station and two 100,000-kilowatt geneating sets at 
the Dongfang Power Plant will be solely funded by foreign 
investors for their construction this year. The kerosene-powered 
generating set installed at the Haimei Power Station is expected 
to go into operation by the end this year. 
  It is expected that construction will start in the first 
half 
of this year on two 125,000-kilowatt generating sets involved in 
the 3d phase expansion of the Haikou Power Plant. Three 
generating sets each with a capacity of 20,000 kilowatts at the 
Gezhen Hydroelectric Station will be under construction sometime 
between late this year and early next year while two 
30,000-kilowatt generating sets at the Basuo Power Plant will be 
constructed late this year. 
  The Hainan authorities also plan to bring in foreign capital 
for exploitation of nuclear power with the selection of a site 
for the first nuclear power station to be completed this year. 
A feasibility study will be carried out for the first-phase 
project which involves a 300,000-kilowatt generating sets.
