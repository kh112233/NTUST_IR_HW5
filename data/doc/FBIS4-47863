  [Text] Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has 
sent a message to Nelson Mandela, president of the African 
National Congress, noting his recent victory in the South 
African general elections, where he won the presidency by a wide 
margin. 
  These elections, the first ones held with the complete 
participation of the population, constitute an event of 
significant importance because they mark the beginning of a new 
era in the political history of South Africa, where the majority 
of the population was repressed by the shameful apartheid regime 
of racial segregation, the message sent by President Chamorro 
said. 
  The Nicaraguan Government, firmly committed to the promotion 
of democratic and human rights, is pleased to salute the efforts 
by the various South African political sectors which made 
changes in that country possible, the Nicaraguan Government note 
observed.
