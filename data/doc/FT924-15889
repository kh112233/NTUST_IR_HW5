FT  02 OCT 92 / World News in Brief: No pardon for Derek Bentley
Derek Bentley, hanged in 1953 at the age of 19 for murdering a policeman,
was refused a posthumous pardon by home secretary Kenneth Clarke. He was
executed after his accomplice, Christopher Craig, shot the officer during a
robbery at a south London factory. Bentley's sister Iris (above), who
campaigned for years to clear her brother's name, said she would fight on.
