FT  01 OCT 92 / World Bank delays Narmada decision
THE World Bank has postponed a decision on changes to the controversial
Narmada dam project in India.
The Dollars 3bn dam and associated canal and drainage works, which will
provide irrigation and drinking water to 30m people in western India, have
been under construction since 1987. But after persistent criticism, the
World Bank last year asked for an independent report.
The report, by Mr Bradford Morse, a former administrator of the United
Nations Development Project, backed many of the objections. He was
especially critical of the inadequate measures to resettle people displaced
by the dam's waters.
The World Bank executive board had been due to meet today to discuss the
action plan produced by Bank staff in the wake of the Morse report, but
directors want more time to consider the proposals.
The board is expected to meet again on October 15.
Some directors want to hear Mr Morse's comments on the Bank's revised plan
before committing themselves.
Mr Morse's support for the new plan would help to deflect much of the
criticism that Bank officials still believe they will receive from
environmental groups.
