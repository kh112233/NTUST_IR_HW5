<F P=106> [Article by Margarita Kornysheva under the rubric "Crime and </F>
the Law": "Until the Chicken Has Its Head Cut Off"] 
  [Text] Here is some information about the drug trade 
obtained from confidential sources. First, not only do 
well-established systems for the delivery and distribution of 
narcotic substances operate in Estonia, but we also have our own 
trained experts who are capable of determining the quality of 
the "merchandise" and pricing it in a highly professional 
manner. Second, there is a "fixation" on the border, where only 
"dupes," random people, get caught. Third, there is a quite well 
developed secrecy system. Fourth, cruel laws apply to the hilt 
within the drug groups--if someone quits the game, or "spills 
the beans," he therefore chooses "eternal rest" somewhere in a 
quarry in Manniku. Fifth, threats against narcotics policemen 
are increasing, and actions against them are quite real. All of 
this is happening against the background of the fact that, in 
the words of the psychiatrist Anti Liiv, "even the revolt in the 
northeastern area of the country is less of a catastrophe for 
the Estonian people than drug addiction." 
<H3>  `A Strange Small State in Which the Drug Problem Is of No 
Concern to Anyone' </H3>
  Doctor Liiv, who at one time practiced in the United States, 
maintains that this is precisely how Americans perceive Estonia. 
  As you will understand, this problem "did not exist" in our 
country until sometime in 1985, just like prostitution, 
corruption, and all manner of other "capitalist ills" "did not 
exist." Finally, they came to their senses and saw that one in 
four apprehended thieves had something to do with drugs (by now, 
one in three criminals commits the crime either intoxicated with 
drugs or in possession of these substances). In short, the 
phenomenon manifested itself sharply. Moreover, compared, for 
example, to the year 1988, which is usually the reference point, 
the phenomenon has grown to a quite respectable size. Data 
quoted by the newspaper ARIPAEV not so long ago show that 
according to the most conservative calculations, each of the 
8,000 uncovered drug addicts spends 200 kroons weekly for the 
poison. The annual volume of the local drug trade comes to at 
least 60 million kroons. How are they to be legalized? We do not 
have a law that hampers money laundering although, in an effort 
to get the endeavor off the ground, representatives of the 
competent organs have visited the West to "collect material" in 
order to offer our legislators the draft of this particular law. 
The republic still does not have a state program for combating 
drug addiction, nor is there a major specialized police unit in 
the scope of whose interests drugs would fall. Who benefits by 
so nicely sweeping under the rug a problem that clearly 
threatens the very life of our society? 
  In the opinion of Anti Liiv, and it is hard to disagree with 
him, the current government benefits. What other explanation is 
there for the fact that Estonia, a UN member, has failed to join 
a single international convention forbidding trafficking in 
narcotic substances? One cannot help wondering, all the more so 
because the last document of this kind that was accepted by the 
international community in 1988, hinders money 
laundering, requiring that commercial secrets which are of 
certain interest be revealed. In view of the absence of a 
coordinating center for drug control, our country has been 
unable to submit information about the domestic drug trade to 
the UN for three years now. 
<H5>  Narcotic Poison in Estonia Is 10 Times Cheaper Than in Europe </H5>
  This is the case on the "black" market. According to 
information obtained from the security police, a five-gram 
package of marijuana and one cubic [centimeter] of liquid opium 
cost 50 kroons, one gram of hashish--no less than 75 kroons, and 
a cubic [centimeter] of a synthetic drug (too weak for 
"professionals")--as little as 25 kroons. Cocaine belongs to a 
class of the most expensive and, apparently, least popular 
"substances" for this reason. It is not cheap in Europe, 
either--a five-gram package fetches $205. 
  At present, drugs of both vegetable origin (marijuana, 
hashish, opium milk) and medicinal origin (diazepam) are common 
in the republic. The former are more common, after all. 
Depending on the specifics of transportation, their form differs 
widely. A drug-sniffing dog "smells" drugs of vegetable origin. 
However, the contrivances of drug dealers may rob it of the 
scent. Previously, drugs were often transported in car bumpers. 
The "merchandise" was placed there, and fresh epoxy resin was 
poured over it. There is no way that a dog would "sniff out" a 
drug in this hiding place for the next three or four days. 
  Opium poppies--quite recently, this combination of words was 
associated solely with Central Asia, and to a lesser degree with 
Ukraine. However, a few years ago it was learned how to grow 
this crop in Estonia and Lithuania out of high-grade seeds 
brought in from Kazakhstan. There are hills with plantations 
between them. They can only be seen from a helicopter, and are 
not visible from the road. The owner harvests, say, one-tenth of 
a hectare, sells the crop, and buys a new house, a horse.... In 
1989 an entire syndicate delivering drugs from Lithuania to us 
was uncovered. Fourteen people ended up in the dock. 
<H5>  The Realm of Transit </H5>
  Poison comes to Estonia from Russia, Lithuania, Central 
Asia, 
and the Caucasus. Luckily we cannot afford Western products. New 
times have resulted in new opportunities for drug sales. The 
transit of drugs through the Baltic area, in particular through 
"us," previously without precedent, at any rate on this scale, 
has become established. 
  Given the actually nonexistent border and the "most 
incorruptible" customs in the world, the organization of 
deliveries is not too exacting an endeavor. Outside groups have 
appeared which have ultimately established themselves solidly 
here. The deep pockets of their members have been helpful in 
securing residence permits or citizenship for them. And how many 
nerves do the common residents of Estonia shatter battling for 
the same?! 
  According to data from the security police, everyone and his 
brother plies the drug trade: The drug business in Estonia is 
controlled by Azeri, Perm, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Riga, and 
Krasnodar groups. For example, the Azeris control the delivery 
of marijuana and hashish, and people from Krasnodar--that of 
both marijuana and opium poppy. A case in which the traffic 
police stopped a new Opel, in whose trunk 10 kilograms of 
marijuana were found, at 1915 on 4 January on the Tartu Highway 
close to the locality of Moega, is characteristic. It was 
learned later that the drug was being transported from the Viru 
section of the border and was controlled by an Azeri "company." 
Most likely they were driving to an out-of-the-way location in 
Harju Rayon. Practitioners are aware of these cases. The 
interested person locates a hamlet with a granny as old as the 
hills: "Here are 100 `greenbacks' for you, go buy yourself a 
goat. In return, put my suitcase away somewhere, and let it sit 
there until needed." The old woman does not care: "Son, toss it 
in the hayloft. I am not pressed for space." 
  All "outsiders" have connections to local "brigades," more 
often than not Russian-speaking, which deliver, for example, 
opium poppies from the areas of the Chu Valley and Issyk-Kul in 
Kyrgyzstan. The pattern is as follows: the south--Estonia--our 
countrymen pick it up, pay for it, and transport it to 
Scandinavia through their own channels. Over there, dealers get 
the "merchandise" and dispose of it "on the spot" (the lion's 
share of narcotic substances remains in the region) or ship it 
on to Europe. 
  According to information from the Department of Police of 
the 
Republic of Estonia, last year more than 100 kilograms of 
various drugs were confiscated in the territory of the republic. 
Specialists believe that this was quite a lot, but they state 
sadly right away: Certainly, more than that went abroad. 
<H5>  The Black Triangle </H5>
  This consists of the suppliers, distributors, and consumers 
of poison. As a rule, those who put drugs in circulation do not 
"get high" themselves. They are more cunning and slippery than 
the usual common criminals. 
  An alarming situation has developed in Tallinn. Police 
functionaries are aware of about 30 apartments in which the 
manufacturing of drug preparations is organized on a large 
scale. According to data of the law enforcement organs, 
gatherings of those fond of smoking or shooting up form 
virtually on every street! Drug addicts are becoming a class. 
Incidentally, there are people among them who are quite high on 
the social ladder. Terrifying reports have been received from 
some schools in the capital city--some students of senior grades 
(but not only them!) become links in the chain of the 
distributors of narcotic substances, almost inevitably getting 
their first taste of the latter. 
  People in the know maintain that so-called "pure" drug 
addicts do not exist in nature. This means that people who have 
become addicted to drugs are prepared to do anything ahead of 
time, driven by the fear of "withdrawal throes" alone. Let us 
say that such a person picks up three or four kilograms of 
"merchandise," keeps one-third, and sells two-thirds. Chasing 
clientele, he would be happy to get anyone and everyone 
"hooked." Be that as it may, this is an income, although there 
is a risk of incurring criminal liability. Of course, they 
steal, too, but the funds procured in this manner are not major. 
  Specialists predict it will not be long before high-capacity 
underground plants for manufacturing drug preparations go on 
line in Estonia. One does not have to be a specialist to duly 
appreciate the exceptionally favorable conditions that bring 
this "bright future" closer. There is nothing standing in the 
way of the time of prosperity coming to the soil of Estonia for 
a business which unfortunately has ranked second after the arms 
trade throughout the world.
