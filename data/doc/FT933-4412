FT  09 SEP 93 / Report warns of long-term threat to energy supplies
WASTE in industrial countries and growing demand in the developing world
pose a long-term threat to energy supplies, says the World Energy Council, a
non-governmental body representing more than 100 countries.
Although world supplies are still abundant, it says governments should take
early action to secure supplies. Growing environmental pressures also
require a drive towards greater energy efficiency.
A study of the long-term prospects for world energy, published in London
today by the council, says present consumption trends could lead to a more
than doubling of energy use by the year 2020. But if strong energy
efficiency measures are instituted, growth could be contained to about 28
per cent over that period, despite a more than 50 per cent increase in world
population.
According to the report, known oil reserves are currently large enough to
last over 40 years, and natural gas over 65 years. Coal reserves are large
enough to last 250 years. But the report doubts that fossil fuels will last
beyond the next century because, as oil and gas run out, the use of coal may
be accelerated sharply.
The WEC believes coal and nuclear power are the two energy sources with
strongest long-term prospects, provided the environmental problems
associated with each can be resolved. But the report urges more rapid
development of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and geothermal.
The report warns that large sums of money will have to be invested in energy
development. The report believes pollution reduction timetables set by
international agreements, for example on carbon dioxide, are unrealistically
tight. Not until the latter part of the next century does it foresee the
level of atmospheric pollution declining.
