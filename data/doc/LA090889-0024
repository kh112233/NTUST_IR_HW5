HEDGECOCK ON LONG LIST OF WITNESSES IN HUNTER FRAUD TRIAL 
Former Mayor Roger Hedgecock is one of 529 potential defense witnesses in the 
fraud and tax evasion trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter, according to a list 
submitted Wednesday to federal court by Hunter's attorneys. 
Although the document, which is not yet part of the official court record, 
lists potential witnesses, Hunter's attorneys have stated several times that 
Hedgecock's testimony is essential to prove that Hunter made a legitimate 
investment when she gave money to the company managing Hedgecock's 1983 mayoral 
campaign. 
U. S. District Court Judge Earl B. Gilliam temporarily released the list to 
reporters Thursday, but the list was recalled after a few moments when defense 
attorney Richard Marmaro saw it in the audience. The list is expected to be 
made public when defense attorneys officially submit the list with all 
supporting paper work, possibly today. 
Also included on the witness list are a number of Hunter's relatives, including 
her son, George, who was excluded from the courtroom Thursday, and many figures 
associated with J. David &amp; Co. 
The potentially large number of witnesses will be used by Hunter's attorneys to 
defend her against prosecutors' allegations that she participated in the J. 
David Ponzi scheme.
