FT  04 MAY 94 / EU clears Pounds 61m aid for Ulster factory
Government plans to contribute Pounds 61m to the Pounds 157m cost of a
textile plant in Northern Ireland received European Union clearance last
night. It will be built by the Taiwanese Hualon Corporation on the outskirts
of Belfast and may lead to the creation of 2,000 jobs.
The European Commission said last night that the state aid on offer to the
plant, which will produce more than 20,000 tonnes of fabric a year, would
affect trading conditions in the EU. But the impact would not be 'to an
extent contrary to the common interest'.
Mr Karel Van Miert, the commissioner responsible for competition law, said
the project was of prime importance for a region particularly hit by
unemployment.
