  [Text] Eduardo dos Santos continues to display his 
murderous wrath against innocent civilians in Bengo Province. 
On 1 and 2 March, Cuban, South African, and Katanguese 
mercenaries, in the service of the Futungo de Belas Palace, once 
again shelled civilians, using long- and medium-range 
self-propelled artillery. The mercenaries shelled the villages 
of Catota and Batuqueiro, on the outskirts of Nambuangongo, 
causing heavy casualties. 
  Kandimba Kavava, health director in the region, told our 
correspondent Octavio Mulangui that 13 civilians, including 
children, women and old people, were killed in the attack, while 
about 48 civilians were seriously wounded. 
  What is more, the mercenaries destroyed the local hospital 
and 12 civilian houses. The wounded have been admitted to 
Nambuangongo Central Hospital where they are receiving medical 
assistance. More than one-third of them have been seriously 
wounded by Soviet BM-21 rockets.
