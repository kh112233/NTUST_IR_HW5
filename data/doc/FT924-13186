FT  16 OCT 92 / Technology: Testing time for fibres
New genetic tests to determine the origins of natural materials, including
fibres, timber and meat, are being developed at the British Textile
Technology Group.
The BTTG tests could have far-reaching implications for activities ranging
from clothes retailing to the control of trade in endangered species.
The research started with the aim of finding a new way to distinguish
between different fibres in clothing materials, which would be faster and
more reliable than traditional examination by microscope. The textile
industry needs such a test to detect the adulteration of expensive animal
fibres like cashmere and mohair with cheaper wools.
BTTG scientists have discovered how to extract the small amounts of DNA
present in processed fibres and then identify the species from which it
comes. They are now developing a kit which will for the first time enable
textile buyers to check quickly and accurately whether a particular fabric
matches its specification.
At the same time BTTG's Manchester and Leeds laboratories are working to
extend genetic testing to a much wider range of natural materials.
One potential application is in the food industry, to test the origin of
meat products. An inspector or buyer could then tell immediately whether a
sausage contained the correct amount of pork, beef or venison  - and had not
been adulterated with kangaroo or horse meat.
BTTG sees the timber trade as another outlet. The genetic test could
distinguish between woods which are difficult to tell apart with
conventional methods.
The technology also has forensic applications which would supplement the
well-known role of human gene tests in rape and murder cases. For example,
DNA analysis of stomach contents might identify a murder victim's last meal.
And a single fibre at the scene of a crime could provide evidence about the
clothing worn by a murderer.
