CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SOMIS; 
8 AT RANCH ACCUSED UNDER SLAVERY LAW 
A federal grand jury in Los Angeles charged a Somis flower rancher, six foremen 
and an alleged smuggler with enslaving more than 100 Mexican laborers, forcing 
them to work for sub-minimum wages and selling them food and sundries at 
inflated prices from a company store. The defendants, including Edwin M. Ives, 
54, owner of the ranch in Ventura County, face up to 52 years in prison and $2 
million in fines if convicted, according to federal prosecutors. 
All eight defendants are charged with violating a variety of labor and civil 
rights laws, including a federal criminal anti-slavery statute, said Assistant 
U.S. Atty. Carol Gillam. She said the indictments represent only the second 
time the 81-year-old law has been used in Southern California. "This is a very 
significant case that involves very serious violations of people's human 
rights," Gillam said.
