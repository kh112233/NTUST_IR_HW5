  [Text] It has transpired that the Tajikistan authorities 
are preparing to try four Tajik journalists who have spent 14 
months in a Dushanbe prison on charges of "calling for the 
overthrow of Soviet power." Mirbobo Mirrakhimov, former 
chairman of the State Committee for Television and Radio and a 
candidate of historical sciences, was arrested on 8 January in 
Ashkhabad [Ashgabat]; Akhmadsho Komilov, former Dushanbe 
television studio director, and television analysts Khurshed 
Nazarov and Khayriddin Kosimov were arrested at the same time in 
the Kyrgyz city of Osh. Eduard Sagalayev, chairman of the 
International Confederation of Journalists Unions, and Aleksey 
Simonov, chairman of the Fund for the Protection of Glasnost, 
have signed an appeal to the CIS heads of state, pointing to the 
dubious criminal charges being pressed against the journalists. 
  A few weeks ago, head of government Abdudzhalil Samadov 
promised that he would see to it that the arbitrary action would 
be stopped, but the promise has gone unfulfilled. The appeal 
calls on the CIS heads of state to help alleviate the 
journalists' predicament and to hold open court hearings as soon 
as possible to be attended by international observers.
