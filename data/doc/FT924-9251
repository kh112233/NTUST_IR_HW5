FT  06 NOV 92 / Technology: More ammunition in malaria battle - Worth
Watching
A blue-green herb known by the Chinese for nearly 2,000 years to hold the
key to treating malaria is giving up its secrets to modern medicine, thanks
to collaboration between Chinese and Australian researchers.
Two University of Sydney researchers, Richard Haynes and Simone Vonwiller,
have devised a chemical process that promises to boost significantly the
production of the anti-malarial drug derived from the qinghao plant
(Artemisia annua).
It uses qinghao acid, a more abundant precursor of the plant's active
compound, qinghaosu, to produce three to four times the quantity of
anti-malaria compound that would be synthesised by nature in the equivalent
number of plants.
The process is being developed by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer with the university
and the Kunming Pharmaceutical Factory in China. Sydney University
