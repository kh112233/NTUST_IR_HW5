FT  11 MAY 92 / Victory for Rafsanjani
SUPPORTERS of Iran's pragmatic President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani have
won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections, routing radicals who had
opposed economic reforms and a gradual opening to the west.
In Friday's second round of balloting, candidates with the president's
backing achieved a virtual clean sweep in the crucial Tehran area, which
contributes 30 representatives to the 270-member majlis (parliament).
Candidates sympathetic to Mr Rafsanjani's relatively moderate policies were
also successful in provincial areas.
About three quarters of the parliamentarians are expected to be Rafsanjani
supporters. Counting is expected to be completed early this week.
Mr Rafsanjani is an advocate of economic liberalisation, while his opponents
favour continuing state control and a programme of subsidies to protect the
living standards of the poor.
Mr Mohammed Javid Larijani, foreign policy adviser to Mr Rafsanjani, and Mr
Rajai Khorassani, Iran's former United Nations representative, were among
the moderates elected.
Both Iranian and western observers are describing the result as a slap in
the face for the militants who have presented themselves as the true heirs
to the radical line of Iran's late spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini.
