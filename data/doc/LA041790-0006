GASOLINE TAX 
I have always found the Reagan and Bush administrations' inability to logically 
distinguish between a tax and a user fee to be hilarious, in a sad and cynical 
sort of way. Apparently, if a Democrat wants to raise revenues, it's a tax. If 
a Republican wants to raise revenues, it's a user fee.
