FT  23 SEP 94 / Bristol freight link to tunnel
Outline planning consent has been given for a private rail terminal at
Avonmouth, near Bristol, which will provide the west of England with direct
freight services to the Channel tunnel.
The terminal, costing about Pounds 50m in its first phase, will be built on
107 acres of land owned by Western Properties, part of RTZ, the mining
group.
The development is likely to be in the form of a joint venture and the
terminal will be operated by Bristol Port Company, which runs the nearby
docks.
West of England companies have been concerned at the lack of direct freight
services to the Channel tunnel. Their nearest intermodal terminal - one able
to handle freight arriving by road or rail - for European services would
otherwise be at Cardiff. Railtrack said yesterday: 'With this terminal
Bristol will become the west country's freight centre for the Channel
tunnel.'
RTZ ceased industrial operations at Avonmouth several years ago, but still
owns 400 acres there. Part of the land has been contaminated since munitions
work during the first world war.
The terminal will be close to the M5 motorway and the second Severn
crossing, due to open in early 1996. It will connect with the railway line
between Avonmouth and Bristol Parkway, on which Railtrack has just completed
a Pounds 50m programme of improvements.
Bristol Port Company said the terminal would have 500,000 sq ft of storage
and industrial space. It hoped some freight operations could start next
year.
