MORNING REPORT: ART 
Extra! Extra! Reporters Stage Art Theft!: Two journalists for a daily French 
newspaper stole a drawing by Jean Auguste Ingres from a museum in southern 
France in broad daylight to test security a week after three thefts from 
museums in Paris, the reporters' newspaper says. The Midi Libre, a regional 
daily in Montpellier, said Wednesday that reporter Odile Cimitiere and 
photographer Pierre Carriere removed the small tableau from a wall in the Fabre 
Museum with a screwdriver, then hid the sketch in a plastic bag under one's 
clothing and spirited it out the museum's entrance unchallenged Tuesday 
morning. They returned it to museum authorities later. GREG BRAXTON
