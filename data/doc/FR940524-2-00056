Importation of Exotic Wild Birds to the United States; Implementation of the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.



Action: 

Notice.

 


Summary:

 A recent district court order has declared invalid certain portions of the Fish and Wildlife Service's regulations
implementing the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (WBCA). On March 29, 1994, District Judge Oberdorfer ruled that
50 CFR 15.11(b)(2) and the final sentence of 15.11(c) [which were promulgated by the Service as part of the final
rule published on November 16, 1993, 58 FR 60524], violate the language of the WBCA because those regulatory sanctions
purported to exclude from the coverage of the automatic import moratorium those exotic birds listed on appendix III
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) that did not originate in the country or countries
that listed them in appendix III. Therefore, in keeping with the district court order, the Service announces that
all exotic birds listed on CITES appendix III are covered by the automatic import moratorium of the WBCA, regardless
of their country of origin. Future rule-making notices will delete the regulatory provisions that were invalidated
by the court order.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 23, 1992 the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA) was signed into law, the purposes of which include promoting
the conservation of exotic birds by: Ensuring that all imports into the United States of species of exotic birds are
biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject to inhumane
treatment during capture and transport; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs in countries
of origin. On November 16, 1993 the Service published a final rule in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60524) which implemented the prohibitions stipulated in the WBCA and provided permit requirements and procedures
for some allowed exemptions. This final rule finalized the proposed rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 12, 1993 (58 FR 42926) with some modifications based on comments received and further analysis by the Service.
This notice serves to announce that the Service will propose to amend 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c)_Prohibitions, of the
final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 16, 1993. 


In the final rule of November 16, 1993, the Service interpreted that appendix III species are considered CITES-listed
species for the purposes of these regulations only if they originate in the country that listed them in appendix III.
The Service noted that the listing of a species in appendix III is a unilateral action by a particular CITES Party, thereby
requiring CITES permits and implementation of CITES permits issuance requirements for that country only; when the
species is found in other countries that did not list it in appendix III, only a certificate of origin is required, stating
that it did not originate in the country that listed the species in appendix III. Therefore, when the species is found
in countries other than where listed in appendix III, it is not subject to the same level of CITES controls, and indeed
is only listed in the appendices to assist the listing state in implementing its domestic legislation. Based on its
understanding of the intent of Congress, the Service implemented a final rule whereby appendix III species were subject
to the automatic import prohibitions of the law, if they originated in the listing country. Otherwise, they would
be subject to the discretionary prohibitions of the law. 
The Humane Society of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife brought a civil action against the Secretary of the
Interior in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging that part of 15.11 which
restricts the importation of certain appendix III exotic birds. 

Humane Society of the United States 

v. 

Babbitt, 

Civ. No. 940296 (D.D.C., Mar. 29, 1994). A hearing in District Court took place on March 7, 1994. Plaintiffs
argued that this provision, which was adopted through notice and comment procedures, violates the language of the
Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992. They sought relief to suspend or invalidate the following exception, contained
in the final rule, to the prohibition on importation of birds listed in the Convention's appendices: ``This paragraph
(b) does not apply to an exotic bird species listed in appendix III to the Convention that originated in a country that
has not listed the species in appendix III'' (50 CFR 15.11 (b) (2)). Plaintiffs argued that this provision violates
the plain language of the Act, which bars the importation of ``any'' species listed in ``any'' appendix to the Convention.

On March 29, 1994 U.S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer found the contested regulation to be invalid. Therefore,
effective immediately, no birds listed in CITES appendix III can be imported into the United States unless they are
accompanied by an import permit or are on an approved list, pursuant to 50 CFR part 15. 
In a future notice, the Service will propose to amend 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c) consistent with the declaration in the
Court Order. The Service will propose that all exotic bird species listed in CITES appendix III (in addition to those
in I or II), wherever found, cannot be imported into the U.S. unless accompanied by an import permit issued pursuant
to subpart C of 50 CFR part 15 or are included in an approved list. On March 17, 1994 the Service published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 12784) a proposed rule establishing those approved lists.
