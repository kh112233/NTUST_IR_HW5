FT  04 NOV 94 / Falklands flights 'unlikely'
Britain's Civil Aviation Authority is 'unlikely' to grant permission for a
weekly flight between Uruguay and the disputed Falkland Islands because of
concern over safety standards, according to Mr Roger James, deputy head of
mission at the British embassy in Montevideo.
Air Atlantic Uruguay ran its inaugural four-hour flight, in a converted
Hercules 130 leased from the Uruguayan air force, in September, but has
since been refused permission to fly. 'The problem is the use of a military
plane for a civilian flight,' said Mr James. 'At the moment things are stuck
but we are trying to resolve the issue.'
In principle, the British are keen to see more flights to the Falklands,
which since the British-Argentine conflict of 1982 have been practically cut
off from the Latin American mainland. The Air Atlantic flight, whose maiden
trip brought fresh fruit and other rarities to the isolated South Atlantic
islands, was the first of its kind since the war.
