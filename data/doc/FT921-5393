FT  04 MAR 92 / Libya takes Lockerbie row to international court
LIBYA yesterday asked the International Court of Justice in The Hague to
intervene in its dispute with the US and Britain over their demand for
extradition of the alleged Lockerbie bombers.
The Libyan ambassador to Brussels and The Hague, Mr Mohammed Sharaf Eddine
El Faitouri, said he had delivered an 'official complaint' to the court.
Libya's mission at the UN said it was asking the court to resolve the
dispute and to take 'appropriate interim action' regarding the extradition
case.
The US and Britain have threatened reprisals against Libya unless it hands
over two men accused of the bombing.
Britain last night described the Libyan move as 'extraordinary', but said it
would co-operate if the court decided to consider the application.
Meanwhile, Britain said President Muammer Gadaffi's claim to have broken
links with the Irish Republican Army 'falls far short' of demands that Libya
renounce backing for terrorism. Words alone were not enough, officials said.
