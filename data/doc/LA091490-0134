Gunman's Sons Sue Prozac Maker: The sons of a Kentucky man who killed eight 
others and himself last year sued Eli Lilly &amp; Co., maker of an 
anti-depressant drug that their father was taking. The suit in Jefferson County 
Circuit Court contended that Prozac, touted as the "wonder drug" of the 1990s, 
triggered Joseph Wesbecker's shooting spree. "Mr. Wesbecker had a lengthy 
history of psychiatric disturbance, including suicidal attempts and homicidal 
threats, prior to taking Prozac," said Ed West of Indianapolis-based Lilly.
