FT  28 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Convention to hold hearing in
public - Scottish Devolution
THE Scottish Constitutional Convention, which has drawn up detailed plans
for a Scottish parliament, will today publicly debate one of its most
contentious issues, the system by which the parliament's members will be
elected.
The convention, which includes Labour and the Liberal Democrats but is
boycotted by the Conservatives and the Scottish National Party, has not held
a full-scale meeting since it concluded its outline proposals in late 1990.
Although the convention's executive committee and working groups have since
met regularly, the issue of a devolved Scottish parliament received little
exposure last year.
This may have contributed to the rise in support for outright independence.
An opinion poll last month indicated that 50 per cent of Scots favoured
independence.
Labour is prepared to accept a version of the additional member system for
elections to the parliament under which two MPs would be elected in each of
the 72 Scottish parliamentary constituencies and further members from party
lists. Support for the Scottish National Party stands at 28 per cent, two
points up on last month, according to a System Three poll for The Herald
newspaper in Glasgow.
Labour remains at 38 per cent, the Tories are down one point to 22 per cent
and the Liberal Democrats are at 10 per cent.
The government would face a 'constitutional crisis' if it ignored demands
for devolution, Mr Keith Raffan, Tory MP for Delyn, warned during the
Commons' annual debate on Welsh affairs. He said: 'Devolution is not the
means to sap or repair but the way to safeguard and consolidate unity.'
