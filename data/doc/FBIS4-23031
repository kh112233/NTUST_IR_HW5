  [Abstract] A lack of data on the efficacy of 
phosphomycin--a phosphonic acid group antibiotic with a 
bactericide effect against the Escherichia coli, Proteus 
mirabilis, Psedomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Shigella 
spp., Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholerae, etc., 
strains--prompted a study of the efficacy of this drug and its 
combinations with other antibiotics in treating experimental 
plague in albino mice. To this end, mice were infected 
subcutaneously with a 1,250 LD[.sub]50[/] dose of the 
suspension of day-old Yersinia pestis 231 agar 
culture. Phosphomycin was injected 24 h after infection once a 
day for seven days in the amount of 2, 4, 8, and 16 g per mouse. 
The efficacy of the single antibiotic and its combinations with 
amikacin or cefotaxime was assessed using deliberately 
inadequate doses. In addition, phosphomycin and amikacin was 
administered alternately for four days. The efficacy of combined 
application of phosphomycin and amikacin or cefotaxime for 
experimental plague treatment in albino mice is summarized. The 
experiment reveals that phosphomycin is a highly efficient 
preparation for treating experimental plague in albino mice and 
demonstrates the possibility of its combined use with either of 
the two other antibiotics. Tables 1; references 10: 3 Russian, 7
