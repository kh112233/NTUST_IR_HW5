FT  27 JUL 93 / Kurd rebels set kidnap terms
Kurdish rebels said yesterday they would release six kidnapped foreign
tourists if Turkey stopped military operations against them in the
southeast, Reuters reports. The Dusseldorf-based Kurd-Ha news agency, which
is close to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), quoted guerrilla sources as
saying the four Frenchmen, a Briton and an Australian were their 'guests'
and were not being ill-treated.
It said the rebels had also seized a Turkish policeman and a soldier from
another vehicle on the same road. The PKK abducted two other tourists from
the Tatvan area on July 4.
