JEWELRY STORE ROBBED; 2 MEN CAUGHT, 1 SHOT 
Burbank police chased down two men Saturday afternoon suspected of robbing a 
Burbank jewelry store early in the afternoon, but a third suspect, who 
authorities said was shot by an officer while attempting to escape, was still 
missing. 
Burbank Police Lt. Larry Koch said that Krause Jewelers, located at 101 N. 
Victory Boulevard, was robbed by three men armed with a handgun at about 1:40 
p.m. Saturday. 
Store employees phoned police while the men were still in the store, but the 
three robbers fled from the store and into a waiting automobile as police 
arrived, Koch said. 
Police chased the car, but after about a mile the suspects got out and started 
running. Using dogs and a helicopter, officers chased and arrested two men, but 
they were still looking for a third. The names of the suspects in custody were 
not released. 
Police believe the third man was hit by an officer who fired one shot at him.
