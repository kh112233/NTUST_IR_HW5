<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its intention to accept and consider an application for the award
of a grant with time constraints to the American Drug Development, Inc. (ADD). The purpose of the grant is to provide
the orphan drug, Sodium Phenylbutyrate, to children with three urea cycle disorders (deficiencies of carbamyl phosphate
synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), and argininosuccinic acid synthetase) which, if not treated, are
fatal to the patient. Competition is limited to ADD because ADD is the entity currently able to manufacture and supply
Sodium Phenylbutyrate for the treatment of these disorders. ADD is also in the process of compiling documentation
which will be submitted to FDA for approval of a new drug application (NDA) for Sodium Phenylbutyrate. Until the NDA
is approved, this drug is not available to patients by any other means other than through a grant to ADD.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is announcing its intention to accept and consider an application for the award of a grant with time constraints
to ADD, Baltimore, MD. FDA's authority to enter into grants for the development of drugs for rare diseases and conditions
is set out in Section 5 of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee). FDA's research program is described in the Catalog of
Federal Domestic Assistance No. 93.103. Before entering into grants, FDA carefully considers the benefits that
such grants will provide to the public.


ADD's application will undergo a peer review in accordance with the Public Health Service policies and procedures
governing the review of grant applications with time constraints.


I. Background 


For the past 8 years, FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development (OPD) has funded a clinical research grant for the
treatment of urea cycle disorders with Sodium Phenylbutyrate. This grant expires September 30, 1994. Due to the life-threatening
nature of urea cycle disorders, it is necessary to have a 3-month supply of the drug on hand in case possible problems
in the purity and/or availability of the drug arise. For this reason, more drugs must be ordered by September 15, 1994,
to ensure an adequate drug supply. ADD is able to immediately manufacture and supply the drug for the treatment of these
disorders.


II. Mechanism of Support


A. Award Instrument


Support will be in the form of a grant. In 1994, the FDA estimate for this grant award is $ 750,000 (final amount will be
negotiated). The award will be subject to all policies and requirements that govern the research grant programs of
the Public Health Service (PHS), including the provision of 42 CFR part 52, 45 CFR part 74, and the PHS grants policy
statement.


B. Length of Support


The length of support may be for 24 months with no possibility of additional noncompetitive support. 


III. Reasons for Award With Time Constraints


FDA believes that there is a compelling need to award a grant to ADD based on time constraints because these urea cycle
disorders are fatal if untreated. Also, FDA believes that ADD is uniquely qualified to fulfill the objectives of the
proposed grant because it is able to immediately manufacture and supply Sodium Phenylbutyrate.


IV. Reporting Requirements


Program progress reports and financial status reports will be required annually, based on the date of award. These
reports will be due within 30 days after the end of the budget period. A final program progress report and financial
status report will be due 90 days after expiration of the project period of the grant.


V. Smoke-Free Workplace


PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco
products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American
people.
