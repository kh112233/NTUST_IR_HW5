FT  17 FEB 93 / Letter: Policy aims to minimise weapons destruction
Sir, In his excellent article 'A disarming achievement' (February 12), David
White comments: 'Surplus armoured vehicles, artillery weapons and aircraft
covered by the terms of CFE have to be destroyed in the next three years.'
This is correct, but hides the fact that Nato is using every means at its
disposal to minimise the numbers of weapons to be destroyed. Under the
policy known as 'Cascade', Nato countries whose forces exceed the CFE
treaty-limited equipment (TLE) quotas pass on, free of charge, their surplus
weapons to Nato countries with sub-TLE forces. The beneficiaries of this
policy have thus far been Greece and Turkey: 916 tanks, 150 armoured combat
vehicles, 72 artillery systems and 100 mortar systems cascading into Greece;
and 1,057 tanks, 600 armoured combat vehicles and 71 artillery systems
cascading into Turkey. This represents a massive modernisation of these
nations' forces at the time when every thoughtful analyst fears they may be
dragged into war with each other over Macedonia and Kosovo.
Responding to these fears, the UK defence secretary, Malcolm Rifkind wrote,
in a letter to Basic: 'I do not see that the tragic events in the former
Yugoslavia provide a reason to change the rationale for the programme.'
These words may well come back to haunt him.
Cascade, however, is indicative rather than exceptional. Germany is
assisting in a rearmament of Hungary. No one in NATO seems to believe these
policies are problematic, though concern is voiced when the former Soviet
Union states do the same thing.
The scale of these Nato-blessed arms transfers far outweighs, and flatly
contradicts, any tentative positive steps towards peace-keeping recently
made by the alliance.
