FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Tabacalera looks abroad for
expansion targets
Tabacalera, the Spanish tobacco group, said it was actively looking at
several overseas markets to identify expansion opportunities, Reuter reports
from Madrid.
'We are looking at the fastest growing markets which would be the most
interesting for us,' said Mr Calixto Rios, financial director, announcing a
104 per cent improvement in group nine-month pre-tax profits.
It set up a joint venture this year with ZPT Radom in Poland, where it
produces its new Winns brand. Cigarette consumption in Spain is falling by
0.7-1.0 per cent a year, he said. Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia,
however, offer potential for growth.
The group's nine-month pre-tax profits rose to Pta13.05bn (Dollars 106m)
from Pta6.4bn in the same period last year, as sales of premium brands rose
due to a crackdown on smuggling. Costs fell as a result of lay-offs. Group
net sales rose to Pta535.77bn from Pta456.3bn.
Sales of the top of the range Philip Morris and Reynolds brands, such as
Marlboro and Winston, which Tabacalera makes under licence, were
particularly buoyant. These are the types most popular with smugglers.
'The results have evolved very much in line with expectations. We hope the
final quarter will be similar and we are sticking to our original
forecasts,' Mr Rios said.
The company expects to cut the workforce by 750 people, or nearly 9 per
cent, by the end of the year.
