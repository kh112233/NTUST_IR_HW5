  [Text] Tokyo Gas Co. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. 
have jointly developed what they claim is the first fuel cell 
that utilizes city gas made from the liquified natural gas, 
instead of hydrogen, as fuel. 
  The companies have already succeeded in generating 5 kW of 
electricity with the fuel cell. The solid-macromolecule-type 
fuel cell can generate electricity more effectively than other 
types, the company officials said. 
  The key technology of the fuel cell is a newly developed 
device that extracts pure hydrogen from city gas with thin 
palladium films. The companies plan to continue testing the fuel 
cell until 1996, and are expected to commercialize it early next 
century. 
  Fuel cells are expected to serve as future electricity 
generators in urban areas because they produce less nitrogen 
oxide, noise and vibrations.
