FOREIGN VISITORS TO U.S. SPEND $20 BILLION IN FIRST HALF OF '89 
Foreign visitors to the United States spent $20 billion in the first six months 
of this year, 19% more than during the same period in 1988, a Commerce 
Department official said today. 
Based on projections for the rest of 1989, the United States should have a 
travel trade surplus of almost $1.2 billion, marking the first time it will 
have posted a full year of gains. 
Rockwell Schnabel, undersecretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism, said the 
agency's data were compiled from a survey of air travelers from the U.S. Travel 
and Tourism Administration. 
The data show that foreign visitors spent more money in the United States than 
Americans spent abroad ($19.9 billion) by almost $118 million in the first six 
months of 1989. 
Japan tourists topped the list by spending nearly $2.7 billion, an increase of 
19% from the same period in 1988, followed by Canada ($2.5 billion) and Mexico 
($1.5 billion). 
The United States reported travel surpluses of $2.6 billion with Japan and $1.4 
billion with Canada.
