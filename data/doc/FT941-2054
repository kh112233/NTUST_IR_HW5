FT  23 MAR 94 / Drugs groups slow R&amp;D investment
The growth of investment in pharmaceuticals research and development
decelerated steeply last year, because of health care reforms and efforts to
cut spending on medicines.
The world's top 38 companies that have so far reported their results
increased their R &amp; D expenditure by only 9.6 per cent last year. That
compares with industry growth rate during the 1980s of between 16 and 20 per
cent.
The investment slow down follows industry warnings that R &amp; D spending was
unsustainable because of government intervention to control drugs prices and
consumption. Pharmaceutical groups have been struggling with poor growth
rates in the world's most important medicines markets. The increase in drug
sales in the top seven European market declined from 8 per cent in 1992 to
only 1 per cent last year.
Most drugs groups have responded by cutting marketing and administrative
overheads for the last two years. None had previously dared cut R&amp;D, viewed
as the life-blood of the industry.
But last year, among the top 38 pharmaceuticals groups, five companies
(three in the US, one in Europe and one in Japan) were forced to reduce
expenditure. They included Monsanto, Marion Merrell Dow and Parke Davis of
the US, Ares Serono of Switzerland, and Shionogi in Japan.
Dr Leon Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research
Institute, warned: 'The heady days of R&amp;D are over.' Between 1981 and 1993,
pharmaceuticals R&amp;D spending rose from Dollars 5.4bn (Pounds 3.2bn) in 1981
to Dollars 26.5bn, according to the UK-based Centre for Medicines Research.
'Although the immediate effects will be limited because of the time it takes
to develop new medicines, in the longer term the flow of innovative
medicines is being threatened,' Mr Bryan Wright, representative in Japan of
the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, said.
European companies appear to have been less affected than their US
counterparts. The top-10 European groups that have so far reported figures
increased their R&amp;D spending by an average of 15.4 per cent from Dollars
6.09bn in 1992 to Dollars 7.1bn last year. They spent, on average, 16.9 per
cent of sales on R&amp;D. Groups whose spending rose the most included Wellcome
(30.6 per cent), Glaxo (24.2 per cent), and SmithKline Beecham (20.2 per
cent).
The top 10 US groups increased their R&amp;D spending 8.8 per cent from Dollars
7.85bn last year to Dollars 8.5bn. On average, they invested 11.2 per cent
of their turnover in R&amp;D. The top five Japanese companies raised their
spending only 6.6 per cent from Dollars 1.78bn to Dollars 1.9bn, investing
11.4 per cent of their sales.
Those groups spending least have been most hit by the reforms. Among the
lower-level spenders of the top 38 companies, R&amp;D spending increased only
5.1 per cent.
The US figures follow a warning by the American Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers' Association that its members expect to increase R&amp;D spending
only 9.4 per cent this year, the first single-digit increase since 1977.
That compares with average annual growth of 16 per cent between 1980 and
1992. About 20 member companies forecast their R&amp;D investment growth rate
would fall during 1994.
