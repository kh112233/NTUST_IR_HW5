  [Text] Tallinn, February 4 -- Estonian Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Juri Luik, after signing the Partnership for Peace 
Programme in Brussels, on Thursday [3 February], arrived at a 
one-day official visit to Finland, on Friday. 
  Luik met Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho, with whom he 
discussed Estonian-Finnish economic relations and Finnish 
President Mauno Koivisto. Luik had a longer meeting with his 
Finnish counterpart Heikki Haavisto. Under discussion were 
bilateral and international relations, agreements, juridical and 
economic issues. Minister Luik also explained the background of 
joining the Partnership for Peace programme. 
  Luik gave a press conference in Helsinki, on Friday, where 
he 
said that besides signing the Partnership for Peace programme he 
also met Foreign Relations Commissioner of the European Union 
Hans van der Broek in Brussels, with whom he reached an 
agreement that concluding free trade agreement between Estonia 
and European Union should be on the agenda this summer. 
  Commenting on the Partnership for Peace Programme Luik said 
that the direct importance of the agreement lied in the fact 
that "NATO was not indifferent towards Estonia". Estonia needs 
help in development of defence forces, juridical questions and 
formation of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and in these 
areas NATO is ready to support Estonia, he added. 
  Luik said that Estonia will apply for full membership of 
NATO 
when "time was rife" for it. The three Baltic states will 
cooperate on the issue, and will apply for the membership 
together, Luik said. 
  Luik arrived back to Estonia Friday evening.
