HOMELESS VETERANS IN 10TH DAY OF HUNGER STRIKE 
Two homeless veterans living in the nation's first shelter exclusively for 
military veterans Wednesday entered the 10th day of a hunger strike to protest 
what they call "dictatorial" management at the Queens facility. 
Earl Bettoe and Benjamin Colon, whose protest is supported by many of the 400 
veterans at the Borden Avenue Veterans Residence, told reporters that they 
started their fast after shelter managers warned them that they would lose 
their beds if they left for Christmas visits with their families. 
"Most of us are combat vets, and we are treated like children," said Colon, 36, 
leaning unsteadily on the cane he said he has carried since he was injured in 
Vietnam. "We want jobs, we want apartments, we want a place we can be with our 
children. This place doesn't help you get none of those." 
The veterans phoned the New York Civil Liberties Union, which has taken up 
their cause and arranged for negotiations with the Salvation Army employees who 
run the shelter under contract with New York City. 
Residents at the 2-year-old shelter, which has drawn inquiries from officials 
contemplating similar projects nationally, are demanding more medical care and 
assistance in finding jobs and permanent housing, and an easing of restrictions 
such as the 10 p.m. curfew. 
Alfred J. Peck, a Vietnam veteran hired by the Salvation Army to run the 
$4.2-million facility, said 80% of the shelter's clients are found to be drug 
or alcohol abusers and that 20% suffer some form of mental illness. The 
shelter's strict rules, he said, are "a motivator" to help the men learn 
responsibility.
