FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bond losses and R&amp;D costs take
toll on Hafslund
Hafslund Nycomed, the Norwegian pharmaceuticals and energy group, saw
first-half pre-tax profits fall to NKr651m (Dollars 92m) from NKr782m after
bond losses and higher research and development costs.
However, the group is sticking to an earlier forecast that pre-tax profits
for the full year would match last year's NKr1.57bn.
This is in spite of the threat of higher interest costs in the second half,
following the group's June decision to buy the diagnostic imaging business
of US-based Sterling Winthrop for Dollars 450m. The acquisition will make
Hafslund the world leader in the diagnostic imaging field.
The deterioration in the group's financial performance was the main reason
for the first-half downturn, although operating profits were slightly lower,
at NKr728m compared with NKr741m.
There was a net financial loss for the period of NKr73m, after a NKr42m gain
in 1993. Losses on bonds restricted overall income on the company's
securities portfolio to NKr3m, down from NKr115m in 1993.
Operating revenues rose to NKr3.50bn from NKr3.15bn, while operating profit
before before research and development costs was NKr1.11bn, against
NKr1.10bn. Research and development rose to NKr386m from NKr361m.
Nycomed Imaging saw operating profits before research costs fall to NKr736m
from NKr806m, as revenues tumbled to NKr1.21bn from NKr1.28bn. Bulk sales of
iohexol to licensees were 15 per cent lower, due to cyclical variations in
sales patterns and general price pressure in the US.
By contrast, there was a strong performance from Nycomed Pharma, where
operating profits before research and development costs rose to NKr305m from
NKr241m, helped by cost-cutting.
Hafslund Energi, benefiting from higher trading activity, increased
operating profits to NKr116m from NKr108m.
