FT  21 MAR 94 / Kurds riot as Germans ban rally
About 6,000 militant Kurds went on the rampage over the weekend in the
southern German town of Augsburg and on a nearby motorway, after authorities
had barred them from holding a rally which had been declared illegal, police
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Augsburg.
They said 85 police officers and two firemen were injured in the
demonstrations at Augsburg and in Berlin. About 30 Kurds were arrested.
At Wiesbaden, Kurdish demonstrators poured petrol on a train carriage and
set it alight, police said. Officers had earlier prevented the Kurds staging
a rally in Frankfurt, after which about 100 militants took the train to
Wiesbaden.
Nearly 50 of the officers were injured in the Augsburg disturbances, which
broke out on Saturday after police had stopped the Kurds who were travelling
in several buses outside the Bavarian city.
The demonstrators, supporters of the banned Kurdistan Worker's party (PKK),
responded by commandeering the buses and using them to block the motorway.
They also poured fuel on the asphalt and set it alight to block a motorway
exit. Other Kurds blocked intersections at Augsburg and threw firebombs, a
police spokesman said.
He said Kurds tried to douse two officers with petrol and set them on fire.
Another officer was knocked down and his gun was taken. Police used a water
cannon to clear the motorway after nine hours.
In Berlin, about 800 Kurds demonstrated on Saturday night against Turkish
policies. The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
homeland in south-eastern Turkey. Germany banned the PKK in November.
