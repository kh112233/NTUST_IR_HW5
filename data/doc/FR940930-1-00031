Lead; Requirements for Lead-Based Paint Activities; Notice of Hearing 



Agency:

 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 




Action:

 Informal Hearing.





<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On September 2, 1994, EPA published a proposed rule governing lead-based paint activities to ensure that individuals
engaged in such activities are properly trained; that training programs are accredited; and that contractors engaged
in such activities are certified. The proposed rule would also establish standards for performing lead-based paint
activities and require that all lead-based paint activities be performed by certified individuals. When promulgated,
the rule would fulfill the mandate of section 402(a)(1) of Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Additionally,
as part of the proposed rule, EPA has, in accordance with section 404(d) of TSCA, developed a proposed Model State Program.
When promulgated, this program may be adopted by any State that seeks to administer and enforce a State program under
Title IV of TSCA. In that notice, the Agency stated that it would hold an informal hearing. EPA will hold a 1day
public hearing.
