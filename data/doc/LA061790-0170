A 3-year-old boy who was shot in the head while playing with other children 
died after being airlifted to a Modesto hospital, Mariposa County Sheriff's 
Cmdr. 
Pelk Richards said. The boy, whose name was being withheld, was playing at his 
home when he was shot with a .22-caliber handgun, Richards said. Authorities 
are terming the shooting accidental, but investigators had not determined 
whether the wound was self-inflicted or if one of the other children fired the 
gun, he said.
