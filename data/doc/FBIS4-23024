  [Abstract] The mechanism of clinical enterobacteria strain 
resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics due to the antibiotics 
modification by three types of enzymes is discussed, and it is 
stressed that despite the great diversity of enterobacteria's 
aminoglycoresistance genes, three-to-four different types of 
encoding enzymes are predominant among clinical isolates. 
Consequently, an attempt is made to determine the types of 
enzymes produced by Serratia marcescens strains which 
inactivate aminoglycoside antibiotics and to identify the genes 
which encode them. To this end, 31 aminoglycoside antibiotic 
resistant strains of Serratia marcescens isolated by 
mid-1908s are used. The experimental procedure and the 
components used are outlined in detail. The study of the 
clinical isolates' sensitivity to a number of aminoglycoside 
antibiotics did not reveal strains which are highly resistant to 
amikacin yet the microorganisms' levels of sensitivity to this 
antibiotic varied within 0.5-8 g/ml. The diameters of the 
micro-organism growth suppression zones and types of 
aminoglycoside activating enzymes determined by two methods are 
summarized, and the conclusion is drawn that DNA-DNA 
hybridization is a reliable method of determining the presence 
of the specific resistance genes which makes it possible to 
identify silent genes which cannot be detected by the AGRP 
method; the latter, however, is suitable for reliably 
determining the types of aminoglycoside activating enzymes 
provided that the strains do not contain genes which code the 
enzymes with overlapping resistance spectra. Thus, 85% of 
the 
strains under study contain other genes encoding aminoglycoside 
activating enzymes in addition to the gene encoding the 
AAC(6')-Ic aminoglycosideacetyltransferase; this makes these 
strains resistant to a broad range of aminoglycoside 
antibiotics. Tables 1; references 5: 2 Russian, 3 Western.
