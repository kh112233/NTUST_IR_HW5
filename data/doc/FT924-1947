FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Patent hearing confirmed
A EUROPEAN Patent Office hearing yesterday confirmed the first patent for a
herbicide resistant plant, in a test case with important implications for
agrochemical, biotechnology and seeds companies.
The EPO granted the patent to Plant Genetics Systems of Belgium and Biogen
of the US for plants that are genetically engineered to resist Basta, a
broad-spectrum weedkiller made by Hoechst, the German chemical group.
The Munich hearing rejected claims by Greenpeace, the environmental group,
that the patent was immoral 'because the invention would lead to increased
pesticide use and the production of genetically engineered organisms which
pose an excessive risk to the environment.' The European Patent Convention
does not allow 'immoral' products or processes to be patented.
The two biotechnology companies plan to commercialise the invention in
collaboration with Hoechst and several seeds companies.
