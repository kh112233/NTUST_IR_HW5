RIGHT-TO-DIE CONTROVERSY 
I believe that Bill Bolte, a middle-aged disabled person, is dreaming about 
dragons that do not exist in his fear that anybody will ever seek the 
elimination of disabled persons who do not want to die. The entire point of 
right-to-die advocates is individual freedom of choice. 
We have no desire to advise others. 
We do not believe that Dr. Kevorkian should be tried for developing his suicide 
machine and allowing Janet Adkins to use it. (A judge threw out the murder 
charge against Kevorkian on Dec. 13). Mrs. Adkins had made her own free 
decision, and we see no reason why anybody should question her decision, right 
or wrong. 
I am 86, and do not want to spend any time in a nursing home for any reason. If 
my disability gets to the point where I have to go to a hospital, all I want is 
pain-killer drugs and a quick death. I bitterly resent all opposition to that 
desire. To others, I only say, mind your own business and I will never try to 
advise you on anything.
