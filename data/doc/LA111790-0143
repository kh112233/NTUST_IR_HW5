ESCAPEE SLAIN IN CHILE 
Police on Friday shot dead a left-wing guerrilla who escaped prison two days 
earlier, authorities said. 
Police said Marco Antonioletti, a member of the Marxist Movimiento Juvenil 
Lautaro, was killed in a gun battle early Friday when police found his hideout. 
Antonioletti was jailed a year ago, charged with killing a policeman.
