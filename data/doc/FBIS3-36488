  [Text] Russia has a perfect right not to allow the 
unauthorized entry into its territorial waters by Japanese 
ships. Border violations are intolerable, whoever commits them, 
Aleksandr Panov, Russian deputy foreign minister, told Interfax. 
  He admitted the existence of a territorial dispute between 
the two countries and emphasized that Russia did not refuse to 
discuss it. "If one party says a problem exists, the other 
cannot say it does not," Panov observed. 
  In his words, the territorial issue will be one of the items 
on the agenda of the Russo-Japanese working consultations to be 
held in Moscow on February 21 and 22 under the joint 
chairmanship of Hiroshi Fukuda, Panov's counterpart, and himself. 
  The deputy minister also said that the Russian negotiators 
would raise the issue of Japanese ships crossing illegally into 
Russian waters. "We will insist that the Japanese authorities 
take the necessary steps to prevent this," Panov said. 
  The meeting will discuss "a wide range of issues" around the 
wording and signing of a peace treaty. "We do not expect any 
dramatic or sensational decisions or recommendations. It will 
be a usual working meeting," the diplomat said.
