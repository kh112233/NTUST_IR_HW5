FT  06 MAR 92 / African states propose ivory trade deal
THE southern African governments pushing for a relaxation of the world ivory
trade ban announced yesterday they would drop demands for export permission
now if granted more control over their elephant herds, writes Robert Thomsom
in Tokyo.
Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and Malawi made this proposal to the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in Kyoto as it became
clear most of the 114 member states opposed lifting the ivory ban. Ivory is
one of the most emotive issues at the conference, which will also toughen or
relax protection of a wide range of other flora and fauna, and attempt to
set clearer standards for assessing if a species is endangered.
Instead of a total ban on ivory trade, the four governments want a
'voluntary moratorium' for a 'reasonable period.' They asked for 'time to
put in place a trading system that would not encourage illegal opportunities
for ivory trading' but made clear they expected limited trade to be
legalised in the longer term. Dr Simon Lyster of World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) said the four countries were moving 'in the right direction.'
