SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17689), FDA published a final rule that amended the standard of identity for evaporated milk
(21 CFR 131.130) to: (1) Reduce the minimum milkfat content requirement from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent by weight;
(2) reduce the minimum total milk solids content requirement from 25 percent to 23 percent by weight; and (3) add a minimum
milk solids-not-fat content requirement of 16.5 percent by weight. This action was based on a petition from the American
Dairy Products Institute, 130 North Franklin St., Chicago, IL 60606.


FDA gave interested persons until May 16, 1994, to file objections or requests for a hearing. The agency received no
objections or requests for a hearing on the final rule. Therefore, FDA finds that the final rule published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 14, 1994, should be confirmed.
