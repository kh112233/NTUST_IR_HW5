  [Text] According to data of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs of Tajikistan, during the past 5 years the volume of 
narcotics seized in the republic increased 46-fold, and the 
number of registered crimes connected with drug addiction 
doubled. There was a 49-fold increase in the area sown to opium 
poppy and hemp. There are whole settlements that live by virtue 
of this trade. For example, last year in Pendzhikentskiy Rayon 
of Leninabad Oblast alone, six metric tons of raw material was 
gathered, which is much more than in the preceding years. 
However, significantly fewer criminal proceedings were 
instituted apropos of this. 
  The leading place in this distribution is occupied by Gornyy 
Badakhshan, where the problem of drug addicts has acquired 
economic and political significance. In the recent past this 
area, which politically remains in Tajikistan, has been trying 
to keep the center out of its affairs. The difficult financial 
situation of the republic and the physical absence of money have 
made narcotics its peculiar equivalent, on the basis of which 
businessmen acquire goods in neighboring Uzbekistan and 
Kyrgyzia. In its turn, payment for the poison going to 
Afghanistan is effected through foodstuffs, fuel, and industrial 
consumer goods. 
  They export it by different paths, the chief one of which is 
the Pamir route, which operates the year around, to the Kyrgyz 
city of Osh. From here the narcotics are being distributed to 
the CIS countries and beyond, to the West. The transportation is 
going so successfully that in the Fayzabad District on the 
Afghan side a whole plant was built for the production of 
heroin, part of which was already discovered on our border. The 
saddest thing is the fact that not only local inhabitants have 
joined in this process, who are pushed into this by need, fear, 
or the presence of relatives in controlling drug business 
groupings. Since the beginning of this year, three employees of 
the collective peace-keeping forces were detained with 
narcotics. One of them is the navigator of a military aircraft. 
  Russian newspapers have repeatedly written about the fact 
that the drug business in the Pamir Mountains is controlled by 
some criminal groupings. The latest news from this oblast is a 
large-scale sorting out, as the result of which the leader of 
one of them by the name of Khafiz was killed. 
  According to one of the versions, he did not take part in 
the 
civil war--he was serving a sentence in places not so far away. 
Having returned home last year, he discovered the participation 
of Afghan mujaheddin in Pamir affairs, he came out against this, 
and he was killed. According to another version, not very 
different from this, he tried to unite groupings into a single 
whole and he did not find cooperation. 
  The struggle against the drug business complicated by many 
circumstances. For example, by the fact that, in the absence of 
proper legislation in regard to this question, the law 
enforcement organs up to now have been forced to be guided by 
the legislative acts of the Union that has long since ceased to 
exist--laws on the basis of which consumers of narcotics are 
relieved of responsibility. This is why whole links of the 
transportation and the storage of narcotics raw material are 
slipping out from under the control of the militia.
