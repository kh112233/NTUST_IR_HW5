  [Text] Taiwan's importers of corn and soybeans, 
retaliating against the U.S. ban on import of wildlife products, 
threatened Friday [13 May] to take their business worth about $1 
billion a year away from the United States. The Taiwan Feed 
Industry Association and the Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers 
Association lodged protests with Washington's unofficial embassy 
in Taipei over the U.S. ban on wildlife product imports from 
Taiwan. 
  President Bill Clinton announced the ban, worth up to $25 
million a year, last month in response to the island's continued 
trade in products made from endangered tigers and rhinos. 
  A spokesman for the Taiwan Feed Industry Association said if 
there is no goodwill response from the United States, his 
association will give priority to South Africa, Thailand, 
Central American countries, and Australia when buying corn and 
soybeans. The two associations of Taiwan's many importers of 
corn and soybeans buy 5 million and 2 million tons a year. ROC 
[Republic of China] officials have denounced the U.S. move as 
unjust after Mainland China eluded sanctions.
