  [Text] Colleagues and friends of jailed Ming Pao reporter 
Xi Yang are continuing to put pressure on the Chinese Government 
to release him. Yesterday, eight Ming Pao reporters tied yellow 
ribbons outside the official Xinhua news agency and handed in a 
letter demanding his release. 
  Mr Xi's father, Xi Ling-sheng, has visited his son twice. 
He said he was receiving "compulsory political education" but 
was painting and doing computer studies in his spare time. He 
was sharing a cell with three others. 
  The United Democrats of Hong Kong also sent about 20 members 
to protest at Xinhua. "We will continue to fight for the 
release of Xi until he is back, and for (his) safety in the 
mainland," a spokesman said. 
  Over the weekend Mr Xi, who was charged with "stealing state 
secrets," was given an award for outstanding journalistic 
performance by the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong--which 
regretted he was not on hand to receive it.
