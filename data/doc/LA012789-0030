Three members of a polygamist clan were sentenced to prison terms of up to 15 
years for the slaying of a law officer during a 13-day standoff at their Utah 
farm last year. The penalties will be served after they complete federal prison 
terms for taking part in the bombing of a Mormon chapel. State District Judge 
Michael Murphy in Salt Lake City sentenced clan leader Addam Swapp and his 
brother-in-law, John Timothy Singer, to one to 15 years for manslaughter and 
Swapp's brother, Jonathan, to a year in jail for negligent homicide. The 
sentences were pronounced two days before the anniversary of the shoot-out in 
Marion, Utah, that left state Corrections Lt. Fred House dead and Addam Swapp 
seriously wounded.
