  [Text] Sofia, March 10 (BTA) -- In response to an inquiry 
made by the Bulgarian Embassy in Belgrade and the urgent demands 
for returning the crew, the cargo and the Khan Kubrat ship, the 
director of the Yugoslav River Shipping Company said that the 
cargo is being unloaded. According to the director, both the 
buyer and the seller are in Prahovo, their identity has not been 
revealed and they have presented regular documents, a spokesman 
for the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said. 
  The crew is safe. 
  This information has not been confirmed by official 
representatives of the Serbian Government which the Bulgarian 
Embassy approached. 
  In this connection the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Republic of Bulgaria summoned the charge d'affaires of the 
Embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Mr. Smilkovic and 
set forth once again Bulgaria's demand for clarifying all 
circumstances around the incident and for the immediate return 
of the crew, the ship and its cargo to Bulgaria, the spokesman 
of the Foreign Ministry said. 
  The hijacked Bulgarian ship Khan Kubrat is in the Serbian 
village of Prahovo. The tugboat is at the port itself and the 
six barges loaded with fuel are 2 km away, customs officials 
told the BTA correspondent in Vidin this morning. The 
information was received late last night from SANCOM [UN 
Sanctions Committee] representatives who are near the Romanian 
town of Turnu Severin. According to the same source, on the 
morning of March 9 the Bulgarian tugboat left the area of the 
port, which prompted the report that the Khan Kubrat had left 
Prahovo. But the tugboat only made a manoeuvre and took one of 
the barges loaded with fuel to the terminal. The tugboat and 
one of the barges are in position, the BTA correspondent 
reported, citing information provided by SANCOM officers.
