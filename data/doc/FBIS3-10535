"ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Flores] At noon, Juan Francisco Franco Rios, 
attorney general for Baja California State, announced a total 
reorganization of the Baja California Judicial Police. This is 
what he said: 
  [Begin Rios recording] In 15 days, we will totally 
reorganize 
the state's Judicial Police. When I say totally, I mean the 
absolute and complete reorganization relating to the actions and 
conduct of Judicial Police members. [end recording] 
  At a news conference, the state attorney general said that 
bad policemen will be dismissed immediately, especially those 
who took part in Thursday's shoot-out, here in Tijuana, where 
Federal Judicial Police Commander Salvador Miramontes Torres 
died, federal policeman Juan Jesus Hernandez Tejeda was 
seriously wounded, and a state policeman was also killed. 
  Franco Rios reiterated that the investigation continues so 
as 
to supply the judge handling the case with the most evidence so 
he can best ascertain the responsibility of the policemen 
involved as well as the involvement of Tijuana Assistant 
Attorney General Sergio Ortiz Lara and the group leaders named 
by the Attorney General's Office. 
  The attorney general said that many of these policemen went 
to the scene of the shoot-out to do their duty but their names 
are listed in the case. He also said that on Monday two agents 
from Attorney General's Office in Ensenada and Mexicali arrived 
here in Tijuana to continue the case and to clarify which agents 
are involved in drug trafficking. Finally, Deputy Alejandro 
Monraz called for the creation of a special Prosecutor's Office, 
with no connection with the state Attorney General's Office, to 
investigate Thursday night's shoot-out in La Mesa area, where 
four people were killed and eight, wounded. 
  [Announcer] I asked you if this is in response to the 
Thursday shoot-out? 
  [Flores] Yes, of course. The Attorney General's Office held 
a 
news conference on Sunday here in Tijuana. It was learned that 
there is a direct connection between the shoot-out and State 
Judicial Police. Many of them are at the state Attorney 
General's Office right now. No arrests warrants have been issued 
yet, even though many were detained. At least three group 
leaders are accused of being involved in the shoot-out, 
especially as bodyguards of a lieutenant working for the 
Arellano Felix brothers. They said they sold protection to the 
lieutenant.
