  [Excerpts] Bonn/Hamburg (DPA)--For the first time in its 
history, the Federal Republic of Germany will have to face the 
Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. The Foreign 
Ministry confirmed reports today by the Hamburg news magazine 
DER SPIEGEL and by Sueddeutscher Rundfunk that three complaints 
against Germany had been lodged with the Human Rights 
Commission. [passage omitted] 
  The Foreign Ministry expressly denied that Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel would attend the meeting of the Commission in 
Geneva in connection with the complaints. 
  SPIEGEL reports that the Commission's 53 member states will 
deal with "complaints about xenophobic activity in Germany" at 
their meeting in Geneva on 31 January. The Foreign Ministry 
remarked that it was "highly unusual" that a Western state was 
facing charges of this kind. 
  Sueddeutscher Rundfunk also reported that a confidential 
examination was being carried out into allegations of xenophobia 
by a group of teachers from Thuringia who had not been admitted 
to the civil service. There was also a complaint by prisoners 
who said they were not receiving enough pay for their work in 
prison.
