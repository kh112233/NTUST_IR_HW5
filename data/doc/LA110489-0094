CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
WATSONVILLE; 
JAPANESE STUDENTS AID QUAKE VICTIMS 
Led by a World War II Japanese fighter pilot, 34 students arriving fresh from 
Tokyo to help California earthquake victims raised their fists and cheered 
three times, "We will do our best!" Then they pitched in at a Salvation Army 
relief center Thursday, packing food boxes, sorting clothing and putting 
together sacks of baby supplies. The students flew to California at their own 
expense to help 3,000 victims displaced in the Watsonville area by the Oct. 17 
earthquake.
