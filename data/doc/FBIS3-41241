  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Plantations in Peru 
  It has been reported that Colombian and Mexican mafia 
members 
had entered Peru by July 1993 and distributed poppy seeds among 
the coca growers of the Amazon, San Martin, and Huanuco regions, 
among others. Some growers already have sown the seeds but 
others still have not decided whether they will do it. 
  Nonetheless, poppy already had been planted in Cajamarca and 
the Amazon region before these mafia members visited them. Poppy 
plantations can be found in San Ignacio, Jaen, and Bambamarca in 
Cajamarca; as well as in Condorcanqui and Bagua in the Amazon 
region. In Piura Department, some plantations were detected in 
the Huancabamba area. 
  Maritza Rojas, chief of the Cedro [Information and Education 
Center to Prevent Drug Abuse] investigation area, pointed out 
that members of several Cedro programs being implemented in the 
jungle have been in San Martin in the last few months and were 
told about poppy being planted in the region. 
  Rojas added that at Naranjillo, Nueva Cajamarca, Roque, 
Soritor, Tabalosos, Tingo del Ponasa, and the Sauce area--in the 
Mayo, Sisa, and Biabo valleys--there are also poppy plantations. 
  She concluded by stating the other plantations were detected 
at Sarapampa in the Ayacucho jungle.
