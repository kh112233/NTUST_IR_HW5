  [Text] Vilnius, Mar 14, BNS -- The Lithuanian Government 
approved two furthermost points of land in the sea which are 
necessary to determine the border of the country's territorial 
waters. 
  According to a March 10 government resolution, the northern 
"side-point" is on the territory of the Palanga resort, while 
the southern point is located on the Kursiu peninsula on the 
border with the Kaliningrad region. 
  According to the Lithuanian law, the country's territorial 
waters extend 12 nautical miles off the coast. According to the 
international conventions that Lithuania signed, the sea border 
must run more or less parallel to the coastline without any 
major deviations. 
  Zenonas Kumetaitis, director of the Lithuanian Geodesy 
Service, said the absence of a clear territorial sea border was 
a major hindrance in talks with Latvia and Russia on sea border. 
In his words, Lithuania will now be able to determine 
"side-borders" with its neighbors.
