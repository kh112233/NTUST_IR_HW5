  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 07, BNS -- The tourism sector was in 
1993 the second-biggest foreign exchange earner in Estonia, Bank 
of Estonia spokesman Jaanus Kroon said today at a briefing at 
the Estonian Tourist Board. 
  Tourism was preceded by transport and followed by 
construction, Kroon added. 
  Estonia last year exported tourism services worth nearly 659 
million kroons. Import of tourism services over the same period 
amounted to almost 336 million kroons. 
  Travel agents and tour operators accounted for 59 percent of 
the exports and 25 percent of the imports. Apparently most 
Estonians travel abroad without availing themselves of the 
services of tourism companies, Kroon said. 
  Finns accounted for 80 percent of the tourists visiting 
Estonia; 40 percent of them were so-called "shopping tourists." 
  Obviously, tourism is one of the country's principal sources 
of revenue and the state should give serious attention to 
promoting the sector. The Bank of Estonia fully subscribes to 
this opinion of the Estonian Association of Travel Agents, Kroon 
stated.
