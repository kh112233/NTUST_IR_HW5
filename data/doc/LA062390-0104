BRIEFLY 
Pact Reached on VDT Safety at Fresno Bee: The Fresno Bee has reached an 
agreement with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health on a 
long-term safety plan to protect workers using computer terminals. 
The plan will require a $750,000 investment. The Newspaper Guild filed a 
complaint last year after numerous Bee editorial staffers suffered wrist, arm 
and shoulder injuries resulting from their work at video display terminals. The 
Guild said as many as one-third of the editorial staff experienced problems.
