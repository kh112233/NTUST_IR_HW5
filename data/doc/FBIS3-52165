  [Text] Foreign Minister Peres says unfortunately Israel 
will not be going back to the Taba talks tomorrow. Reporter Amy 
Rhodes asked Peres for his reaction to the Jordanian press 
report that King Husayn had threatened to make a separate peace 
with Israel unless Yasir 'Arafat cooperated with him more 
closely. 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] I am for having a comprehensive 
peace with all parties, but I am for arriving at the 
comprehensive peace on an individual basis, because if we shall 
try to have comprehensive negotiations, so the ones who are 
usually late, or reluctant, or hesitant will hold back the 
negotiations. 
  [Rhodes] Will the Taba talks resume tomorrow? 
  [Peres] I am afraid not. 
  [Rhodes] What is the reason that it will be delayed? 
  [Peres] The talks in Taba need a common basis, need an 
understanding. The two faxes that we have received on Friday 
created a sort of a doubt about what is the basis for the talks 
in Taba. 
  [Rhodes] How do you plan on going about reaching another 
agreement such as the one that was reached in Cairo but not 
accepted by the Palestinians? 
  [Peres] To be true to the agreements that we have reached in 
Oslo and in Cairo and to reject anything that tries to annul it.
