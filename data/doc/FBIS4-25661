  [Text] Beijing, June 14 (AFP) -- China reaffirmed its 
sovereignty claim over the Spratly Islands on Tuesday and 
attacked oil exploration in the area by other countries. "China 
has irrefutable sovereignety over the Nansha Islands (Spratlys) 
and its adjacent waters," a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP. 
"Any country's exploration and exploitation activities of oil 
and gas there should not damage" China's interests, he added. 
  The comment came in reply to a question on the Philippines 
allowing Alcorn Petroleum and Minerals Corp. and U.S. partner 
Vaalco Energy Inc. to begin preliminary exploration work near 
the disputed South China Sea chain. Philippine energy officials 
insisted Tuesday the area where the exploration would be 
conducted is not part of the Spratlys -- a chain of atolls in 
the South China Sea claimed wholly by China and in part by 
Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
  The Spratlys are believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil 
and natural gas and also straddle strategic sea lanes. Two 
other U.S. firms, Crestone Energy Corp. and Mobil are already 
exploring part of the area on behalf of the Chinese and 
Vietnamese governments respectively. Both governments 
vehemently criticised each other's moves.
