SCIENCE; 
SWEDES CLAIM COLD-FUSION SUCCESS 
Swedish physicists said today that they produced a burst of neutron radiation 
in a room-temperature experiment, repeating the work of two chemists who 
claimed to have achieved cold fusion in a jar. 
The scientists at Manne Siegbahn Institute for Physics said their method was 
similar to the experiment that chemists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann 
said they conducted at the University of Utah. 
In March, the two claimed to have produced sustained fusion in a jar at much 
colder temperatures than previously thought possible. Repeated attempts by 
other scientists to duplicate the Fleischmann-Pons experiments have had mixed 
results.
