FT  27 JUL 94 / New blow struck in 'tuna war'
More than 300 Spanish trawlers yesterday sealed off entry to the main
domestic northern ports and also to the harbour of the French border town of
Hendaye in protest against EU regulations over the use of drift nets. The
blockade, which affected both the important industrial port of Bilbao and
the port of Santander, a main entry point for tourist-laden ferries from
Britain and France, marked an escalation in a running 'tuna war' between
Spanish and French fishermen. Last week the Spanish trawler fleet boarded a
French vessel at sea and towed it back to its home port where the local
authorities established that it had been using 5km-long drift nets, twice
the length permitted by EU regulations. In retaliation, the French navy
impounded a Spanish trawler which was subsequently fined for taking
undersize fish. Spain's trawler fleet said it would continue its protest
until the EU took firm action against the use of oversize nets.
