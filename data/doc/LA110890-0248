RECALLS; 
NISSAN VAN HOSES FOUND FAULTY 
Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. today announced the recall of about 33,000 1987-90 
model Nissan Vans to replace power-steering hoses that could leak and cause an 
engine- compartment fire. 
The auto maker said it is aware of only one minor injury resulting from the 
problem. 
Nissan will make all repairs free of charge at authorized dealers after owners 
are notified by mail. 
Nissan discontinued sales of its Van model this year. The Nissan Axxess van is 
not affected by the recall.
