<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces the availability of a draft supplemental environmental impact statement
(SEIS) for the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DOE/EIS0082SD) at the Savannah River Site,
Aiken, South Carolina. The document supplements an EIS that DOE issued in 1982 (DOE/EIS0082) to construct
and operate the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). The draft SEIS assesses the potential environmental impacts
of completing and operating the DWPF, as modified since 1982, to immobilize high-level radioactive waste at the Savannah
River Site by incorporating the waste into borosilicate glass by a process called vitrification. The draft SEIS also
addresses the potential impacts of no action and of alternative pretreatment processes for the waste. DOE invites
public comments on the draft SEIS, and will hold public hearings on the document.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

The public comment period extends through October 11, 1994. Written comments regarding the document should be postmarked
by that date to ensure consideration in preparation of the final SEIS. Comments postmarked after that date will be
considered to the extent practicable. Comments may also be submitted orally or in writing at the following public
hearings (which will also serve as information meetings): September 13, 1994, in Aiken, South Carolina; September
15, 1994, in Beaufort and Hardeeville, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia; and September 20, 1994, in Allendale,
