  [Text] Moscow April 8 TASS -- Russian nationalist leader 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on Friday created another scandal in the 
Russian State Duma. During a coffee-break he beat up lawmaker 
Vladimir Borzyuk who, earlier this week, had quit Zhirinovskiy's 
faction in protest against his extremist policies. 
  Alla Gerber of Russia's Choice told TASS she saw 
"Zhirinovskiy striking Borzyuk's head against the wall." Then, 
according to the eyewitness, Vladimir Volfovich turned his anger 
against a passing journalist, seized his tape-recorder and broke 
the journalist's glasses. 
  The Russia's Choice faction proposed to set up a special 
commission to investigate the incident, but the Duma turned the 
proposal down, saying the case was within the competence of the 
Duma's procedural committee. 
  Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin told reporters he would file 
public 
prosecutor a report on the incident by Zhirinovskiy's victim, 
journalist Andrey Pyatkovskiy of the "STOLITSA" magazine.
