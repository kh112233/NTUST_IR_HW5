<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft Environmental
Assessment addressing genetic management options for the Florida panther, 

Felis concolor coryi. 

A single population estimated to number 30 to 50 adults represents the sole known remaining population in the wild.
This population utilizes approximately 23 million acres of habitat on public and privately owned lands in
south Florida. Existing data indicate that the Florida panther will likely to extinct without actions to restore
genetic health to the population. The Environmental Assessment examines four genetic management alternatives
for the panther. The preferred alternative involves a strategy to restore lost gene flow to the panther from a western


Felis concolor 

population. Copies of the draft Environmental Assessment can be obtained by making requests to the address below.
This notice is being furnished under provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR 1501.7)
to obtain comments from other agencies and the public on the draft Environmental Assessment. Following an appropriate
public comment and review process, the Service intends to evaluate all comments received and select an intended course
of action by December 31, 1994.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments on the draft Environmental Assessment must be received on or before December 5, 1994 to receive consideration
by the Service.

Background



Restoring endangered or threatened animals or plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goals of the Service's endangered species program. The Service will consider all
information presented during the public comment period prior to finalizing and implementing a specific genetic
management strategy for the Florida panther.

The Florida panther is one of the most endangered large mammals in the world. The biological circumstances of geographic
isolation, habitat loss, population reductions, and associated inbreeding have resulted in significant loss of
genetic variability and health of the population. The genetic variability and health of the Florida population must
be restored for the tax on to survive even with adequate habitat preservation and other enhancement measures.

The Florida panther formerly occupied a range comprising much of the southeastern United States. This range was contiguous
with other populations of North American cougars (

Felis concolor 

spp.). The panther is presently restricted to a small relict population in southern Florida numbering 30 to 50 adults.
This population utilizes approximately 23 million acres of habitat on public and privately owned lands.

Population declines and associated inbreeding in the Florida panther have resulted in significant losses in genetic
variability and viability. The population exhibits multiple physiological abnormalities that are likely a consequence
of recent close inbreeding. High incidences of maladaptive traits which include reproductive and medical abnormalities
have been observed. Significant among these are: Cryptorchidism (50+% of male population at times), abnormal sperm
(average 93.5% per ejaculate), and atrial septal defects (5 individuals). Furthermore, the Florida panther has
suffered from numerous health problems and infectious diseases that many be a consequence of a defective immune system.

The goal will be to develop and implement a management strategy to restore and maintain the historic genetic character
of the of Florida panther. The objectives will be to reduce the occurrence of inbreeding and restore genetic variability
and vitality of offspring produced and recruited as breeders into a healthier, ore resilient panther population
and to resume the evolutionary adaptive potential by restoring levels of genetic diversity in the Florida population
to levels comparable of other 

Felis concolor 

subspecies in western North America. The identification and implementation of actions needed to accomplish this
goal will be guided by the analysis and evaluation of various alternatives that may be available.
