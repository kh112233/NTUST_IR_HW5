<F P=106> [Article by Tomi Saluveer: "Privatizers To Sell Shares Of </F>
Companies"] 
  [Text] 
  The Privatization Agency, in cooperation with different 
ministries, will start compiling a list of companies to be 
privatized through public sale of shares, said Vaino 
Sarnet, 
executive director of the Privatization Agency. 
  The listing is being compiled now, and a preliminary copy of 
it should be ready before the end of the year. "The list is made 
up of roughly 100 companies, spanning a wide range of economic 
sectors," Sarnet added. 
  The number of companies in the first listing depends on the 
preparation rate of privatization securities or shares of 
national capital, according to Riho Rasmann, a counsel at the 
Economic Ministry. 
  "Once the legislative basis reaches an adequate level next 
year, 100 to 150 companies could be listed," Rasmann said. 
<H5>  Advantages of Keeping the Company Intact </H5>
  Whenever a company is sold by means of shares, it is usually 
sold in its entirety, and structuring of the company as a whole 
will be up to the new owners, Rasmann said. The sale of 
companies in their divided form has caused a lot of confusion 
that has played havoc with planning the operations of the 
company. 
  "The selection should not include companies with known 
social 
or political problems," Rasmann said. Also excluded should be 
companies that are the sole employers in their particular 
regions." He added that companies on the verge of bankruptcy 
should also be left out. 
  Rasmann said that the list could also be compiled by making 
random choices. "According to the probability theory, the 
resulting listing would be made up of poor, good as well as 
average companies," he said. "People, however, will have more of 
a choice for making an investment." 
  Still unsettled, according to Sarnet, is the 'degree of 
freedom' applying to the sale of shares, which will determine if 
individuals can sell their national capital shares among their 
relatives only, or will they be given more leeway when it comes 
to selling. 
<H5>  Keeping Ordinary Citizens Informed </H5>
  Rasmann also suggested that more information should be made 
available to ordinary citizens, explaining how the national 
capital shares can be used, and letting them know that shares in 
privatized companies can be bought directly or through 
investment funds. 
  In principle, the public sale of shares will proceed 
according to the Privatization Law. For the time being, Sarnet 
said, the role of possible investment funds has not been spelled 
out yet. 
  According to Rasmann, the banking system, consulting firms 
and investment funds are all ready to participate in launching 
the system of securities. 
  "I know companies where people are trained specifically to 
do 
that, and will be ready to start, once the process is 
activated," Rasmann added. 
  He also said that in the Czech Republic, for example, 
investment funds are by now doing a brisk business buying and 
trading shares of different companies. The structure of owners 
changes constantly, as everyone tries to buy shares in companies 
they trust most. 
<H5>  State Will Not Make a Good Seller </H5>
  "Generally speaking, selling company shares is profitable to 
both the state and the company, but it also plays a very 
important role in speeding up the prizatization process, and 
making it more efficient," Rasmann said. "The state, by itself, 
however, will not make the best of sellers." 
  Sarnet said that although several issues about the public 
sale of shares are still being debated, all participants agree 
that the sale of shares should be launched without delay. 
"Disclosing the listing is an important element in triggering 
the process," he said. 
  In accordance with the privatization program, the 
Privatization Agency must complete the listing of companies to 
be sold through public sale of shares by January of next year.
