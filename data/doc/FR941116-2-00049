submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension
of a patent which claims that human drug product.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.


A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Zerit

&reg;

 (stavudine). Zerit

&reg;

 is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are intolerant
of approved therapies with proven clinical benefit or who have experienced significant clinical or immunologic
deterioration while receiving these therapies or for whom such therapies are contraindicated. Subsequent to this
approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for Zerit

&reg;

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,978,655) from Yale University, and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance
in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated September 28, 1994, FDA advised
the Patent Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period and that the approval
of Zerit

&reg;

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period. 
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Zerit

&reg;

 is 1,984 days. Of this time, 1,805 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 179
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: January 19, 1989. The applicant claims March 1, 1989, as the date investigational new drug application (IND) for
Zerit

&reg;

 (IND 32,486) became effective. However, FDA records indicated that IND 32,486 was received by the agency on December
16, 1988. It was placed on clinical hold on January 3, 1989, and was removed from hold on January 19, 1989. Therefore,
the IND effective date was January 19, 1989.
2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act

: December 28, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that the new drug application (NDA) for Zerit

&reg;

 (NDA 20412) was initially submitted on December 28, 1993. 
3. 

The date the application was approved

: June 24, 1994. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20412 was approved on June 24, 1993.
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 188 days of patent term
extension. 


Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before January 17, 1995, submit to the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before May 15, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 4142, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.
