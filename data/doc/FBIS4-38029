  [Text] An official Yemeni spokesman has denied rumors 
circulated by certain Gulf and foreign media that the forces of 
legitimacy violated the cease-fire. 
  In a press statement issued last night, the Yemeni spokesman 
refuted allegations by REUTER and other Gulf news agencies that 
the aircraft of the legitimate forces raided Aden suburbs where 
the rebels are deployed and targeted the drinking water storage 
tanks in the area. The spokesman said these allegations are 
fabricated, noting that the drinking water sources are 
controlled by the forces of legitimacy and not in the hands of 
the rebels. 
  The source criticized reports by the Egyptian Middle East 
News Agency, the United Arab Emirates Television, and the Kuwait 
Television that the forces of legitimacy violated the 
cease-fire. He stressed that this bias in favor of the western 
media organs serve schemes that aim only at harming Yemen and 
the unity of its people and land.
