THE STATE; 
GAY COUPLES POLICY BACKED 
San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos said he will support a newly introduced domestic 
partners proposal that would provide gay and lesbian couples with some of the 
benefits that married couples receive. "I look forward to signing" the 
proposal, Agnos said during a press conference called by Supervisor Harry Britt 
to introduce the measure. Among other things, the proposal would require the 
city to provide partners of gay and lesbian city employees with the same health 
insurance and other benefits that opposite-sex spouses receive. Britt said he 
was assured of support from the majority of supervisors and expects a vote on 
the measure in May. In 1982, Britt proposed similar measure that was passed by 
the board of supervisors, but was vetoed by then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein.
