  [Text] Cairo, 3 Apr (MENA)--Ibrahim al-Baradi'i, an AKHBAR 
AL- YAWM correspondent in Qalyub, was killed today after having 
been hit by a stray bullet. A responsible security source said 
that the reporter was sitting with three friends in a cafe in 
Qalyub, 20 km north of Cairo. As the four people left the cafe 
the reporter felt a pain in his neck and was bleeding. He was 
taken to Qalyub General Hospital where he died. A bullet was 
found lodged in his neck. The security source said that the 
victim's three friends affirmed that they did not hear any sound 
of gunfire, so it is likely that the stray bullet was fired from 
a long distance. The security agencies are continuing their 
investigations to determine the details of the incident.
