<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening to November 16, 1994, the comment period for a proposed rule that
appeared in the 

Federal Register

 of July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36379). The document proposed to revise the guidelines for voluntary nutrition labeling of
raw fruit, vegetables, and fish; revise the definition for compliance with respect to adherence by retailers to those
guidelines; and revise the labeling regulations and labeling values for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruit,
vegetables, and fish. This action is in response to the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. In addition,
the document solicited comments on all aspects of the FDA data base review process. FDA is taking this action in response
to several requests for an extension of the comment period.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of July 18, 1994 (59 FR 36379), FDA issued a proposed rule to adopt regulations to revise the guidelines for voluntary
labeling of raw fruit, vegetables, and fish. The agency also published a correction document on July 21, 1994 (59 FR
37190), to correct an inadvertent error in the proposal. Interested persons were given until September 16, 1994,
to comment on the proposal. 


FDA has received several requests from trade associations for an extension of the comment period in order to better
review the proposal and prepare comments. Most requests ask for a 30-day extension. 
After careful review of these requests, FDA has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow additional time
for comments. With the additional period, the agency is providing more than 90 days for comments. FDA considers that
this amount of time should be more than ample for interested persons to complete and submit their comments. Accordingly,
the agency is reopening the comment period to November 16, 1994. 
Interested persons may, on or before November 16, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this proposal. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
