  [Text] Washington, June 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today pledged U.S. support for the Middle East peace 
process to Jordan's King Husayn. 
  "I want to reaffirm the support of the United States for a 
comprehensive settlement in the Middle East," Clinton told 
reporters at the White House before meeting with Husayn. 
  Clinton expressed his welcome to King Husayn back to the 
White House [as received] and said that "I support his courage 
and vision in renewing his efforts to make peace with Israel." 
  "This remains a very important priority for me and for our 
administration, and I am very encouraged by where we are now in 
the whole process, and especially by efforts that King Husayn 
has made," the President said. 
  It was reported that King Husayn was ready to take major 
steps toward normal relations with Israel and would not wait for 
similar progress in Israel's dealings with other Arab countries. 
  Asked if he is seeking a separate peace with Israel, Husayn 
said that "I'm seeing the beginning of serious negotiation on 
the agenda that was ratified here in Washington as rapidly as 
possible" [as received]. 
  "This is what we expected to be engaged in in the coming 
period," Husayn said, "but beyond that, we certainly would share 
with the President our hope that we will have a comprehensive 
peace in the entire region."
