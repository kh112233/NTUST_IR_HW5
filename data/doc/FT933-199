FT  30 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: NEC backs quota system for
women
THE leadership yesterday appealed to the party to back plans to boost the
number of women MPs.
Ms Brenda Etchells of the national executive committee put proposals to
delegates for a system whereby all-woman shortlists for parliamentary
candidates should be drawn up in 50 per cent of all winnable seats, and 50
per cent of those that become vacant when a sitting MP retires.
