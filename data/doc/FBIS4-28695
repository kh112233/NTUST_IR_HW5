  [Text] Manila, June 13 (AFP) -- The Philippine Government 
has authorized an affiliate of the US firm Vaalco Energy Inc. to 
conduct preliminary oil drilling research in the disputed 
Spratly Islands, the Department of Energy said Monday. 
  The six-month permit allows Alcorn (Production) Philippines 
Inc. to conduct "research and library work" on aeromagnetic 
surveys and other data already held by the department, its oil 
and gas division chief, Ismael Ocampo, said. 
  The permit covers the Kalayaan group of eight islands and 
reefs currently garrisoned by Philippine troops. 
  Ocampo told AFP the permit, the first to be granted by 
Manila 
in the area, was "sensitive" due to conflicting territorial 
claims on the strategic South China Sea chain by Brunei, China, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
  Because of the territorial conflict, any eventual drilling 
to 
be permitted by Manila would have to be in a "joint venture with 
China and Vietnam," he said, adding that no other Philippine oil 
exploration firm has applied for permit in the Kalayaan area. 
  An Alcorn official, Ponciano Mathay, told AFP his company 
has 
applied for a permit to conduct research on the Kalayaan area, 
but insisted the energy department had yet to approve it. 
  He said the permit would not require Alcorn to conduct 
actual 
drilling. 
  Two US firms, Crestone Energy and Mobil, are exploring for 
oil in disputed areas in the South China Sea, with Crestone 
enjoying the protection of the Chinese navy. Mobil obtained its 
permit from Vietnam. 
  Alcorn is the operator of the West Linapacan offshore 
production site off the western island of Palawan, the only 
wells in commercial production in the Philippines. 
  Water intrusion has drastically reduced production to about 
3,500 barrels per day from 15,000 bpd last year, but the 
consortium plans to boost output to about 6,000 bpd following 
the drilling of a sidetrack well last month.
