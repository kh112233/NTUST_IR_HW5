FT  13 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Work on Alcan hydro project
remains stalled
ALCAN Aluminium will not resume construction on the CDollars 1bn Kemano
hydro-electric expansion project following last week's federal appeal court
decision. It said it would delay any further work until every possible court
challenge is exhausted, including a fresh environmental review of the
project proposed by the British Columbia government.
Alcan won an appeal in the federal court which overruled native and
environmental groups' claims that Kemano II should be submitted to a full
federal environmental review.
