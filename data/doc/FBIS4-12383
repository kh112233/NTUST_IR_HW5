  [Text] Amman (INA) -- The Jordanian Arab Socialist Ba'th 
Party- Higher Command has called on the Arab countries involved 
in the settlement with the Zionist entity to stop and 
immediately end the negotiations. 
  In a statement distributed in Amman yesterday, the party 
said 
that reality has proven that these negotiations constitute a 
danger to established Arab national rights. The party called 
for escalating the struggle by all ways and means in order to 
break the back of the aggressors who seek to dominate the Arab 
nation and plunder its resources. 
  The statement also explains that the continuation of the 
unjust blockade, which the United States and its allies have 
imposed on the Iraqi people for more than four years, is only 
aimed at subjugating great Iraq and its brave people to the 
policy of hegemony pursued by the U.S. Administration and its 
followers. 
  The statement refers to the piracy of U.S. fleets in 
inspecting, with various weak excuses and arguments, ships 
heading toward the Jordanian port of al-'Aqabah, whether they 
are at sea or in Arab territorial waters. 
  The statement notes that this situation has created a siege 
on Jordan and has done great harm and damage to its economy and 
to national and pan-Arab interests.
