FT  02 AUG 93 / Liberian ceasefire in force
A CEASEFIRE signed a week ago to end Liberia's civil war came into effect
successfully at midnight on Saturday, a West African military force officer
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Monrovia.
'All sides seem to be observing the ceasefire. I think everybody is fed up
with the fighting,' said Mr John Addah, deputy field commander of Ecomog,
the joint west African military force.
Mr Addah said some fighters of Mr Charles Taylor's rebel National Patriotic
Front for Liberia (NPFL) had tried to surrender at Ecomog lines in the
Buchanan area, south-east of Monrovia.
'We told them to go back to their positions until we set the process of
disarmament in motion. We want them to be able to benefit from the
rehabilitation programme,' he said.
In a speech to the nation interim President Amos Sawyer said: 'The guns of
war in the Liberian crisis are silent for ever.' The NPFL's radio station
urged fighters to return to their homes and rebuild their lives.
More than 150,000 people have been killed in three and a half years of
warfare, according to the United Nations.
