40 EVACUATED IN TRAIN ACCIDENT RETURN HOME 
About 40 people forced from their homes by a freight train wreck were allowed 
to return early Wednesday, ending the second evacuation in two days, 
authorities said. 
Two tanker cars containing flammable butane caught fire Sunday and forced the 
evacuation of 2,000 people. As the train was being moved Tuesday, another 
tanker jumped the tracks, forcing the second evacuation.
