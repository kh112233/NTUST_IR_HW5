WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST LOS ANGELES; 
BERLIN WALL DISPLAY 
A free exhibition of nine original graffiti-covered segments of the Berlin Wall 
will be on display June 15 to July 4 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Tennessee 
Avenue Space, 11560 Tennessee Ave., West Los Angeles. 
Much of the graffiti on the wall segments -- eight are 5-by-4 feet, the other 
is 13-by-4 feet -- is nonpolitical, except for English words like "freedom." 
The wall segments were acquired by West Berlin businessman Tobias Hausberg, who 
will be present during the exhibition. 
In addition to the wall segments, large-scale photographs of the wall by 
photographer Leland Rice, East Germany memorabilia and a videotape chronicling 
the history of the Berlin Wall since 1961 will also be on display. 
For more information call Raleigh Enterprises, which is sponsoring the 
exhibition along with Executive Life Insurance, at (213) 312-3600.
