FT  18 MAY 92 / International Company News: Astra ulcer therapy threatens
Glaxo sales
ASTRA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, believes it has developed a new
therapy for peptic ulcers that could seriously undermine sales of Zantac,
the world's best-selling drug, which generates annual revenues of Dollars
3bn for Glaxo of the UK.
The new treatment eradicates a bacterium, helicobacter pylori (HP), which
specialists believe is a significant cause of recurring peptic ulcers.
By eliminating HP, Astra believes it could reduce the need for long-term
preventative therapy. Glaxo estimates that 40 to 50 per cent of Zantac
prescriptions are for long-term maintenance therapy.
Astra has been testing a combination of its Losec ulcer drug with an
antibiotic on patients infected with HP. Two studies revealed last week at
the annual convention of the American Gastroenterological Association showed
that the drugs could eradicate HP in as many as 80 per cent of duodenal
ulcer patients. Of these patients, all remained ulcer-free for 12 months
after the treatment.
The effect of eradicating HP is not new, said Mr Robin Gilbert,
pharmaceuticals analyst at James Capel. However, previous treatments to
eliminate the bug required taking 18 pills a day on five separate occasions,
normally within a hospital environment. The importance of the new treatment
is that only one pill a day, prescribed by a general practitioner, would be
needed.
'If this combination fulfils its early promise it could revolutionise the
market,' said Mr Gilbert. 'The maintenance market could virtually
disappear.'
Astra claims the combination works because Losec reduces the acid content of
the stomach allowing the antibiotic to work more effectively. Antibiotics
able to withstand acid did not prove as effective because patients had built
up resistance to them.
