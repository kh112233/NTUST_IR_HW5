  [Text] Prague, June 20 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government will 
try to settle the property disputes with the Czech Republic 
before the parliamentary elections scheduled for September 
30-October 1, Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan told a meeting 
organized by the Bohemiae Foundation today. 
  The so far unresolved property "disputes" make up around two 
and a half per cent of the total bulk of the former federal 
(Czechoslovak) property; they largely pertain to the "Slovak 
gold," Slovak Ambassador to the Czech Republic Ivan Mjartan 
said. Slovakia has claimed several tonnes of gold amassed by 
the Nazi-sponsored Slovak state during World War Two which was 
confiscated by Czechoslovakia after the war. 
  The meeting of the two countries' premiers which occurred 
this weekend in the Crans-Montana economic forum has contributed 
to the prospective solution of the "feuds", Kukan noted. 
  As there were 70 years of common history, relations between 
the two states, however independent, still form a "special 
category," Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Vondra said. 
As far as the future development of the Czech-Slovak relations 
is concerned, consensus on the "strategic objectives" of the 
foreign policy is necessary, Vondra added. This afternoon Kukan 
will meet Premier Vaclav Klaus and President Vaclav Havel.
