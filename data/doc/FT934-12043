FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Camco and Smith Intl indicted
TWO US oil services com-panies - Camco International, owned by Pearson of
the UK, and Smith International - have been charged with price fixing over
the sale of drill bits in the US in 1989.
The two companies were formally indicted last week by a federal grand jury
in Houston, Texas.
In separate statements, both Camco and Smith said they had been charged with
a breach of the Sherman Antitrust Act over the sale of drill bits during
part of 1989. No individuals linked to either company had been named in the
action, they said.
Each company also said that it had settled a related civil class action last
month which had been brought by drill bit purchasers, and that they would
defend themselves 'vigorously' against the indictment.
Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, has indicated its intention to
spin off Camco as part of a move to focus on its media interests.
