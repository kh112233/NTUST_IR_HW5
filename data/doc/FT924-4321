FT  03 DEC 92 / Copiers under attack
US personal computer software companies have launched a world-wide effort to
counter software pirates operating electronic bulletin board systems which
they allege are illegally distributing copies of their programs, Louise
Kehoe writes from San Francisco.
Electronic bulletin boards consist of a computer that can be accessed by
other personal computers via telephone lines. PC users can dial these
services and obtain copies of programs or send messages. For the most part
this is a legitimate cottage industry run by computer enthusiasts. Some,
however, offer cheap copies of popular software programs.
Berlin police recently raided 13 bulletin board operations after an
investigation by the Business Software Alliance, a group representing US
software companies. According to BSA, about 25 computers containing illegal
copies of software programs were seized. It claims that software piracy cost
the industry Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn in lost sales last year.
