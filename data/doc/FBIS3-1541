  [Text] From 28 to 29 March, the Luanda government's air 
force attacked the (?Luembe), Mona Quimbundo, and Cacolo, and 
(?Muriege) regions of Lunda Sul Province, killing 47 civilians, 
including 27 children. This action reflects the warmongering, 
bloodthirsty, and unpopular nature of the Futungoland Creoles 
who have opted for a military solution to the conflict, despite 
the ongoing Lusaka negotiations. 
  The command of the patriotic and revolutionary Armed Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola in the northeastern region wishes 
to inform the Angolan and international communities that it will 
not tolerate the MPLA-PT's [Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola-Labor Party] armed provocations and will not be 
responsible for the consequences. UNITA is ready to negotiate, 
but will never give in to the MPLA-PT, a totalitarian, Marxist, 
and undemocratic party.
