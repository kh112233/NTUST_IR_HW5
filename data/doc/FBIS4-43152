<F P=106> [Report by F. Weckbach-Mara: "Nuclear Mafia: BND </F>
Powerless?"] 
  [Text] For a few weeks now, Russian mafia organizations 
have been in possession of the most important components for 
constructing nuclear bombs. They are thus in a position to 
blackmail Western and Arab countries. This follows from secret 
reports for the Federal Government. According to information 
received by BILD AM SONNTAG, this hot topic was discussed on the 
sidelines of a Cabinet meeting last Wednesday [8 June]. 
  Bernd Schmidbauer, minister of state in the Chancellery 
responsible for coordinating the secret services, told BILD AM 
SONNTAG: "There is a serious danger that criminal organizations 
can perform blackmail with highly toxic radioactive material. 
Therefore it is time for us to act." Western secret services 
fear that before long, mafia organizations will threaten to 
detonate smaller nuclear bombs or release highly toxic 
radioactive material. 
  U.S. President Clinton has already undertaken serious 
defense 
measures. In two weeks, the American FBI will open a bureau in 
Moscow to combat the nuclear mafia with the Russians. The 
Federal German Intelligence Service [BND] wants to participate 
in this cooperation, but Minister Schmidbauer says that 
important legal prerequisites for this are missing. "BND 
employees cannot examine radioactive material, nor bring it to 
Germany for examination," he says. "Yet accurate analyses are 
essential to assess and offset dangers. 
  "We require changes to the ratification law dealing with the 
physical protection of nuclear material, as well as an amendment 
to the nuclear law requiring nuclear material to be handled in 
this country," said Schmidbauer. "To offset major dangers to 
our country, we must participate as quickly as possible in the 
international combating of antimafia organizations, especially 
in Russia and East Europe."
