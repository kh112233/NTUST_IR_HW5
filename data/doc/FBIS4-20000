  [Text] Darmstadt (DPA) -- The investigations against three 
Hesse companies on suspicion of illegal deliveries for the Iraqi 
nuclear program have been ceased. Upon inquiry, the Darmstadt 
Public Prosecutor's Office announced on Monday [25 April] that 
the suspicion against the companies Du Pont Germany (Bad 
Homburg), Rittal (Herborn), and Balzers (Wiesbaden) has not been 
consolidated. Investigations are now still underway against six 
companies. 
  In 1992, the nine companies from the Rhine-Main area were 
searched by customs and public prosecutor's officials. 
Previously, IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] 
inspectors had discovered precision machinery, welding 
equipment, furnaces, and special oil in Iraq, the labels of 
which permitted the conclusion that they came from Germany. The 
equipment was obviously intended for the construction of a gas 
ultracentrifugue, which is needed for enriching weapons-grade 
uranium. In the cases that have been concluded so far, 
investigations showed, however, that the equipment was either 
not subject to a special permit or did not come from Germany.
