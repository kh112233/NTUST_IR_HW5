FT  07 OCT 92 / Israeli economy picks up
LATEST figures released in Israel show signs of improvement in the economy
which has been struggling with the burden of mass immigration from the
former Soviet Union.
The Labour-led government, which won power in June, is hoping the economy
has adjusted to the flow of some 400,000 immigrants since late 1989 and is
poised for a period of sustained growth.
Unemployment, which reached a record level of 11.6 per cent of the workforce
in the first quarter, fell to just less than 11 per cent in the second
quarter, according to official figures. Industrial production has, since
April averaged a monthly 1.5 per cent increase over the first quarter.
Aggregate first half profits of 330 publicly traded companies were up a
whopping 65 per cent over 1991.
Exports of goods have been ahead of last year by an average of more than 5
per cent a month since April. Tourism has recovered spectacularly from the
1991 slump induced by the Gulf war. It was up by 10 per cent in the first
nine months over the same period in 1990, before the Gulf crisis took hold.
Inflation, a perennial scourge, has come down to an annual rate of less than
10 per cent after totalling 18 per cent in 1991. Tax revenues were up by 8
per cent in real terms in the first nine months over 1991.
While GDP growth this year is expected to repeat the six per cent level
achieved in 1991, it will be greater in per capita terms because of a
slowdown in immigration this year. Officials also point out that in 1992,
growth has not been inflated by the state-induced construction boom which
accounted for about half output growth last year. They are encouraged by
evidence of increasing private sector investment, shown by a rise in imports
of capital goods.
There is a catch, however. The halving of immigration this year from the
150,000 who came in 1991 has eased the pressure on the economy, reducing
government budgetary problems, for example. If Israel's declared aim of
achieving a faster rate of immigration succeeds, the short-term effect may
be to blunt recovery.
