FT  07 MAR 92 / The FT Schools 500 (1):  Public schools that made the grades
 -How this special FT survey assessed the sixth form performance of almost
500 fee-paying schools in Britain
'ARE WE not setting the agenda for parental choice on far too narrow a
front?' Joan Townsend, of Oxford High, is not the only head teacher to
express reservations about school league tables. Yet the Headmasters'
Conference compiles its own table of examination results - although this is
not made available to parents of prospective pupils.
Tony Evans, head of Portsmouth Grammar (rated sixth in this FT 500 schools
survey) revealed the ambivalence of head teachers in his autumn term report
to parents: 'The A level results were very satisfactory, the overall pass
rate being 93 per cent, 59 per cent achieved at grades A and B. This placed
the school eighteenth in the Headmasters' Conference. However, I would wish
to repeat my comments at prizegiving that education is broader and more
humane in its purpose than the acquisition of the top two A level grades
alone.'
Independent schools clearly recognise the competitive value of a good
academic record, and most include detailed examination results in their
prospectuses. The problem for parents is that the information is often
presented in an inconsistent form, making meaningful comparisons difficult.
Our tables on Pages 7 to 11 address this problem by giving comparative data
on nearly 500 independent secondary schools in England, Wales and Scotland.
It is the biggest and most comprehensive survey of its kind, and although
not every school in the UK is included, we have taken pains to include all
which replied and which teach A Levels (or Highers in Scotland).
Previous surveys have ranked schools only on the performance of their best
pupils - schools were compared on the percentage of A and B grades attained
at A Level.
Our survey is the first to assess the results of all A level candidates in
the second year sixth form using the points system used by the Universities
Central Council on Admissions (UCCA). This quantifies performance of all
grades on the following scale: grade E, two points; grade D, four points;
grade C, six points; grade B, eight points; and grade A, ten points. We have
added all the points obtained to produce a combined UCCA points score for
each school.
Dividing a school's total UCCA points by the number of subjects entered
gives a measure of the success rate. For example if every pupil achieved an
A grade in every subject, the average UCCA score per entry would be 10. If
the average grade were a B, the score would be 8 and so on.
It would not, however, be fair to use this score per entry as the basis for
ranking all schools. This is because schools entering only their best pupils
for a narrow range of subjects would have an unfair advantage over schools
with a broader entry policy. On this measure, the Yehudi Menuhin School came
out second, beating Eton and Winchester. Previous attempts by newspapers to
rank schools according to their A and B grades are open to the same
objection.
An alternative measure of success is the average UCCA points score per
pupil. This, after all, is what most universities look at when assessing
candidates for entry. However this measure unfairly discriminates against
schools which limit the number of A level subjects to three and use the
extra time for optional subjects, which are not examined. Schools which
routinely enter pupils for four A levels could achieve a maximum of 40
points per pupil compared with only 30 for those entering an average three
subjects.
We have combined scores for performance per pupil and performance per entry
in an index which gives equal weight to both. This index therefore provides
some measure of academic excellence and of breadth.
Our tables also list separately the performance per entry, performance per
pupil and the average number of A
Turn to Page 2

level entries per pupil in each school. Although we have given a separate
ranking for each school (with some ties), many of the scores are close
together, so schools within a range of about 20 places may be broadly
comparable in academic standard.
Obviously, the ranking measures no more than standards at A level. Some
schools may have wider academic merits which the table does not capture. We
have, however, rejected the idea of broad groupings or league tables,
because these make arbitrary discriminations between schools at the bottom
of one league and those at the top of the next.
In spite of claims that General Studies is an easy exam which boosts the
results of schools that include it in their A level syllabuses, our detailed
findings show otherwise. We compared individual schools' average UCCA points
per entry both including and excluding General Studies. While some scores
went up when General Studies was included, others went down and many stayed
the same.
However, a good education cannot be measured by statistics alone, as Gillian
Ellis, headmistress of Streatham Hill and Clapham High (101 in our table)
emphasised:
'I accept that league tables are here to stay and in theory I welcome the
'debunking' which you are setting out to do. However, you are still
concentrating on facts and figures and nowhere can I see the questions which
would elicit the 'value added' factor.'
However, not the least of the virtues of the FT 500 is that it enables
parents to make their own judgments of value added. (For further details,
see the piece by Andrew Adonis on Page 4)
Many of the top schools in our survey admit only bright pupils, and many
schools with less impressive examination results do excellent work with less
gifted children. Their achievements should not be overlooked.
Chris Symington, financial director of Bury Lawn School, (rank 400) was not
alone in expressing concern about comparisons. 'We take the first children
to register, regardless of their ability. Our sixth form is also
non-selective and last year a large number remained, whereas anywhere else
they would not have even considered staying past the age of 16.'
Sibford, Banbury, is an example of another type of school that should not be
judged solely by its A level achievements. All students work for the City
and Guilds Diploma in Vocational Education, and while some also take A
levels its headteacher, John Dunston, sees the school as providing an
alternative path for those students for whom a three-A level course in not
appropriate. The A level results of specialist schools teaching, for
example, music and dance should also be treated with caution.
'We provide an unusually supportive atmosphere for children of all abilities
and strive to build in each of them a self esteem which may not be possible
in a more pressured, traditional academic environment.'
Whatever the value of academic scoring, schools should not be judged on just
one year's results. Gary Best, headmaster of Kingswood School, Bath (342),
supplied the previous two year's examinations results to illustrate the
point:
'Every year for the past decade, the number of A and B grades has been at
least 40 per cent of the grades attained. This year they were less than 20
per cent because of the pupils' poorer academic standard in comparison with
our norm.'
HOW SCHOOLS COMPARED
Our three top ranked schools - King Edward's (Birmingham), King Edward VI
High (Birmingham) and Portsmouth High - are all day schools. Looking further
down the list, day schools continue to lead the field: they account for 70
per cent of the schools in our survey; eight are in our Top Ten table, 15 in
the top 20, and 78 in the top 100. Winchester (4), Eton (7) and Wycombe
Abbey (13) were the top three boarding schools.
Single sex schools outranked co-educational schools. Boys' schools were on
top, holding seven of the first ten places, including the lead position
(King Edward's). Half the boys' schools in our survey admit girls to the
sixth form, but interestingly these were less well represented in the top
100 than those with boys-only sixth forms.
Girls' day schools came second, third and sixth in our top ten (King Edward
VI High, Portsmouth High and The Queen's School, Chester). The third, fourth
and fifth ranked boarding schools were for girls - Wycombe Abbey (13
overall), St Mary's, Calne, (17) and St Swithun's, Winchester (20), as were
11 of the 22 boarding schools in the top 100.
Nearly a quarter of the schools in our table were co-ed. None appeared in
the top 20 and only eight in the top 100. The King's School, Canterbury (55)
had the distinction of being the only co-educational boarding school of the
37 in our survey to get into the top 100.
Schools belonging to the Girls' Public Day School Trust deserve mention. Ten
of the 20 GPDST schools in our table are placed in the top 100 and two were
in the top ten - Portsmouth High (3) and South Hampstead High (15). GPDST
schools are among the least expensive day schools in our survey.
Girls at Portsmouth High had the additional distinction of achieving the
best A level grades: on average they gained nine UCCA points per examination
entry - midway between an A and B grade. Fifteen other schools scored more
than eight UCCA points per A level. The majority of schools in our survey
had commendable A level results - all but 14 schools in the top 200, for
example, scored an average of six or more UCCA points (between a B and C
grade).
Pass rates for the majority of schools were also impressive. A quarter had a
pass rate of between three and four A levels per pupil; a further half of
between 2.5 and three. Pupils at the Hellenic College, London (68) and Derby
High (112) averaged a remarkable 4.2 A levels each.
We have tried to compare schools on the proportion of pupils going on to
higher education. As any parent will find, reliable data is hard to come by.
Pamela Parsonson, headteacher of Francis Holland, London (255), for example,
quoted a figure of 54 per cent, adding that an unusually high proportion of
pupils were taking a 'year out' and that 80 per cent was a more
representative figure. However, many other schools simply supplied a figure
for the previous or a typical year.
Eight schools with good academic records chose not to complete our
questionnaire: Bedford High, Bristol Grammar, Cheltenham College (148),
Harrow (82), Hulme Grammar, Oldham (113), Norwich High (93), Notting Hill
and Ealing High (95) and Stockport Grammar (32). A few schools are unranked
in our table due to insufficient information.
We asked members of the public to write to them on our behalf asking for
their prospectuses and exam results. We have based their entries (listed in
the tables in italics) on these and other published information.
It is virtually impossible to draw performance comparisons between English
and Scottish schools. Instead of A levels, most pupils in Scotland sit five
Scottish Highers (though some take A levels as well). Some also sit the
Certificate of Sixth Year Studies (CSYS) in up to three subjects.
Furthermore, UCCA does not have a points system for Scottish examinations
(though Highers are recognised for entrance to English
Turn to Page 3

universities). Scottish schools are therefore listed in a separate table.
Variations in the examination courses offered by the different schools
prevented us from rating Scottish schools. However, where a significant
number of pupils have sat exams, we have given average points per Higher (A
= 8; B = 6; C = 4; D = 2) and average points per CSYS (A = 10; B = 8; C = 6;
D = 4; E = 2). We have also given average UCCA points per A level entry.
The three points systems are not comparable - a grade A at A level is not
equivalent to a grade B CSYS - and comparisons should not be made across the
three columns.
How deep parents have to dig into their pockets for their children's private
education appears to have more to do with the lavishness of a school's
facilities and endowments than its examination results.
Although Winchester charges almost twice the average fee for day pupils,
most of the fees of our top 20 schools are fairly typical and some, such as
Haberdashers' Aske's, Elstree (19) and Portsmouth High (3), are well below
average.
Fees vary widely around the country. The average fee at day schools in
Berkshire and Wiltshire is over Pounds 6,000 a year - double that in
Humberside, Tyne and Wear and South Yorkshire.
Half the schools in our survey charge the same fees for weekly boarders as
they do for full boarders.
The fees quoted in our table are those set at September 1991. Schools vary
as to what they include in their basic fees. Some schools anticipated rises
during the year. Most predicted a rise of around 10 per cent next year. Some
have a range of fees for different age groups (we have quoted the lower
end).
Increasing the amount of comparative information available to parents is
essential if they are to make an informed choice of school. Our survey
should go a long way to help parents narrow the choice.
Perhaps the last word, like the first, should come from Joan Townsend of
Oxford High: 'I am glad to see a newspaper collating more information than a
few brute grades, but depressed by the thought of the deluge to come from
elsewhere.'
