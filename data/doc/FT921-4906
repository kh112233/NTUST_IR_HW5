FT  06 MAR 92 / Zikes] It's that inventor again
SIR CLIVE SINCLAIR, the prolific inventor, yesterday launched an electric
bicycle which travels at a top speed of about 12mph, Ian Holdsworth writes.
The Zike was unveiled seven years after the spectacular flop of Sir Clive's
electric tricycle, the C5. The ill-fated C5 tarnished the reputation of the
man who dominated the UK pocket calculator market in the 1970s and virtually
created the home computer market in the 1980s.
'One thing we learnt from the C5 which we couldn't have predicted was that
people felt insecure because it was low down,' Sir Clive said. 'What we have
now is a true bicycle.' The Zike travels for up to an hour under its own
power or for longer with help from the pedals and can be recharged in an
hour.
Several companies made electrically-powered bicycles in the 1980s but these
were generally encumbered with heavy batteries and bulky motors. They
usually weighed about 75lbs.
The Zike is much lighter. It uses a nickel-cadmium battery and a motor based
on a new form of magnet. Both weigh about a third of their predecessors and
are concealed in the frame. Using aircraft-style alloys instead of steel,
the Zike weighs 24lbs.
It is assembled for Sinclair Research in Birmingham by Tudor Webasto, a
maker of car sunroofs, and will be sold in Britain from May for Pounds 499.
Sir Clive sees two main markets. 'One is for people who want to use it to go
to the shops or for local commuting and the other is for young people for
whom it might be their first powered vehicle.'
Since Sir Clive's company, Sinclair Research, sold its home-computer
interests to Mr Alan Sugar's Amstrad for Pounds 5m in April 1986, it has
acted only as a holding company for other Sinclair ventures.
