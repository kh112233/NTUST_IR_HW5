FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Bristol Myers to take Dollars
46m charge
BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the world's third-biggest pharmaceuticals company, is
to take a pre-tax charge of Dollars 46m in the second quarter following its
agreement to settle an anti-trust lawsuit involving claims that the company
conspired to rig the prices of infant formula.
The company's Indiana-based Mead Johnson division, which makes the infant
formula, yesterday denied the charges, but said it had agreed to pay Dollars
38.76m to settle a class action lawsuit brought by wholesale and retail
distributors who made the accusations about price rigging.
The decision to settle was made in order to avoid the burden and expense of
protracted litigation, the company said.
The Dollars 46m pre-tax charge will include the amount being paid to settle
the lawsuit as well as the estimated value of donating infant formula to a
US government agency as part of a separate settlement agreed last month with
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
The FTC had charged Bristol-Myers and two other infant formula makers -
Abbott Laboratories and American Home Products - with price rigging and
other improper trading practices.
All three companies denied any wrongdoing, but American Home Products and
Bristol-Myers agreed to settle, while Abbott said it would contest the
charges.
Yesterday, Bristol-Myers shares closed Dollars 1 off at Dollars 66.
