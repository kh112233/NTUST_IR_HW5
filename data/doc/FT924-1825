FT  16 DEC 92 / Business and the Environment: Purity in a cold climate -
Icelandic companies are trying to capitalise on a pollution-free environment
Bacteria which originated with the Vikings and 2,000-year-old water may seem
an odd combination on which to build a modern export-oriented food industry.
But skyr, a thick yoghurt-like product first made by Iceland's early Viking
inhabitants and bottled water from glaciers are just two elements of an
ambitious effort by Icelandic companies and government to exploit the
country's status as one of world's most pollution-free environments.
The strategy stems in large part from a sharp fall in recent years of the
cod catch - the mainstay of Iceland's post-war economy - and the subsequent
pressure on the government to develop alternative export industries.
Efforts at export diversification have also emerged from private-sector
companies frustrated at the small size of Iceland's domestic market.
New ideas range from massive power generation schemes to natural food
products and health spas. The common thread is that all capitalise on
Iceland's enviable environmental credentials and all are aimed at the
growing international demand for products and services that are 'pure' or
non-polluting.
Government efforts have concentrated on promoting Iceland's potential for
generating large amounts of cheap electricity through clean and renewable
means.
Only 10 per cent of Iceland's economically viable hydroelectric and
geothermal potential has been tapped, according to Landsvirkjun, the
national power company. It estimates that the average cost of power from
future hydro development for mainly industrial users would be lower in
Iceland than elsewhere, including large projects such as Itaipu in Brazil
and James Bay in Canada.
The government's priority is to lure energy-intensive industrial users, such
as aluminium smelters and other metal industries. It emphasises, however,
that any developments would have to adhere to strict environmental
standards, the costs of which it believes will be offset by secure access to
cheap electricity.
Landsvirkjun officials believe Iceland could also be a competitive European
site for the production of non-polluting hydrogen fuel for vehicles, another
energy-intensive process.
Research has also been conducted into the direct export of electricity to
mainland Europe. A detailed study of the likely performance of a proposed
500MW, 950km-long direct current submarine cable to Scotland will be
completed by the end of the year.
Landsvirkjun officials believe most technical obstacles can be overcome, and
that power from such a cable would be competitive in the UK electricity
market, even against relatively low-cost natural gas-fired plants. The
possible imposition by the European Community of a carbon tax amounting to
Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent would further enhance the
competitiveness of the project, the officials say.
They concede, however, that the unusual depth (up to 1,000 metres) and
length of the Pounds 1bn submarine cable, its high initial capital cost and
the long lead-time needed to build additional dams, power plants and the
cable itself considerably increase the risk profile of the project.
But the officials believe their greatest advantage lies in growing public
opinion in western Europe favouring electricity that is generated without
adding to greenhouse gases, but without having to resort to nuclear power.
Iceland is also hoping to sell its extensive experience in using geothermal
energy, which accounts for a third of the country's total energy consumption
and provides most of its space heating and hot water needs as well as some
electricity production.
Marketing efforts have been directed mainly at eastern Europe, with
particular emphasis on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, which Icelandic
officials say has tremendous geothermal potential.
Private-sector attempts to capitalise on Iceland's environmental reputation
are more modest but are generally closer to fruition.
The food and drink industry has been a market leader in exploiting the
'cold, clean and pure international image of Iceland,' according to Porarinn
E. Sveninsson, the director of the Akva spring water company based in the
northern town of Akureyri.
It has recently begun selling bottled water in selected northeastern states
of the US, even though the competition from domestic and European producers
is fierce.
Sol, a Reykjavik-based food and drink producer, also sells bottled water in
the US and Europe. But in addition it has succeeded in entering the market
for 'New Age' soft drinks, which eschew the use of chemical preservatives
and which place a premium on pure ingredients, especially water.
David Thornsteinsson, Sol's chairman, cites the success of the
Icelandic-canned Seltzer brand of fruit-flavoured drinks in the UK. Sales of
the drinks rose from Dollars 900,000 in 1990 to an estimated Dollars 2.9m
(Pounds 1.90m) this year, confirmation, Thornsteinsson says, that consumers
are willing to pay a premium for assured purity of ingredients.
He rejects suggestions that competitors could emulate Seltzer's success by
shipping Iceland's glacial water in bulk to bottling plants elsewhere. 'The
tanks and the need to process it at the other end would alter the taste too
much', he says. 'Besides, Iceland enjoys inexpensive back haul freight rates
to the US and Europe, so the cost of shipping the finished product is
minimal.'
Icelanders believe there could also be potential to emphasise the natural
qualities of more traditional food products, such as the country's
distinctively-flavoured free range lamb. Those raised along the coasts have
a diet consisting mainly of moss and seaweed, while those reared in mountain
pastures eat mainly herbs.
A study on establishing a big health centre in Reykjavik is under way,
according to Markus Orn Antonsson, the city's mayor, who believes the
absence of air and water pollution will appeal to European, and especially
German tourists.
