FT  27 MAR 92 / Green ship boarded by commandos
FRENCH commandos boarded the flagship of the environmental organisation
Greenpeace yesterday after it sailed into an exclusion zone around France's
South Pacific nuclear testing site, Reuter reports.
French military officials said the Rainbow Warrior II was intercepted within
a few miles of Mururoa atoll, where the crew had planned to land to set up a
'peace camp' to protest against nuclear tests.
The French said gendarmes and navy staff were in control of the ship and
there was no violence.
France has tested nuclear weapons since 1966 despite protests from Pacific
neighbours. French secret agents sank the Rainbow Warrior's predecessor in
New Zealand in 1985, killing a photographer. Defence minister Charles Hernu
was forced to resign after the sinking.
In Paris, environment minister Brice Lalonde, who once tried to sabotage
nuclear tests by sailing to Mururoa himself, said his Generation Ecologie
movement supported an international nuclear test ban.
France's other major ecologist group, the Greens, said it backed
Greenpeace's efforts to enter the South Pacific testing zone.
