FT  10 MAY 93 / Attack on German hostel for refugees
A HOSTEL for foreign refugees was firebombed and a graveyard for victims of
Nazi persecution was wrecked in the latest attacks blamed on right-wing
extremists in Germany, police said yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin.
No one was injured when a petrol bomb thrown at a refugee home in eastern
Germany on Saturday night failed to ignite.
Police could not immediately say how many people or what nationalities lived
in the hostel in Teterow district in the northern state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
In the state capital Schwerin, police said vandals toppled 81 tombstones at
a cemetery commemorating those who died resisting Nazi rule.
It was not known who wrecked the graveyard on Friday night. Refugees from
impoverished eastern Europe and the developing world, drawn by Germany's
liberal law on political asylum, have been the chief targets of brutal
attacks by neo-Nazis in the past 18 months.
