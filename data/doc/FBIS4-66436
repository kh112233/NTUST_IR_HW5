  [Text] [Nagoya] On 13 December 1993, Daido Steel Co., Ltd. 
(Daido Steel; president: Mr. Kanji Tomita), announced its 
successful development of a regenerative furnace system that can 
conserve energy and reduce emissions of CO[.sub]2[/] and 
NO[.sub]x[/] by more than 15 percent. With this development, 
Daido Steel plans to adopt what is the first regenerative system 
in Japan for the continuous steel-heating furnace at Kawasaki 
Plant (Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki City) and, subsequently, market 
furnaces using the regenerative system. 
  The newly developed system has two burners each of which is 
made by integrating a regenerator. The two burners are 
alternately operated for combustion and exhaust recovery. The 
heat of exhaust gas is recovered with the regenerator so as to 
maintain combustion air at a high temperature. As a result, the 
combustion efficiency of the system is said to be higher than 75 
percent. The system not only conserves energy, but also reduces 
the emission of CO[.sub]2[/] and NO[.sub]x[/]. 
  The regenerative burner that Daido Steel intends to adopt at 
Kawasaki Plant is manufactured by Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. The system 
at the plant is scheduled to be completed in March 1994 at an 
investment of &yen;90 million.
