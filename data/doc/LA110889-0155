SHORT TAKES; 
BUCHWALD LINES UP WITNESSES 
Humorist Art Buchwald will call several prominent Hollywood writers, including 
director-screenwriter Billy Wilder, as expert witnesses in his plagiarism 
lawsuit against Paramount Pictures Corp. 
In the $5-million suit, set for trial in state court next month, Buchwald 
contends that the Eddie Murphy movie "Coming to America" is similar to an idea 
called "King for a Day" that the columnist came up with in 1983. 
Both stories involve African princes who come to the United States and fall in 
love. 
The studio has denied the plagiarism allegations. Late last month, Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider denied a motion by Paramount to dismiss 
the lawsuit.
