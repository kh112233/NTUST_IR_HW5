 

(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in retrofitted household refrigerators.
See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal chillers. 

(c) R401A and R401B. R401A and R401B, which consist of HCFC22, HFC152a,
and HCFC124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC12 and R502 in retrofitted household refrigerators.
See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12 and R502 industrial process
refrigeration. 

(d) HCFC Blend Alpha. HCFC Blend Alpha, which consists of HCFC22 and HCFC142b, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC12 in retrofitted household refrigerators. This blend's components contribute significantly less
to ozone depletion than CFC12. However, the two components have the highest ODPs of all refrigerant alternatives,
and will be phased out under the accelerated phaseout schedule. In addition, the GWPs of the components are high compared

to most of the other alternatives in this end-use. Although this blend does contain a flammable constituent, testing
has shown that the blend itself is not flammable and that it must experience significant fractionation before flammability
becomes a risk. Given the small refrigerant charge size and the hermetic nature of refrigerators, it is unlikely for
a leak resulting in such fractionation to occur. 

(29) CFC12 Household Refrigerators, New. (a) HCFC22. HCFC22 is acceptable as a substitute for
CFC12 and R502 in new household refrigerators. See the discussion on HCFC22 under new CFC11,
CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in new household refrigerators.
See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal chillers. 

(c) HFC152a. HFC152a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in new household refrigerators.
HFC152a does not contribute to ozone depletion. In addition, HFC152a's GWP and atmospheric lifetime
are significantly lower than those of most alternatives. Although HFC152a is flammable, a risk assessment
demonstrated it could be used safely in this end-use. 

(d) HCFC Blend Alpha. HCFC Blend Alpha, which consists of HCFC22 and HCFC142b, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC12 in new household refrigerators. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted CFC12
household refrigerators. 

(e) R200b blend. R200b blend is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in new household refrigerators. R200b
does not contribute to ozone depletion. In addition, the GWPs and atmospheric lifetimes of the blend's constituents
are less than those of CFC12. However, the GWP of one component is high compared to those of other alternatives
for this end-use. One component of R200b is flammable, but a risk assessment has shown that use of R200b in household
refrigerators poses negligible additional risk of fire, given the hermetic nature of the equipment, the small charge,
and the low probability of ignition. 

(f) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to household refrigerators
using CFC12. Research and development efforts are underway to produce household refrigerators using this
cycle. Further information is discussed under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and
R500 centrifugal chillers.
