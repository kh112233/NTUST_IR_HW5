FT  28 JUL 93 / Currency change puts pressure on republics
RUSSIA appears to have achieved the main objective of its currency reform:
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, said yesterday the forced
exchange of pre-1993 roubles had compelled former Soviet republics still
using the Russian currency to opt in or out of the rouble zone.
He said republics which had remained members of the rouble zone - using
roubles issued by the Bank of Russia as their only, or parallel, currency -
had to decide whether to stay in or move out. The net effect seems to be to
have whittled the 'rouble core' down to six.
Before last week's currency upheaval five republics had already left the
zone; the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and
Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine. Only the Estonian crown can be described as 'stable'
while the Ukrainian karbovanet has been steadily dropping against the
rouble.
Four more republics have now given notice that they will leave the rouble
zone this year (though in practice these decisions are subject to delay).
Azerbaijan yesterday announced it would leave the zone as soon as possible -
the government has given its central bank two days to work out a mechanism
for withdrawing the rouble and replacing it with the manat - at present a
parallel currency.
Georgia has said that it will introduce its own currency from August. It
currently supplies coupons to supplement roubles and the government has said
citizens have one week to swap roubles for coupons, to a limit of
Rbs100,000.
Moldova has said it will now introduce coupons for all transactions and will
speed the introduction of the leu, which is being printed in Romania.
One problem in Moldova is its large Russian-speaking minority in the
self-styled TransDnestrian republic who have refused to switch to coupons
and still use the rouble.
Turkmenistan is to bring forward the introduction of its manat, from January
next year to October 1993. The manat notes and tenge coins are already
arriving in Ashkhabad, the Turkmen capital and are likely to be valued at
1:1 with the dollar.
Mr Mukhammed Abalakov, the economics and finance minister, said yesterday
the Russian move was a 'stab in the back' for the other republics, and that
they should have been given at least six months notice.
The remaining six republics, including Russia, have opted to remain in the
rouble zone, at least for now. Armenia has made the most fuss - Mr Levan
Barkhudaryan, the finance minister, said the cash exchange was 'a direct
violation of all previous agreements on currencies' but its economy is in
such a dire state that it can no nothing. Belarus has stepped into line, as
it usually does with Russian decisions. Citizens can exchange up to
Rbs50,000, but must put larger amounts in a six month deposit account at an
annual interest rate of 60 per cent. Mr Viktor Danilenko, the Belarus
ambassador in Moscow, rebuked the Russian government, saying that they had
dumped a 'railroad car' full of old notes on Belarus only a day before the
central bank announcement. He declined to say whether Belarus would bring in
its own currency.
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have both said they will fall into line, although
citizens can continue to use the old notes for the time being. Kazakhstan,
has said it will withdraw the old notes but it is awaiting a sufficient
quantity of new notes before effecting the switch.
