MORNING REPORT: ART 
The Netherlands is trying to organize the largest exhibition ever of Vincent 
van Gogh's paintings next year to mark the 100th anniversary of his death. The 
Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, with approximately 200 Van Goghs in its own 
storerooms, is planning to borrow at least 120 others from abroad worth an 
estimated $3 billion. The Kroeller-Mueller Museum in Otterlo, 55 miles east of 
Amsterdam, and from which two Van Goghs were stolen last December, will exhibit 
at least 230 drawings flown in from all over the world. Organizer Frits Becht 
said security would be massive during the four-month exhibition that is to end 
July 30, 1990, the centenary anniversary of the Dutch painter's death. ALEENE
