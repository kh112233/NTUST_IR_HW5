MAINSTREAMING HANDICAPPED SCHOOLCHILDREN 
I read with interest your column that dealt with the civil rights struggle of 
some parents to mainstream their severely handicapped children into regular 
classrooms. 
The general assumption here is that the regular teacher has the expertise and 
training to handle all educational needs. 
If this is so, why did I spend a lot of time, energy and money at the 
university level acquiring special education credentials? I'd like to think 
that my expertise is worth something. 
Regular teachers in my school in East Garden Grove are currently struggling 
with some of the highest caseloads in the nation (30 to 35 per class), not to 
mention the fact that many (of the students) don't speak any English. 
We now serve over 13 varying language groups and cultures! The teachers are 
fortunate to get an aide for one hour a day. Add to this the social ills of the 
neighborhood (gangs, drugs, and alcoholism). 
Yes, philosophically I agree that our handicapped children need good role 
models. Hopefully, their families contribute to this need. 
However, it is unrealistic and impractical to expect regular teachers to take 
on this additional responsibility. 
Are we prepared to offer all these teachers the critical teaching skills 
needed, to reduce their class sizes drastically and provide well-trained aides? 
Perhaps then we can address these parents' civil right concerns.
