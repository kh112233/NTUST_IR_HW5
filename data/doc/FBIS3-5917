  [Excerpt] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Cambodia's First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh said Friday [11 March] that his 
country will prohibit the import and laying of land mines 
effective immediately. 
  "On behalf of the royal government, I would like to say very 
clearly that we completely ban any laying out of mines," 
Ranariddh told reporters at the Japan National Press Club. 
  Ranariddh, in Tokyo to attend a meeting of the International 
Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC), also vowed 
that the Cambodian military will never again purchase mines. 
The announcement followed pledges by donor countries and 
organizations earlier Friday of more than 20 million dollars 
over two years to help Cambodia find and deactivate millions of 
mines. 
  Ranariddh cited a message from King Norodom Sihanouk, issued 
just ahead of the meeting, in which the monarch said "history 
will condemn extremely harshly those who plant such mines in 
Cambodia." [passage omitted]
