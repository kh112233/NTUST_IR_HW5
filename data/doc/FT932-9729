FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK's S Atlantic fishing licence
move will anger Argentina
BRITAIN PLANS to introduce a fish licensing regime for the South Georgia and
South Sandwich islands in the South Atlantic similar to the scheme operated
in the Falkland Islands since 1987.
Last week the UK government announced that it would extend the 12-mile limit
around the two island groups to 200 miles to halt over-fishing. British
officials said yesterday that new fishing regulations were being drafted
similar to those already being enforced around the Falklands.
Argentina reacted angrily to Britain's decision to extend territorial waters
and will be doubly displeased by a unilateral move to charge vessels for the
right to fish there.
Argentina claims sovereignty over the Georgias and South Sandwich islands as
well as the Falklands.
In statements issued over the weekend, Argentine officials said the new
200-mile limits would indirectly grant Argentina a role in fishing policy
because both island groups fell within the ambit of the 22-nation Commission
on Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, of which both
Argentina and Britain were members. British officials dismissed that
suggestion, however, insisting that they would not accept any Argentine role
that implied recognition of its territorial claims.
For the moment, the British announcement is only a formality as London lacks
fishery patrol ships to enforce the extended limits. However, officials said
it was considered important to announce it before the next fishing season
began in February.
Britain and Argentina are to hold talks on a new fisheries regime in waters
around the Falklands. No date has been set, but discussions are expected to
begin in May or June.
Argentina last year introduced a licensing scheme for ships operating in its
waters that is similar to the Falklands' regime and it has managed to poach
most of the islands' best customers by offering cut-price licences.
