  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin stressed again this afternoon that 
China has indisputable sovereign rights over the Nansha 
[Spratly] Islands and their waters. Vietnam will be infringing 
on China's rights and interests in entering into contracts with 
any oil company on prospecting and exploiting oil deposits in 
waters around the Nansha Islands, and such contracts are illegal. 
  Wu Jianmin made this statement at a routine Foreign Ministry 
press conference in Beijing in reply to a reporter's question 
about Vietnam's cooperation with the U.S. Mobil Corporation in 
recovering oil deposits in the Lanlong Sea. 
  Wu said: The Lanlong Sea lies within the waters of the 
Nansha Islands. China has always favored solving international 
disputes in a peaceful manner, and likewise, holds that the 
Nansha issue can be solved through peaceful consultations. 
  On Prince Sihanouk's planning to invite Khmer Rouge leaders 
to participate in new national elections, Wu Jianmin said: This 
is an internal affair for Cambodia. China hopes that all 
Cambodian factions will solve their internal problems properly 
and will achieve national reconciliation under the leadership of 
Prince Sihanouk.
