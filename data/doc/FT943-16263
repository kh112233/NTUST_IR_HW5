FT  05 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Free access to plant genetic
resources assured - Geoff Tansey reports on an agreement to put gene
collections under intergovernmental control
A new international agreement, guaranteeing equitable access to plant
genetic resources should be signed within a few months.
This follows the conclusion last Friday of the second session of the
Intergovernmental Committee of the Convention on Biological Diversity in
Nairobi, Kenya, where delegates agreed that there should be no intellectual
property rights governing the use of the 500,000 crop samples held in the
gene banks of 11 international agricultural research centres.
The committee gave 'strong support for finalising the agreement between the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the international
research centres as soon as possible'.
It will put the various collections under centralised intergovernmental
control under the management of the FAO's Commission on Plant Genetic
Resources.
The agreement means that the collections will not be the centres' assets but
will be globally-owned resources and the centres will manage them as
trustees not owners, according to Dr Geoff Hawtin, director of the
International Plant Genetic Resources Institute.
The centres will be charged with the responsibility of ensuring continued
availability of materials under free access.
There will also be no intellectual property rights (patents or plant
breeder's rights) on those materials in the collections, which mainly come
from developing countries, and this condition will be passed on to
recipients of the samples.
The institute has the lead role in dealing with plant genetic resources
among the 17 centres funded by the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research, an informal group of donors. Each centre, however, is
an independent legal entity governed by a board of trustees. Every year,
more than 120,000 germplasm accessions from the collections and 500,000
samples of improved materials are distributed by the centres, mainly to
developing countries.
The agreement has already been accepted by the FAO's governing council, the
commission and the individual centres.
The opening of the Nairobi meeting was overshadowed by accusations by some
non-governmental organisations that the World Bank was attempting to seize
control of the consultative group's activities regarding plant genetic
resources and to delay signing of any agreements until 1996.
These fears were rejected by Mr Ismail Serageldin, chairman of the
consultative group and a vice president of the World Bank, as based on
'fanciful guesswork not backed up by facts'.
However, Mr Henk Hobbelink, director of Genetic Resources Action
International (Grain) says that in a letter sent before the meeting he told
one of the non-governmental organisations that it would be 'foolhardy to
lock into agreements' before then.
In a statement issued to the meeting, Dr Serageldin said: 'The CGIAR is
committed to carrying out the responsibilities of trusteeship (over the
genetic resources in its gene banks) in concert with FAO and its Commission
on Plant Genetic Resources, and with the contracting parties to the
Convention on Biological Diversity'.
Mr Hawtin welcomes the 'clear message from Nairobi that says sign'. The
consultative group would like to sign the agreement but since it is not a
legal body it can only do so if each centre delegates its signature to the
group chairman. This is what is likely to happen, believes Mr Hawtin; but he
sees possible delays if some centre boards still have to meet to give
approval.
'I'd rather see a quick signature than delays,' he says, as would the
non-governmental organisations, which welcome the Nairobi meeting's call for
an agreement as soon as possible. They see it as an important step in
ensuring equitable access to the world's genetic resources.
