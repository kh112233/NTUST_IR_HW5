FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Genentech's profits meet
expectations
GENENTECH, the US bio-technology company which is 60 per cent owned by Roche
of Switzerland, yesterday posted third-quarter profits at the top end of
expectations and predicted earnings growth in 1994.
For the three months to September 30, Genentech recorded net income of
Dollars 15.5m, or 13 cents a share, up from Dollars 7.7m, or 7 cents in the
same period of 1992. Most analysts had expected earnings of 9 cents a share
in the quarter.
Revenues advanced to Dollars 165.4m from Dollars 137.3m.
Mr Kirk Raab, chief executive, said the improvement reflected the medical
community's acceptance of the value of Genentech's Activase heart drug.
Sales of Activase slumped in 1992 amid concern over its price and
effectiveness. They started to rebound this year after a study showed heart
attack patients had a survival advantage over patients taking a rival drug.
Activase sales rose 29 per cent in the third quarter to Dollars 63.5m from
Dollars 49.4m a year earlier.
Genentech also received a boost when an FDA advisory panel recommended
approval of Genentech's next product.
'Considering the fact that in August an FDA advisory panel unanimously
recommended approval for Pulmozyme (dornase alfa) DNase for treating cystic
fibrosis, we approach 1994 with continued expectations of growth,' Mr Raab
said.
For the nine months, Genentech earned Dollars 40.3m, or 34 cents on revenues
of Dollars 488.2m, against Dollars 14.6m, or 13 cents on revenues of Dollars
402.3m the previous year.
