SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Title XX of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300z, 

et seq., 

authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants for demonstration projects to provide services
to pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents, adolescent parents and their families. (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
Number 93.995) Title XX authorizes grants for three types of demonstration projects: (1) Projects which provide
``care services'' only (

i.e., 

services for the provision of care to pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents and their families); (2) projects
which provide ``prevention services'' only (

i.e., 

services to prevent adolescent sexual relations); and (3) projects which provide a combination of care and prevention
services. 



The Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs (OAPP) intends to make available approximately $4.5 million to support
an estimated 1015 new demonstration projects. An applicant may submit a proposal for a 

local 

care, prevention or combination care/prevention project 

or 

for a 

national multi-site 

prevention project with at least two sites in different States. The awards for care projects will range from $200,000
to $400,000. The awards for local prevention projects will range from $150,000 to $250,000. Funding for national
multi-site prevention projects and for combination care/prevention projects may be higher, in proportion to the
effort proposed. 

These grants will be awarded for a period of one year, and the availability of funding for later years is uncertain.
Therefore, we encourage applications from experienced organizations which are currently operating programs and
which have the capability of expanding and enhancing these services to serve significant numbers of adolescents
according to the guidelines specified in this announcement. 

Additional funds may be available in Fiscal Year 1996 and following years. If funds do become available, grantees
funded under this program announcement will be eligible to reapply for continued funding. 

Grants are funded in annual increments (budget periods). Funding for all approved budget periods beyond the first
year of a grant is contingent upon the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the project, and adequate stewardship
of Federal funds. A grant award may not exceed 70 percent of the total cost of the project for the first year. The non-Federal
share of the project costs may be provided in cash expenditures or fairly evaluated in-kind contributions, including
plant, equipment and services.
