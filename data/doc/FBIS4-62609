  [Text] TALLINN, May 16, BNS - Estonia had 19,522 
officially registered unemployed as of May 1, who make up 2.32 
percent of the country's population in the working age groups. 
  The total number of registered jobless rose only by one 
person from the preceding month, said Inge Rauba, chief 
spokeswoman for the Labor Market Department. 
  But as Estonia in the meantime shifted from its previous 
reference basis for the number of potential workers of Dec. 1, 
1991, to a new basis of Jan. 1, 1994, the jobless rate rose one- 
tenth of a percent to 2.32 from April's 2.22 percent, she added. 
The number of people in the working age groups at the beginning 
of this year was 840,790. 
  The unemployment rate as of May 1 remained highest with 8.4 
percent, or 3,824 registered jobless, in the northeastern town 
of Narva. Next came the southern Polvamaa and Vorumaa 
agricultural regions, both with 6.09 percent, and the 
northeastern Ida-Virumaa region with its capital Kohtla Jarve 
with 5.39 percent. 
  Only 670 persons, or 0.26 percent of the work force, were 
registered as out of job in Tallinn. Unemployment rates remain 
under the one-percent line also in the northern Laane-Virumaa 
region and the western Laanemaa region with its capital Parnu.
