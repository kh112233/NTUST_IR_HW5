  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- A plunge by Japan's 
economy similar to the relapse that occurred last year is "hard 
to imagine," economic planning chief Manae Kubota said Tuesday 
[22 March]. 
  This year has seen no comparable surge in the yen's value, 
which hit the apparently stabilizing economy last spring and 
contributed greatly to its subsequent declines, the head of the 
Economic Planning Agency told a regular press conference after a 
morning cabinet meeting. 
  Kubota declined direct comment on the October-December gross 
domestic product report that her agency is to issue Tuesday 
afternoon. But she noted that among the negative factors, such 
as weak corporate balance sheets amid the ongoing write-offs of 
bad debt, there is the emergence of such bright spots as 
apparent progress on stock adjustment, industrial production 
gains, improved sales of durable goods and pickups in tourism, 
machinery orders and in some segments of the auto industry. 
  Kubota also cited the apparent halt to declines in corporate 
sentiment reported in the Bank of Japan's "Tankan" survey taken 
in February. 
  Asked about the afternoon's quarterly economic report, she 
noted the mix of the bad with the good and said, "it's a barrier 
we must pass through step by step" before the economy can 
recover. 
  She acknowledged that the currency markets retain a "high 
yen 
tone," but said there have been "no big changes" in the yen's 
rate similar to the sharp rise starting February 1993 that saw 
it surge from around 120 yen to the dollar to the postwar record 
100.40 yen to the dollar in August. The yen "seems to be in a 
stable condition," she added. 
  Such gains by the Japanese currency pummel the 
export-reliant 
economy by pushing up export prices in terms of other currencies.
