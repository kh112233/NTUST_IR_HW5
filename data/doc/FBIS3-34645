  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Feb. 10, IRNA -- Foreign ministers of 
the contact group of the Organization of Islamic Conference 
(OIC) [Islamic Conference Organization, ICO] in Jakarta, 
Indonesia Thursday [10 February] appealed to the U.N. Security 
Council to forge effective measures to lift the siege of 
Sarajevo. Issuing a statement, foreign ministers of the OIC 
contact group including those of Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia, 
Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Egypt are currently in 
Jakarta to hold their annual meeting. The foreign ministers 
branded as "insufficient" the recent decision by the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The statement also called 
for a special session of the U.N. Security Council to find a 
just solution to the Bosnian problem. 
  The OIC also declared its support for holding of an 
international conference to find a just solution to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina problem. 
  Some 16 NATO member states in Brussels Wednesday threatened 
Bosnian Serbs with air strikes unless the Serbs withdrew 
artillery and heavy weapons beyond 20-kilometer range of the 
Sarajevo within ten days. The Serbian forces have agreed to 
withdraw their artilleries beyond the range of Sarajevo.
