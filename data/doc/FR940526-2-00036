n

-octanol produced by a new manufacturing process, the hydrodimerization of 1,3-butadiene.


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
