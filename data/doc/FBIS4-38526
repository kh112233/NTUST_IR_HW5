  [Text] Tallinn, May 25, RIA -- Russia's Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev addressed the Baltic Council session in the 
Estonian capital on May 24 to raise the issue of Russian 
military retirees in Estonia, Galina Sidorova, Kozyrev's 
political adviser, told the media. She said that Kozyrev handed 
in to his Estonian counterpart a letter received by the Russian 
Embassy in Tallinn. A group of retired military wrote the 
letter to quote examples of discrimination against them. 
Russia's foreign minister stressed that the retirees are all 
over 60. 
  He said he hoped that the institution of a Baltic council 
commissar for democratic institutions and human rights, 
including the rights of minorities, would help resolve the 
region's problems. He seconded the proposed candidature of 
Denmark's former justice minister Ole Espersen. 
  At the same time, Kozyrev expressed concern over what he 
thinks is insufficiently high efficiency of the Baltic Council's 
activities, especially on the issues of infrastructure and 
transportation. 
  The Russian delegation intends to circulate memorandums on 
human rights and economic cooperation as official documents of 
the session. 
  The session will continue on May 25.
