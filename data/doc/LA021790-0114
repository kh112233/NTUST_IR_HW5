CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
SENATE PRAISES MANDELA ON RELEASE 
The state Senate passed a resolution Friday congratulating Nelson Mandela, the 
South African anti-apartheid leader who was released this week after 27 years 
in prison. 
The resolution passed on a 23-6 vote, but only after an amendment to condemn 
the violence that Mandela's movement has sparked failed 15-16. The condemnation 
call came from Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin), and drew sharp criticism from 
more moderate senators, who labeled him a hypocrite and ill-intentioned. 
Doolittle blamed the African National Congress for a 1983 car bombing that 
killed 19 people and for periodic torture deaths of civilians.
