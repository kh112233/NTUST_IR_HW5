FT  29 APR 91 / France and NZ seek to make up
FRENCH Prime Minister Michel Rocard today begins a visit to New Zealand seen
as important in improving a relationship which for six years has been deeply
troubled.
Difficulties have included the Rainbow Warrior affair - when French agents
blew up a Greenpeace vessel of that name in Auckland harbour in 1985 -
irritation over French refusal to stop testing nuclear weapons in the
Pacific, and trade difficulties with the EC.
In turn, Mr Rocard's visit, the first by a French prime minister, is
important to the National party government of Mr Jim Bolger, which was
elected in December and wants to emphasise its desire to retain and
strengthen New Zealand's place in Europe just as France sees a similar role
for itself in the Pacific.
Wellington acknowledges that France gives essential aid to the economically
troubled small Pacific states, money that might otherwise have to come from
New Zealand. The government, obsessed with domestic economic problems of its
own, is happy with the French involvement and aware that it is based in part
on a determination to be some sort of counter to growing Japanese power in
the region.
There are also hopes that the visit will help improve trade flows running in
New Zealand's favour, mainly because of substantial agricultural exports,
notably wool. France has recently stepped up its investments in New Zealand
and has won business there, including landing substantial contracts, against
UK competition, to upgrade New Zealand's telecommunication networks over
seven years.
In its talks with Mr Rocard, the New Zealand government will be keen to show
a more conciliatory, less doctrinaire approach than the former government of
Mr David Lange.
However, Mr Bolger will have to tread warily, as there is deep animosity to
the tests.
