  [Text] The Science and Technology Agency' s National 
Aerospace Laboratory (NAL) announced on the 26th that they have 
successfully combustion tested their scramjet engine. An 
advanced engine, the scramjet is supposed to be installed in the 
manned space shuttle spaceplane' which is hoped to be operated 
commercially in the 21st century. Combustion time for the test 
model without coolant lasted only 6 seconds, but it was the 
first successful combution test in Japan. It is considered a 
big step forward toward the development of spaceplanes. 
  The test was conducted on 12 Apr 94 at the Ramjet Engine 
Test 
facility at NAL' s Kakuda Research Center (Kakuda City, Miyagi 
Prefecture) 
  The research engine used for the test consisted of a 
specially shaped copper alloy tube with a front air inlet 25cm 
in height, 2Ocm in width, and 2m in length. It was ignited 
under air flow equivalent to Mach 4 flight and a low pressure 
environment equivalent to altitude of 20km. Proper combustion 
of hydrogen fuel for 6 seconds was confirmed. 
  The scramjet is intended to fly at Mach 4-20 hypersonic 
speeds at high altitudes. It has a simple structure that 
requires no fans and turbines to compress air like conventional 
jet engines. Instead, air is shoved into the duct under wind 
pressure during flight at hypersonic speed and compressed by the 
forward motion of the engine. The air then passes through a 
diffuser and is mixed with hydrogen fuel and burned. Exhaust 
gases issue from the rear opening giving it thrust. 
  The engine used this time is intended to fly at lower speeds 
without coolant, NAL is planning to conduct combustion tests on 
a high speed water cooled engine prototype next fall. 
  Spaceplanes with scramjets take off from airports and return 
to earth after space flight. Every industrialized country is 
working toward their development.
