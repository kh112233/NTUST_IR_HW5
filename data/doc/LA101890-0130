SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: TEMECULA 
Two New York men were taken into custody early Wednesday by Border Patrol 
agents when a search of their rented car netted 294 pounds of marijuana valued 
at $882,000. 
According to a Border Patrol report, agents working at the Temecula checkpoint 
on Interstate 15 became suspicious of the pair and ordered them to the 
secondary inspection station. 
A dog trained to sniff out drugs alerted agents to the presence of several 
pounds of marijuana in two suitcases. A more thorough search of the vehicle led 
to the seizure of a larger load of the drug from the trunk. 
Border Patrol officials said that Stuart Reinhardt of Staten Island and Michael 
Palumbo, Jr. of Brooklyn were taken into custody at 12:15 a.m. The two men, 
whose ages were not available, were transferred to the custody of officers from 
the North County Narcotics Task Force.
