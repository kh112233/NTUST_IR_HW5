FT  11 JAN 93 / Observer: Sand-man
To judge by the frequency of people's claims to know how to do it, turning
water into motor fuel is a doddle. To go by the number on record as having
actually done so, however, it's rarer than the transformation of water into
wine.
The latest claimant is Professor Ilya Varshavsky of Moscow's Institute of
Theoretical Engineering.  'Beneath our feet is an inexhaustible supply of
fuel,' he says, referring to sand as a source of silicon. Apparently, if a
pinch of the latter is popped into the water-filled reactor fitted to his
Moskvitch limo, hey presto: out comes hydrogen to power the car.
'The basic research has already been done,' he told an interviewer from the
Russian Information Agency, expressing confidence that the process will be
widely used in everything from 'cars to the construction of a lunar base'.
Unfortunately, when Observer's colleague in Moscow called the institute for
clarification, he was told everyone was on holiday. Nor is the FT's science
correspondent entirely happy with the idea, saying that it's impossible to
see how silicon can generate hydrogen from water without an energy source.
One possibility would be a sun-powered photovoltaic cell made from silicon
which can produce electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Even
so, the device would at best be of little use during during Russia's long
bleak winter.
