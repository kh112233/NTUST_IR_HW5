project: (1) Would be located on a navigable waterway; (2) would occupy or affect public lands or reservations of the
United States; (3) would utilize surplus water or water power from a government dam; or (4) if applicable, has 
involved or would involve any construction subsequent to 1935 that may have increased or would increase the project's
head or generating capacity, or have otherwise significantly modified the project's pre-1935 design or operation.
