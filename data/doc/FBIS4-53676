  [Text] Sapporo, May 21 KYODO -- A group of 61 Russians 
from the disputed "northern territories" arrived in Nemuro, 
Hokkaido, on Saturday [21 May] under a visa-free exchange 
program with Japan. 
  Japanese officials said the Russians will go to Yokohama in 
Kanagawa Prefecture where they will visit Chinatown and other 
locations during their Japan stay until Wednesday. 
  The visiting group will also exchange views with the 
Japanese 
sponsors of their trip regarding the Russo-Japanese row over the 
sovereignty of Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai 
group of Islets, the officials said. 
  The group is the second Russian group to come to Japan this 
year under the three-year-old visa-free exchange program. 
  Two Japanese groups recently visited what the Japanese call 
the "northern territories." 
  Soviet troops seized the islands at the end of World War II.
