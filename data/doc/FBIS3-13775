  [Text] Cairo, March 18 (AFP) -- Four journalists at a 
magazine sympathetic to Moslem fundamentalists were detained for 
criticizing the government and urging Egyptians to protests the 
Hebron massacre, one of the writers said Friday. 
  The Al-Sha'b journalists on Thursday had to answer 
accusations they "incited hatred against the government and 
published articles threatening social peace and national unity," 
journalist 'Adil Husayn told AFP. 
  The four were also accused of urging protests over the 
February 25 massacre of 30 Arab worshippers at a mosque in the 
occupied West Bank town of Hebron, said Husayn, who is also 
secretary general of the opposition Labor Party, an ally of the 
Moslem Brotherhood. 
  The prosecutor of Egypt's High State Security Court will 
decide in the next few weeks whether to put them on trial after 
summoning the four on Thursday, he said. 
  The three others are Labor Party Deputy Chairman Hilmi 
Murad, 
Managing Editor Majdi Husayn and journalist Mustafa Bakri. 
  Husayn said it was "legal to criticize multiparty 
governments 
as Egypt says it is, but the detention of the journalists 
reveals totalitarian tendencies contrary to the constitution."
