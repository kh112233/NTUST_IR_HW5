FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: Schering shares soar on MS drug
boost
SHARES Schering, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, rose
sharply yesterday on news that its new drug to treat sufferers of multiple
sclerosis would yield higher revenues than expected.
The share price rose by DM54, or 6 per cent, to DM926.
The MS drug, Betaseron, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
at the end of last month, a move which also pushed up the shares. Mr Klaus
Pohle, Schering finance director, said in New York on Monday that the drug
should yield between Dollars 8,500 and Dollars 10,000 per patient a year;
the figure had been put at around half this.
Mr Pohle said Betaseron should produce similar revenues in Europe, where it
hoped for approval in 1995.
Analysts reckoned Betaseron could produce revenues of more than DM1bn
(Dollars 500m) a year within five years. Mr Mark Tracey, European chemicals
analyst at the London office of Goldman Sachs, said actual Betaseron
revenues would probably average up to Dollars 7,500 a patient after price
discounting in the US health service.
He said European revenues could be around Dollars 6,000 per person. In the
US, he said Betaseron could be used to treat nearly 90,000 MS patients out
of a total of more than 250,000, the figure in Europe being 105,000 out of
more than 300,000.
