FT  04 APR 92 / Food: Bargain buys when you are in France - Nicholas Lander
recommends some hotels and restaurants
THE FRENCH might not be the first to admit it, but the British have been
pioneers in discovering the country's hidden charms.
During the 19th century, when the French considered the Riviera far too hot,
intrepid British travellers settled there to get away from the miserable
British winter. The Promenade des Anglais in Nice was constructed at the
instigation of the Reverend Lewis Way, an Anglican vicar, in 1822.
Today, in northern France, the situation is the reverse. The French head
south in search of the sun, leaving the charms of northern France to the
Dutch, Belgians and British. The biggest marketing problem indigenous
hoteliers and restaurateurs face is that the consumers in their main
domestic market - Paris - consider northern France too cold, too evocative
of Emile Zola's coal mines, for their holidays.
Instead, since the 1920s, the British have been moving in steadily, bringing
their most favoured pastimes with them. Golf or horse racing at Deauville,
golf and a casino at Le Touquet where you can stay in the Westminster or the
Bristol; and wonderful gardens at Varengeville-sur-Mer.
Although the scenery is different, the weather has the effect of making the
British feel even more at home. The last time I was in Le Touquet, with a
film crew it, was raining so hard we thought we would have to abandon the
afternoon's filming. Half an hour later we were on the beach in weather that
could easily have passed for a summer's day.
As soon as the rain threatened, we did what has become the latest British
pastime in northern France, and dived into a restaurant for lunch. This part
of France now offers the quickest fix for anyone in search of the pleasures
of French cooking.
The fruits of the fishing industry still provide a living for a large part
of the local population (Boulogne is the fishing capital of Europe) and some
very sophisticated cooking, most notably at Montreuil, Cancale and further
inland at Caen and Rouen.
The increasing foreign presence can be seen in the restaurants' car parks,
where foreign number plates easily outnumber French ones. For anyone living
in the south of England, it is cheaper and easier to visit northern France
for the weekend than to discover the increasing number of gastronomic
highspots in Scotland and Wales. Furthermore, French restaurateurs have
always made eating out with children less difficult, first by accepting them
gracefully, then by offering a children's menu without fuss.
Since the recession has hit demand from the UK, French hoteliers have been
offering some attractive packages - at Chateau de Montreuil a winter package
of Pounds 55 per person for room and half board has maintained occupancy and
kept the restaurant busy. As the summer season begins, these deals will
disappear until autumn.
If, as the Chunnel will increasingly dictate, you arrive at Calais, the best
advice for the hedonists is to head straight out.
Go north to Teteghem, six kilometres from Dunkirk, to La Meunerie (tel
28.26.14.30); 40 kilometres south to the Moulin de Mombreux at Lumbres
(21.39.62.44); or along the coast to the more numerous restaurants which
surround Boulogne.
You can eat well at the Relais de la Brocante at Wimille (21.83.19.31); eat
and drink well at La Matelote near the port (21.30.17.97) - the proprietor
makes a point of matching different wines by the glass to each course; and
at the Hostellerie de la Riviere at Pont de Briques (21.32.22.81).
Further along the coast, in the Le Touquet area, there is the plush comfort
and excellent cooking of the Chateau de Montreuil (21.81.53.04), and the
very particular charm of Les Pecheurs des Etaples (21.94.06.90), where a
simple restaurant sits above a fish market alongside a quay.
For the distinctive cuisine du terroir (for example, freshwater pike and
perch), try the Bon Acceuil (21.06.04.21) at Attin, or Le Coq en Pate at
Argoules (22.29.92.09).
To the north of Dieppe the Abbaye de Valloires (22.29.97.55) offers
accommodation in a 17th century setting, and Chez Mado on the Somme estuary
serves cockles, mussels and its famous sole du Crotoy (22.27.02.22). In
Dieppe the specialities of La Melie (35.84.21.19) include a dish that
incorporates thin slices of kipper and smoked salmon. Along the coast there
is the Auberge du Dun (35.83.05.84) at Bourg-Dun, and at Veules-les-Roses,
close to one of the centres of French gardening at Varengeville sur Mer, you
can visit Les Galets (35.97.61.33).
The size and wealth of the population along the Seine estuary has created a
large number of good hotels and restaurants. These include the hotel Ferme
at St-Simeon (31.89.23.61), and the restaurant L'Assiette Gourmande
(31.89.24.88) in Honfleur. Deauville has Le Spinnaker restaurant
(31.88.24.40). In Bayeux there is the Lion d'Or (31.92.06.90), both to stay
in and eat at, and the Argouges (31.92.88.86), for those who would like to
enjoy a night in a former 18th century private house. Rouen and Caen boast
their own culinary heavyweights. In Rouen go to Gill (35.71.16.14),
L'Ecaille (35.70.95.52) or Le Beffroy (35.71.55.27), and in Caen, La
Bourride (31.93.50.76) and Daniel Tuboeuf (31.43.64.48).
The culinary star along the north French coast, for those who have strength
and stomach for the nine-hour ferry journey from Portsmouth to St Malo, lies
14 kilometres east of St Malo, opposite the magnificent Mont St Michel, at
Cancale: the Maison de Bricourt, run by Olivier and Jane Roellinger
(99.89.64.76). Specialities include Cancale oysters, lamb reared on local
salt marshes and, like any thoughtful French hotelier, a children's menu at
Ffr120.
