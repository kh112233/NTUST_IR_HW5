FT  14 SEP 92 / British Gas interested in Argentine state sell-off
thought to be worth Pounds 50m - for stakes in Argentina's gas transmission
and distribution companies when Gas del Estado, the state gas company, is
privatised later this year.
The company is interested in stakes in two newly-created transmission
companies and eight regional distribution companies. Final bids are due on
November 18, with stakes likely to be awarded soon afterwards. The Dollars
2.7bn (Pounds 1.37bn) sale of Gas del Estado is one of Argentina's largest
privatisations.
Gas del Estado has a 6,500-mile main transmission network - which is to be
split into two companies covering the north and south of the country - and
30,000 miles of distribution pipeline, to be split into eight regional
companies. It has 4m customers, and total sales of 600bn cubic feet a year.
British Gas already has two exploration licences and interests in four of
Argentina's producing oil and gas fields.
British Gas is keen to boost profits from its Global Gas business to offset
the effect of falling earnings from its UK supply business, where regulators
are forcing price cuts and accelerating competition. It already has
distribution projects in Turkey, Egypt and Indonesia, and a 5 per cent stake
in Verbundnetz Gas, the former east German gas transmission company, and
stakes in two German regional gas distribution companies.
