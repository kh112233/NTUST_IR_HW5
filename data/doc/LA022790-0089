WORLD IN BRIEF; 
COLOMBIA; 
DRUG DEALERS DETAIL SURRENDER TERMS 
Drug traffickers, fearful of extradition to the United States, said in a 
communique that they will surrender if they can be tried in Colombia. 
"We accept the decisions of Colombian justice, because we are subject to its 
constitution and its laws," the traffickers said in a communique published in 
the Bogota daily El Tiempo. The communique was addressed to a group of former 
Colombian presidents as well as church and political leaders. It was signed by 
"The Extraditables," the name adopted by leaders of the Medellin cocaine 
cartel.
