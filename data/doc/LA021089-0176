LOCAL; 
2 OC TRAFFIC VICTIMS IDENTIFIED 
Police have identified two motorists who died Thursday in traffic accidents, 
one of which officials blamed on rain-soaked roads. 
Glenn Cecil Calvert, 64, of Riverside was killed when a man driving north on 
Pacific Coast Highway about 2 miles south of Cameo Shores lost control of his 
Corvette, spun into the southbound lanes and smashed into Calvert's Mercury 
Cougar, officials said. 
Calvert was pronounced dead on arrival at Hoag Hospital Presbyterian in Newport 
Beach. CHP Officer Mark Mudrick said the accident, which occurred about 1:10 
p.m. was caused by the weather. Walid M. Albinali, 22, of Irvine, the driver of 
the Corvette, remained hospitalized Thursday with a chest injury and facial 
cuts. Albinali was not cited, Mudrick said, and police are still investigating 
the accident. Two other vehicles were involved in the accident, but neither 
driver was hurt. 
The Orange County coroner's office identified Linda Dianna Kinwald, 39, of 
Fountain Valley as the woman who was killed Thursday when she ran a red light 
and struck an empty Orange County Transit District bus at Harbor Boulevard and 
Sunflower Avenue in Santa Ana, authorities said. She was pronounced dead at the 
scene. The bus driver, 45-year-old Gloria Novotny of Anaheim, was not injured. 
No passengers were aboard the bus, which was out of service.
