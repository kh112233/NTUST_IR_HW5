POPE TO GET SCULPTURE 
Pope John Paul II is getting a special piece of the Berlin Wall, West German 
church officials said Friday. 
The wall remnant, sculpted into the shape of Berlin, is painted in the colors 
of the rainbow and held by a pair of bronze hands. It was created from a 
section of the wall by Cologne sculptor Egido Weinert, the Cologne archdiocese 
said in a statement.
