FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Malaysian tin miner to cut
dividend
MALAYSIAN Mining Corpor-ation (MMC), Malaysia's largest tin mining group,
has suffered its worst year since the 1985 collapse of the tin market and
plans to cut its dividend.
Group operating profits collapsed to MDollars 4.6m (USDollars 1.67m) from
MDollars 53m, following a loss on tin mining operations. Bolstered by
improved dividend income, pre-tax profits emerged at MDollars 81m compared
with MDollars 120m a year earlier.
Group turnover fell to MDollars 1.1bn from MDollars 1.6bn, despite
improvements at its associates where turnover rose marginally to MDollars
408m from MDollars 382m.
Attributable profit was 39 per cent lower at MDollars 83m. The group is
cutting its dividend to MDollars 14m from MDollars 19m, with a second-half
proposed dividend of 10 cents a share.
Perlis Plantations, the big sugar and flour group, yesterday reported higher
profits and turnover. Operating profit for 1990 rose by 32 per cent to
MDollars 168m (USDollars 61m) on a 28 per cent rise in turnover to MDollars
2.6bn.
Helped by higher dividend income, pre-tax profit increased to MDollars 204m
from MDollars 157m. The dividend is being held at 16 per cent.
