FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo plans Zantac to be over-the-counter
drug
Glaxo has confirmed that it intends to apply this year for a licence to sell
its best selling drug Zantac as a medicine which can be bought over the
counter without a prescription, writes Daniel Green.
In a formal statement of research and development, the company said it would
seek approval for two more versions of ulcer drug Zantac. One is a version
of the drug which kills bacteria that are thought to contribute to or even
trigger ulcers.
These steps are likely to be important in the attempt to maintain Zantac
sales at the Pounds 2.5bn it recorded last year.
Three more applications, all new ways to administer inhaled asthma drugs,
will also be filed by the end of the year.
Reviewing progress since the last formal R&amp;D update last November, Glaxo
said it had launched or gained approval for 15 new drugs or formulations
worldwide and three new compounds have started clinical trials.
After exploratory development, four new compounds are also under
pre-clinical testing, involving drugs to combat heart failure, pain, cystic
fibrosis and asthma.
Several, however, have been dropped since last November, including an
anti-herpes compound. Development of GR 87442, a potential follow-on to
Glaxo's successful Zofran anti-nausea drug, has also been discontinued.
