REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BAXTER HEALTHCARE TO SELL NEW BLOOD-CLOTTING DRUG 
Baxter Healthcare Corp.'s Glendale-based Hyland division said it will begin 
U.S. distribution of a drug made by Kabi Vitrum AB, a Swedish pharmaceutical 
company, for patients with antithrombin III deficiency, a hereditary disorder 
that impairs proper blood clotting. 
The drug, ATnativ, received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
last December for marketing as an orphan drug, the term used for treatments for 
diseases with a patient population of 200,000 or less. ATnativ has been 
available in several European countries for clinical trials since the 
mid-1970s. 
Baxter Healthcare is a unit of Baxter International, a major health-care 
products and services concern based in Deerfield, Ill.
