FT  02 SEP 94 / Cables to anchor Pisa tower
Scientists plan to anchor the Leaning Tower of Pisa to thick steel cables
buried deep underground to help stop it tilting further. Mr Michele
Jamiolkowksi, an engineer working with other experts to save the tower, said
yesterday that work on the project would start next month. It would involve
sinking 10 steel cables up to 50m below ground and anchoring them to a
reinforced concrete neck that would be built around the base of the 14th
century tower, which leans about 5m off the perpendicular. The scheme is a
temporary solution until a more permanent way to stabilise the tower's
famous slant can be found.
