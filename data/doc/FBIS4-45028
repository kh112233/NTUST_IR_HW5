  [Text] Tehran, 28 Farvardin [17 April] Central News Unit -- 
With the creation of facilities at the nation's airports, entry 
and exit formalities for passengers and the checkpoints for 
inspecting and monitoring passenger documents and luggage have 
been reduced. 
  Bani Najarian, deputy minister of roads and transportation 
and chief of the National Aircraft Organization, in announcing 
the above, added: The checkpoints for monitoring tickets, visas, 
passports, and luggage for passengers coming into the country 
have been reduced from five to two, and from 11 to four for 
departing passengers. 
  Bani Najarian added: In the near future all Iran's 
international airports will perform several monitoring tasks at 
one place, and will deal with passenger issues at another. 
  With regard to passengers departing the country, he said: 
Passengers leaving the country with tickets in hand will only be 
checked once by police and customs agents, and passenger luggage 
will also be inspected by inspection equipment. 
  The passenger greeting section is the next checkpoint. After 
that the validity of passenger visas is checked in one place 
instead of several places. At the last checkpoint, security 
inspections are done. 
  Thus the time spent passing through entry and exit routes 
will be reduced to the smallest amount possible. 
  Likewise, the services at the customs freight section and 
the 
general warehouse for transporting one-way freight and other 
freight coming into the country will operate on a 24-hour basis. 
  According to the deputy minister of roads and 
transportation, 
under a measure enacted at the 52d meeting of the National 
Administrative Council, the Facilities Committee on Standards 
and Assessing Airport Affairs is being formed to create a single 
management at the nation's airports, and it will pursue 
implementation of the aforementioned items.
