  [Unattributed article: "Czech Citizens of Slovakia"] 
  [Text] By the end of 1993, approximately 43,000 Czechs had 
applied for Slovak citizenship. This year, additional 
applications, which are routinely processed by the Slovak 
Ministry of Interior, are being received. Those that come from 
the Czech Republic get preferential treatment. According to the 
ministry, two or three applications on the average arrive daily, 
and their processing takes approximately one month. Slovak 
authorities demand that applicants furnish their birth and 
marriage certificates, an extract from the crime register, and a 
certificate verifying their permanent residence in the Slovak 
Republic. Bratislava has so far not made available any 
statistics on the number of Slovaks who have, up to now, 
requested that their Slovak citizenship be supplanted by Czech 
citizenship.
