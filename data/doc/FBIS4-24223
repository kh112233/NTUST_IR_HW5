  [Text] As factional fighting continues in ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], the West African 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] force is reported to have been attacked by the Mandingo 
faction of Alhaji Koromah in Brewerville, Montserrado County. 
According to reports, the attack by ULIMO on ECOMOG broke out 
when ECOMOG tried to prevent Koromah's Mandingo fighters from 
killing civilians whom they accused of being members of the 
Krahn tribe, their major rival. ECOMOG soldiers told newsmen 
that they had to fire back at the Mandingo fighters in 
self-defense, and eyewitnesses said Koromah's faction suffered 
heavy casualties. Scores of civilians are reported to have been 
massacred in the clashes. 
  Meanwhile, the Liberian State Council says those responsible 
for the massacre in Virginia and Brewerville areas will be 
brought to justice.
