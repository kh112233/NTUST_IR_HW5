CREATIONISM AND EVOLUTION 
In the 1930s, the Soviet Union rejected the scientific rules of heredity 
because they did not conform to communist dogma, and substituted an 
ideologically "correct" belief in the views of T.D. Lysenko. The result was a 
disaster for Soviet genetics, including crop breeding, since the Mendelian 
rules of heredity continued to operate in complete disregard for the dogma! 
We should learn from history: It is unwise to ignore the truth about nature 
because it does not match ideological or religious dogmas. But this is just 
what Shaver advocates. 
That life on earth has at least a 3 1/2-billion year history of hereditary 
descent with modification -- i.e., that evolution has occurred -- is a fact of 
nature with critical implications for all the life sciences. For example, an 
understanding of evolution and its mechanisms immediately explains the rapid 
development of resistance to chemical pesticides and antibiotics on the part of 
crop pests and bacteria, respectively. 
The evolutionary history of life is a "fact" in the same sense that it is a 
"fact" that the earth is round, not flat. The "fact" of evolution is based on 
overwhelming evidence from geology, paleontology, genetics, molecular biology, 
physics, morphology and other sciences. The evidence is internally consistent, 
in spite of attempts by scientists to find inconsistencies (science is a 
process by which our understanding of nature is constantly re-evaluated in 
light of new evidence). 
Shaver misrepresents the scientific process and the depth and richness of our 
knowledge about the evolutionary past and about the mechanisms that cause 
evolution. We would seriously mislead our children by withholding this 
important knowledge from them, and by teaching them that science and religious 
dogma are interchangeable.
