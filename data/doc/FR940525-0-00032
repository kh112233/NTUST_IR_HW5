 

X. Rural Health Clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers 



A. Legislative Provision 



Under section 1861(aa) of the Act, Medicare pays for services furnished in certain qualified health centers that
are known as Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). Each center is: An entity that is receiving a grant under
section 329, 330, or 340 of the Public Health Service Act or is under contract with the recipient of a grant under section
329, 330, or 340 of the Public Health Service Act and meets the requirements for receiving such a grant; or is determined,
based on the recommendations of the Health Resources and Services Administration within the Public Health Service,
to meet the requirements for meeting such a grant; or was treated by the Secretary as a comprehensive Federally funded
health center as of January 1, 1990. Section 13556 of OBRA 93 amended section 1861(aa)(4) of the Act to include as FQHCs
outpatient programs and facilities operated by Indian tribes or tribal organizations under the Indian Self-Determination
Act (25 U.S.C. 450). The amendment took effect as if included in the enactment of section 4161(a)(2)(C) of OBRA 90,
which was effective October 1, 1991. Section 13556 of OBRA 93 also provides that an outpatient health program or facility
operated by an urban Indian organization receiving funds under Title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25
U.S.C. 1601ff) is included in the Medicare program, effective October 1, 1991. 



B. Regulations Revision



We are adding a new paragraph to the definition of Federally qualified health centers in 405.2401(b) to include
outpatient health programs and facilities operated by Indian tribes under the Indian Self-Determination Act or
by urban Indian organizations under title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. 



XI. Reduction in Payments for Epoetin 



A. Legislation 



Medicare is the principle purchaser of epoetin (EPO), an anti-anemia drug used by dialysis patients with a specified
level of anemia. Section 1881(b)(11)(B) of the Act provides that payments to ESRD facilities are made based on increments
of 1,000 unit doses, rounded to the nearest 100 units, with a maximum payment of $11 per 1,000 units. Under section 1861(s)(2)(P)
of the Act, Medicare considers as a medical or other health service EPO for home dialysis patients competent to use
the drug in the home without medical or other supervision, subject to methods and standards established by the Secretary
by regulation for the safe and effective use of the drug, and items related to the use of the drug. 

Section 13566 of OBRA 93 decreased the maximum payment for EPO to $10 per 1,000 units. OBRA 93 also amended section 1861(s)(2)(P)
to remove the word ``home'' from ``home dialysis patients'', the effect of which is to allow coverage of EPO when used
at home by dialysis patients who do not dialyze at home. The effective date of section 13566 of OBRA is January 1, 1994.




B. Regulations Revision 



The change in payment rate requires no revision to regulations because we announce the rate in a notice published in
the 

Federal Register

 rather than in regulations. To implement the provision allowing dialysis patients who do not dialyze at home to use
EPO in the home, we are revising 405.2137, 405.2163, 410.10(k), and 410.52 to show the effective dates
of the various sections for use of EPO at home by patients who do not dialyze at home.
