FT  23 AUG 93 / Leftist gunmen seize group of journalists covering the
stand-off
LEFTIST gunmen holding hostage Nicaragua's vice-president and a score of
other political leaders yesterday seized a group of journalists covering the
stand-off, local radio reports said, Reuter reports from Managua.
'The party is over, this is not a picnic,' said the gunmen's leader,
identifying himself as Commando 31 (pictured in negotiations at the weekend
with former Sandinista president Daniel Ortega). 'We are going to harden our
positions.'
The gunmen, leftist sympathisers of the former ruling Sandinista party, took
hostage Vice-President Virgilio Godoy and other National Opposition Union
leaders on Friday night in response to an earlier kidnapping of government
officials and Sandinista politicians by a group of Contra guerrillas in
northern Nicaragua.
Commando 31 said yesterday after releasing 14 of about 35 hostages that no
more would be freed until the Contras reciprocated. The Contras have ruled
this out, insisting President Violeta Chamorro sack General Humberto Ortega,
army chief and brother of Daniel Ortega.
