FT  25 NOV 93 / Drug tests offer new Aids hope
A possible new approach to Aids treatment has emerged from laboratory tests
at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, of a drug being developed to treat
cancer.
Scotia, a UK pharmaceutical company, said yesterday that its anti-cancer
compound EF13 killed white blood cells infected with HIV. The compound did
not harm uninfected cells, and made them more resistant to HIV infection.
The next stage will be to hold clinical trials for EF13 as an Aids drug,
which could take several years to com-plete.
The drug is the lithium salt of a fatty acid extract from evening primrose
oil. It is believed to kill infected cells by generating lethal levels of
free radicals.
