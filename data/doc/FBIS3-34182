  [Text] Condemnation of assassination and violence in all 
its forms, be it against Algerians or foreigners, the list will 
not end as long as more names continue to fall. Here is more 
with Nassira Ait Saleh: 
  [Ait Saleh] The list of victims is growing longer. The 
bloodletting of the best Algerians continue; even foreigners 
have not been spared. 
  The wantonness of terrorism cannot be explained, save by the 
logic of blind madness, which aims at destabilizing the country 
and desecrating the right to live. 
  Terrorism does not exclude anyone; intellectuals, 
journalists, civilians, policemen, gendarmes, and soldiers have 
all been a target for the bullets of terrorism, merely because 
they are one of Algeria's symbols. 
  Two days ago, two foreign journalists were also the victims 
of terrorism. One was killed instantly and the other was 
seriously wounded. This took place at the Casbah of Algiers -- 
at what should be a symbolic and welcoming quarter, an 
international historical monument. 
  This hemorrhage must stop. Algeria will remain steadfast, 
thanks to its sons, who are producing, resisting, and also 
dying.
