<F P=106> [Studio interview with the new Federal Public Prosecutor Kay </F>
Nehm by Peter Ellgaard in Mainz on 13 February; announced as 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ellgaard] You seem to have 
years of experience with right-wing extremism. What are the 
reasons? It is striking that the incidence of right-wing 
extremist violence have increased since reunification. 
  [Nehm] When I first went to eastern Germany to monitor the 
public prosecutor there to see what tasks we might be facing, I 
realized that there was an enormous potential of aggression in 
the streets. I told the authorities, saying that we might have 
to deal with something we had not known up to then; and 
unfortunately this has become true. 
  [Ellgaard] But bans do not seem to elicit the desired 
results, as we have just heard. What must be done to fight 
right-wing extremism more efficiently? 
  [Nehm] Bans always have the disadvantage that the structures 
of those banned are then no longer discernible. The great 
advantage of openly fighting this form of violence is that the 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution can get an insight 
into the structures, can more easily infiltrate them to see what 
goes on.[passage omitted] 
  [Ellgaard] Are you prepared for possible attacks against 
this state from the right-wing extremist scene, in the manner of 
the leftist RAF [Red Army Faction]? 
  [Nehm] There have always been attacks. The difference was 
that they have not always been directed, in the sense of a 
particular attitude. With the RAF, the objects were always 
representatives of the state, industry, etc.. With right-wing 
violence, it has been violence as such, in order to get 
attention. Whether this might take other forms, I do not know. 
But let me come back to our responsibility. If right-wing 
violence takes forms similar to those of the RAF, we will pursue 
these things with the same consistency. 
  [Ellgaard] What are your possibilities of becoming active 
across borders? After all, there is an international network on 
this scene now. 
  [Nehm] There has always been such a network. Just remember 
the stickers that came over from America in the 70's. We have 
always had to keep an eye on what spills over to the Federal 
Republic. In Belgium, in all the countries around us, this 
phenomenon can be observed. What is particularly alarming for 
us is that we experienced the past of the Third Reich with 
organized extermination of minorities and other nations, murder 
organized by the government; and I think we have every reason to 
be averse to this. And this is the disgraceful thing about 
these pictures, that people do not seem to have learned a thing 
from the past. [passage omitted]
