SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of April 22, 1993 (58 FR 21583), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2B4341) had been filed by Milliken
Chemical, c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001, proposing that 178.3295 

Clarifying agents for polymers

 (21 CFR 178.3295) be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol as a clarifying agent in
polypropylene articles intended for use in contact with food. 


Upon further review of the petition, the agency noted that the petitioner had requested use of the additive as a clarifying
agent in high-propylene olefin copolymers in addition to its use in polypropylene films. In a notice published in
the 

Federal Register

 of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 307), FDA amended the filing notice of April 22, 1993, to state that the petitioner had requested
that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol as a clarifying
agent in polypropylene and high-propylene olefin copolymers for use in contact with food.
FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed use of the
food additive is safe and that the regulations in 178.3295 should be amended as set forth below.
In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before (

insert date 30 days after date of publication in the 

Federal Register

), file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately
numbered, and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which
objection is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall
specifically so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the
right to a hearing on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed
description and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection
in the event that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection
shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted
and shall be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received
in response to the regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through
Friday.
