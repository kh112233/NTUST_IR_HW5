  [Excerpts] BANGKOK, Jan 23 (AFP) -- Long an irresistable 
magnet for visiting journalists and tourists alike, the high 
profile soldiers and security police guarding the Rangoon home 
of Burma's most high-profile dissident Aung San Suu Kyi have 
been withdrawn, diplomats there said Sunday. 
  An AFP reporter in Rangoon confirmed the armed guards and 
wooden guard boxes on either side of the entrance to her home 
had been removed. But security remained tight outside the house 
and there was no indication the status of the 1991 Nobel Peace 
Prize winner -- who has been under house arrest since July 20, 
1989 -- had changed. 
  The section of the road leading to her lakeside compound on 
University Avenue remained barricaded to traffic at night and 
security inside the house was believed to still be tight as well. 
  The military government did not announce the move and 
Burmese 
officials could not be reached for comment. But sources said 
the junta probably was tired of scores of foreign reporters 
visiting the house and taking forbidden photographs, and the 
removal of the uniformed guards and police likely was intended 
to make the house look more like others in the area. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Rangoon government has said the diminutive dissident, 
the 
daughter of Burmese independence hero Aung San, may end her 
"restriction" any time she wants -- as long as she leaves Burma. 
But Aung San Suu Kyi has refused to go into exile, knowing her 
continued detention attracts worldwide attention.
