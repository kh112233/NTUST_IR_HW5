  [Text] Two days of economic discussions between 
delegations from Israel, Jordan, and the United States ended 
last night in Washington. Our Washington correspondent Arye 
Golan has learned that the Jordanians are not prepared to engage 
in joint projects with Israel before progress is made in the 
negotiations between Israel and Syria and the outstanding 
problems between Israel and Jordan are solved. These problems 
are: the Palestinian refugees, use of the water sources, and 
areas in the 'Arava that Jordan claims to own. Our 
correspondent reports that Israeli and Jordanian experts 
discussed ways to prevent drug trafficking between the two 
countries. 
  In addition, another week of peace talks between Israeli 
representatives and delegations from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and 
the Palestinians ended in Washington. Deputy Foreign Minister 
Yosi Beilin said the talks between Israel and Jordan were the 
most successful. 
  On the Palestinian track, Major General Dani Rothschild and 
Sa'ib 'Urayqat began discussing the modalities of the elections 
to the autonomy council. They were joined by Ehud Shilat, the 
Interior Ministry's national supervisor of elections.
