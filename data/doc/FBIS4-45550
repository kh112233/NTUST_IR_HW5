  [Excerpts] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo announced 
yesterday that the military naval fleet will be expanded to 
"guard our seas and coasts" from smugglers, pirates, and drug 
traffickers. 
  The announcement was made during a meeting with 
representatives of the fishing, business, labor, livestock, and 
transportation sectors, as well as the mayors of the Northern 
Atlantic Autonomous Region [RAAN]. During the meeting held at 
the National Technological Institute installations in Puerto 
Cabezas, Minister Lacayo responded to concerns voiced by 
representatives of the Moravian and Adventist Churches regarding 
the drug problem, which is affecting the area's population, 
especially youths. 
  Lacayo's decision triggered thunderous applause from 
attendees at the meeting, which was held following a private 
meeting between Lacayo and delegates of government institutions 
in the RAAN. [passage omitted]
