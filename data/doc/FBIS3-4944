  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 3 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Thursday that a statement by 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd Wednesday confirmed that 
the British media actually published stories which were untrue 
and figments of the imagination to smear the name of Malaysian 
leaders. 
  Describing Hurd's statement to the House of Commons foreign 
affairs select committee as good, Abdullah said it confirmed 
Malaysia's view that the British media did not have an 
understanding of what it reported. 
  He (Hurd), therefore, understands why Malaysia had to take 
such action (to stop awarding any more government contracts to 
British companies), Abdullah told reporters. 
  Hurd was reported to have said that the British media 
reports 
on the Pergau dam and claims related to it were creatures of 
fancy and that many of those who write evidently live far from 
the real world in which we want Britain to thrive. 
  Hurd had also described the British media allegations 
against 
the dam project as swirls of speculative allegations with no 
connection with the Pergau project. He had also said that the 
British media allegations had severly damaged British interests, 
particularly in trade. 
  The Malaysian Government announced last Friday that the 
cabinet had decided to stop awarding any more government 
contracts to British companies following allegations the British 
media had hurled incessantly at Malaysian leaders, including 
Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed.
