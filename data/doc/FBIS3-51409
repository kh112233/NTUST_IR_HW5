  [Text] It has been officially announced in Santo Domingo 
that Cuba has become a full member of the Caribbean Hotel 
Association by unanimous vote of the members of the executive 
committee of this body. The announcement was made on 17 January 
by (Bel Hoberman), a representative of the association, during 
the Market Place-94 event being held in the Jaragua Hotel with 
the participation of over 1,000 delegates and travel agents from 
Central America and the Caribbean. 
  Caribbean tourism officials believe Cuba's entry into the 
association is extremely important in light of the significant 
growth Cuba has experienced in this sector in the last few years 
and its potential. For years Cuba sought to become a member of 
the Caribbean Hotel Association headquartered in Puerto Rico.
