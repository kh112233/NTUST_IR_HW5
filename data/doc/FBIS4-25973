  [Text] Shanghai, June 15 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai City will 
hold a fair for promotion of tourist commodities from mid-June 
to early 1995. 
  Wang Naili, director of the Shanghai Tourist Bureau, 
announced the plan at a press conference today. 
  He said that in the past two years, tourism services in 
Shanghai have seen rapid growth. Last year, about 1.25 million 
overseas tourists visited Shanghai, and the income in foreign 
currency increased by 49.7 percent over the previous year. 
  In the first five months this year, the city has received 
472,700 overseas tourists, an increase of 3.1 percent over the 
corresponding period last year. 
  However, Wang said, Shanghai's income from the sales of 
tourist commodities is on the decline. 
  Shanghai lacks commodities with Shanghai characteristics, he 
said. 
  The quality, packaging, and varieties of commodities are 
expected to be improved, he added. 
  The Shanghai Municipal Government decided to mobilize 20 
departments to jointly sponsor the Shanghai International 
Tourist Commodities Fair over the next few months. 
  The serial includes a new products show and a competition of 
the best ideas on the improvement of tourist commodities, a 
symposium on development of tourist commodities, a knowledge 
contest and selection of the ten best department stores.
