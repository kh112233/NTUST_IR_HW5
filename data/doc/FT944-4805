FT  07 DEC 94 / Australian price-fixing case
The Australian transport group Mayne Nickless, and a number of its present
and former executives, yesterday agreed to settle a price-fixing case
brought against it by the Trade Practices Commission (TPC), Australia's
competition watchdog. Mayne Nickless was ordered to pay ADollars 7.7m
(Pounds 3.8m) in penalties and costs. Executives on whom penalties were
imposed included Mr William Bytheway, Mayne's managing director. The company
said it had discontinued the defence 'reluctantly'. The prospect of a long
court case would have 'absorbed enormous management resources', it said.
The TPC had alleged that Mayne, together with TNT Australia and Ansett
Transport Industries, ran a cartel in the express freight industry from the
1970s to the early 1990s. It alleged that the companies, with an aggregate
90 per cent market share, had arrangements not to poach each other's
clients. If a customer did switch carriers, the new carrier 'burnt' the
client, by raising rates or providing poor service, so that the client
returned to the original service provider.
