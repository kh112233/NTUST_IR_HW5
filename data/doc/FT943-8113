FT  19 AUG 94 / Spanish fishermen open fire
Spanish fishermen fired at French trawlers in the Bay of Biscay yesterday,
wounding one Frenchman, in the latest clash of the Atlantic tuna war, the
fishing ministry said in Paris. Mr Pierre Drege said five Spanish boats
attacked four French ones about 45 nautical miles off Cap Breton in
southwest France early in the morning. The wounded fisherman, Mr Gilles
Tanguy, had undergone surgery and was in stable condition. 'It was
gratuitous aggression. . . the French boats were fishing with nets that were
totally authorised, not the (long drift) nets that have caused problems
recently,' Mr Drege said. The international battle over tuna fishing
practices has been raging since the start of the summer, when Spanish boats
seized a French trawler and towed it back to their home port in an attempt
to prove to EU inspectors that its nets violated regulations.
