Extension of Time Period for Notice of Prospective Grant of Exclusive Patent License.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

In the Federal Register on January 20, 1994 (59 FR 3072), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (``NIST''),
U.S. Department of Commerce, issued a notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that
NIST was contemplating the grant of an exclusive license in the United States to practice the invention embodied in
U.S. Patent Number 5,295,176, titled ``Method and Apparatus for Precisely Measuring Voltages Applied to X-Ray Sources''
to Radcal Corporation, having a place of Business in Monrovia, California. In the course of negotiations with Radcal
Corporation, additional matters have arisen which may affect the prospective license, and which NIST wishes to bring
to the attention of potential respondents through this notice.

<DATE>
DATES:

 Any party wishing to apply for a license under U.S. Patent Number 5,295,176 or wishing to oppose the grant of the license

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

As announced in the earlier Federal Register notice, the prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing
and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive license may
be granted unless, within thirty days from the date of this published notice, NIST receives written evidence and argument
that the grant of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.




NIST now wishes to inform the public that in addition to the above identified license, NIST is willing to enter into
a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (``CRADA'') to perform further research on the invention for the
purposes of commercialization. This CRADA will be conducted by NIST without any additional charge to whatever party
or parties license the patent. Further, NIST is willing to grant to the licensee or licensees an option to negotiate
for royalty-free exclusive licenses for any jointly owned patents which occur under the CRADA which are improvements
on U.S. Patent Number 5,295,176, as well as an option to negotiate for exclusive royalty-bearing licenses for NIST
employee inventions which occur under the CRADA.

U.S. Patent Number 5,295,176 provides a method of precisely measuring the accelerating voltage applied to an x-ray
tube using a simple apparatus with a direct reading taken from a spectrographic image of the radiation produced by
the x-ray tube.

The availability of the invention for licensing was published in the Federal Register, Vol. 58, No. 93 (May 17, 1993).
A copy of the patent may be obtained from NIST at the foregoing address.
