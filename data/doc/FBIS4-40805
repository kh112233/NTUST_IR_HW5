"FBI Chief To Visit Us"] 
  [Text] FBI Director Louis Freeh will be visiting Moscow 
from 3 through 6 July (incidentally, he will also celebrate 
American Independence Day here) at the official invitation of 
Internal Affairs Minister Viktor Yerin. During the visit he 
will take in various Russian Federation MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] structures, the Russian Justice Ministry, the 
General Prosecutor's Office, the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service, and the Foreign Ministry with his assistants and 
advisers, and will also be talking to students at the MVD 
Academy. The signing of a protocol on opening an official FBI 
office in Moscow is also scheduled. The "G-men" will have their 
own office on a floor of the U.S. Embassy equipped with the most 
modern methods of communicating with Washington. 
  "We have been on friendly terms with the FBI for three years 
now," Mikhail Yegorov, chief of the Russian Federation MVD Main 
Administration for Combating Organized Crime, said. "We are 
cooperating in the fight against the mafia, which operates in 
both Russia and the United States. Currently our administration 
is pursuing over 30 criminal cases with the FBI -- we are 
investigating the activity of 30 Russian criminal groups closely 
linked to the American mafia, mainly in the sphere of major 
financial irregularities. We are looking for both the criminals 
and 'dirty' money leaving our country. In Moscow we will 
discuss tactics for joint work and summarize the results of what 
has been done." 
  The upcoming meeting is not the first in the history of the 
MVD and FBI. There were such meetings the year before last and 
last year, and this past winter Yegorov "went to the States 
himself."
