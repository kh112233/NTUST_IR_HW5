FT  02 AUG 93 / S African township clash kills 30
AT LEAST 30 people were killed in a South African township clash,
overshadowing efforts to woo black and white conservatives back to democracy
talks, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
Residents and police said fighting began when hostel dwellers, most of them
members of the Zulu-dominated Inkatha Freedom party, attacked nearby homes.
Street battles raged on for most of Saturday night, resulting in the death
of at least 30. A family of four, including a five-month-old baby, perished.
Tembisa residents, most of them supporters of the African National Congress,
said the attack was unprovoked.
The violence flared as the ANC and the government were making last-ditch
efforts to get Inkatha, the KwaZulu homeland and the pro-apartheid
Conservative party back to democracy talks.
The three groups, which seek virtual autonomy in a post-apartheid South
Africa, walked out of the talks three weeks ago, accusing the ANC and the
government of trying to push the country into an election before agreement
was reached on the future form of the state and violence had been curbed.
More than 530 have died since negotiators confirmed the April 27, 1994
election date.
