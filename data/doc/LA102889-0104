WORLD IN BRIEF; 
LEBANON; 
ANDERSON HAS 5TH BIRTHDAY AS HOSTAGE 
Journalist Terry A. Anderson spent a fifth birthday as a hostage, a grim 
milestone in his captivity in Lebanon. His relatives and friends marked the 
event with a flood of messages and a Mass in Washington. Radio reports said 
Lebanon's three television stations would screen a birthday message from his 
4-year-old daughter, Sulome, whom he has never held. Gunmen from the radical 
Islamic Jihad group seized the Associated Press correspondent, then 41, in 
Muslim West Beirut on March 16, 1985.
