FT  27 MAY 94 / Florida moves against smoking
Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida yesterday signed a law giving the US state
legal tools to sue tobacco companies for the costs of caring for Medicaid
patients stricken by smoking-related illnesses, AP reports from Tallahassee.
This week the state of Mississippi sued 13 cigarette manufacturers to have
them reimburse taxpayers for the cost of smoking-related illnesses.
'We're going to take the Marlboro man to court,' Mr Chiles said. 'With this
law, Florida sends a loud and clear message to the tobacco giants that they
will be held accountable for sponsoring sickness and death.'
