VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY; 
CORONER SAYS MAN COMMITTED SUICIDE 
The recent death of a Simi Valley man, first thought to have been a homicide, 
has been ruled a suicide, authorities say. 
The Ventura County coroner's office has determined that Christopher Fortunato, 
29, shot himself once in the head with a .22-caliber handgun in the early 
morning hours of March 5, Sgt. Tony Harper said Tuesday. 
Kari Fortunato, 31, was arrested the same day on suspicion of slaying her 
husband but was later released. 
Fortunato was found shot to death in the hallway of the couple's home in the 
1100 block of Hudson Court, police said. Officers were called to the home by a 
neighbor after the victim's wife ran to the neighbor's home to ask for help. 
Kari Fortunato, who was covered with blood, was taken to Simi Valley Adventist 
Hospital. She had been shot in the head and in both hands. Police believe the 
dead man quarreled with his wife, shot her and then shot himself. CARLOS LOZANO
