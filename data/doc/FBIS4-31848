<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Provocation By Skopje"] </F>
  [Text] The fair of Macedonian economic products in Albania, 
under the title of "Republic of Macedonia," opened on June 15 
and to last until June 18, caused bitter reactions by a part of 
the media in Tirana. The paper RILINDJA called on the 
authorities to change the title, claiming it imposes a name, 
non-existent in the international communication. The same 
paper, as MAKPRES reports, is a provocation by Skopje, similar 
to the one with the recent agreement on cooperation in 
agriculture, not signed exactly because of the name.
