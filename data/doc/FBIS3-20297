  [Text] Frankfurt/Main (DPA) -- The Central Council of Jews 
in Germany has demanded the "legal, political, and social 
ostracism" of right-wing extremists. The attack on the 
synagogue in Luebeck was an attack on "the substance of 
democracy," Presidium member Michel Friedman said in an 
interview with DPA in Frankfurt. The approximately 50,000 Jews 
in Germany are citizens of this country and "Jewish identity is 
part of the overall society." 
  "The intellectual originators and arsonists of 
anti-Semitism" 
are the right-wing extremist Republikaner with their chairman 
Franz Schoenhuber, who called Central Council Chairman Ignatz 
Bubis an "instigator of people." They want to turn the victims 
into perpetrators to divert attention from their own guilt, 
Friedman said, who is also a member of the committee of the 
Jewish Community in the city on the Main. 
  "There must not be any tolerance toward intolerance." The 
first victims are always the minorities, but in the end every 
citizen is in danger if the society does not defend itself 
against violence: "Violence is eating from the fringe toward the 
inside." Friedman criticized the silence and passiveness of 
many citizens: "Most people are not hostile toward people, but 
many are too indifferent."
