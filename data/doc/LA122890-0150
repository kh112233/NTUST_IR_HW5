GROWTH HORMONE LINKED TO AGING 
Research suggests that treatment with human growth hormone may reverse some of 
the effects that aging has on the body. 
Injecting a genetically engineered version of the natural body hormone led to 
an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in body fat in a group of men ranging 
in age from 61 to 81 years old. 
However, the results are preliminary, and the long-term effects of human growth 
hormone have yet to be determined. 
"What is exciting is the possibility of using growth hormone on a short-term 
basis to assist recovery from illness, injury and surgery in older people," 
said Dr. Jir-Shiong Tsai, a specialist in geriatric medicine at New York 
University Medical Center. 
"Having more muscle strength in these situations could be highly beneficial," 
Tsai observed. "We are conducting clinical trials to test this theory." 
"Everyone loses muscle and gains fat with age," he explained. A decline in 
human growth hormone may be one reason why fat gathers and muscles wither as 
people grow older. 
"At this point, people should not be calling their physicians to ask if they 
should be taking growth hormone," Tsai said. "But the future looks very 
promising." 
Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland during sleep. As it 
circulates through the body, it stimulates the production of a protein that 
spurs tissue growth and helps maintain organ health. 
Over time, at least one-third of the population stops producing any useful 
amount of the hormone, Tsai said. 
In the study, healthy older men found to be deficient in that protein were 
given injections of synthetic human growth hormone. After six months, the men 
had significantly increased muscle mass and skin thickness, and decreased 
accumulations of body fat.
