19TH-CENTURY SAVIOR OF MADAGASCAR'S CATHOLICS BEATIFIED BY VISITING POPE 
Pope John Paul II on Sunday beatified a 19th-Century woman who protected the 
Roman Catholic Church from persecution, lauding her as a model for women and 
lay people. 
The Pope, on the third day of his visit to this African island nation, 
beatified Victoire Rasoamanarivo in a three-hour service before a crowd 
estimated by local organizers at 500,000 -- about half the capital's 
population. 
Beatification is the first step toward possible sainthood. 
Rasoamanarivo, who died in 1894 at 46, is considered the savior of the Catholic 
Church in this nation of 11 million people, 22% of whom are Catholic. 
The granddaughter of a prime minister, she converted to the faith at 13, to the 
consternation of her pagan parents. 
When Catholic missionaries were expelled from Madagascar in 1883, she fought to 
keep Catholic schools open, traveled the countryside to encourage the faithful 
and appealed to the royal family to respect religious rights. 
When missionaries were allowed to return in 1886, they found the church still 
thriving. 
"Those few years of service left a reminder that is still very much alive," 
said the pontiff, speaking in French. "She is a model for the lay faithful 
today." 
The Pope cited her work with the poor, the sick and prisoners and held her up 
as an example for women in the church. 
He also hailed the "courageous fidelity Victoire showed the sacrament of 
marriage despite the problems of her marriage." 
Her husband, Radriaka, son of the prime minister, was a notorious drinker and 
womanizer. But before dying, after falling off a balcony in the 18th year of 
their marriage, he accepted his wife's plea to be baptized, church officials 
said. 
The Pope, on his fifth tour of Africa, leaves today for the French island of 
Reunion, then visits Zambia and Malawi.
