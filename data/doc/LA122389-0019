SELLING PIECES OF BERLIN WALL 
There must be something peculiar to our species that we have this preoccupation 
with rocks. When we're growing up, we collect them. When we stop growing, we 
erect them -- into walls. 
I've touched rocks and walls in Washington, D.C. One rock was polished smooth 
so that people couldn't break off a piece. It was from the moon. One wall was 
nothing but broken pieces -- its black surface scratched with the names of a 
few of my teen-age friends -- and 58,000 more. 
The Berlin Wall, now there was a wall! It divided people and ideologies for 
more than a quarter century. They got their money's worth when they built that 
eyesore. 
I never actually thought we'd ever see an end to the Berlin Wall, except from 
Soviet Bloc tanks blasting through. 
Instead, I bought a piece of that monument to subjugation, at a department 
store, at $10 a pop, just in time for Christmas. 
I know it's an artifact, and a piece of history, but every time I look at it I 
have to smile. There's just something about the thought of free enterprise 
selling the Wall for profit that smacks of poetic justice. 
Who says God doesn't have a sense of humor? Only those who don't know him and 
build walls.
