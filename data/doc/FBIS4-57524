  [Text] On the morning of 17 May, Televisa Coahuila 
correspondent Juan Andres Martinez reported on "The Awakening 
Program" hosted by Guillermo Ortega that judicial agents protect 
drug traffickers in the city of Saltillo. As a result of this 
report, Martinez was arrested. 
  At the office of Judicial Police Commander Mario Espinoza 
Lobato, Martinez was accused of committing a serious offense by 
tarnishing the image of the Attorney General's Office, PGR, with 
his report. The Televisa correspondent was arrested without an a 
warrant. He was held incommunicado for nearly nine hours and 
was transferred to the Saltillo Prison, where he remained until 
this afternoon. This occurred after he broadcast a report which 
the PGR station in Coahuila did not like. They are now saying 
that he committed other offenses. We find this very strange, 
however. We are asking that the abuses against correspondent 
Juan Andres Martinez be dealt with in accordance with the law.
