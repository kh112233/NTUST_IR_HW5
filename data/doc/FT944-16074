FT  14 OCT 94 / Swiss confirm cult leader dead
The Swiss authorities said yesterday that the 'guru' of the Order of the
Solar Temple, Luc Jouret, wanted for murder since the discovery of the
bodies of 53 followers in Switzerland and Canada last week, died with his
disciples. Investigating judge Jean-Pascal Jaquemet, heading the inquiry
into 25 deaths last week in the Alpine village of Granges-sur-Salvan, said
Jouret's body had been formally identified among the dead. The deaths of
Joseph Di Mambro, the dictatorial 'pope' of the order, and Camille Pilet,
the Swiss businessman who acted as the sect's treasurer, were confirmed by
police earlier this week. In recent days, speculation was rife that Jouret
had set up his fellow cult members and escaped with the sect's considerable
financial assets. Jouret was a Belgian-born 46-year-old homeopathic doctor
whose charisma made him the cult's chief recruiter. An international arrest
warrant for murder and arson was issued for him after the deaths were
discovered last Wednesday. Twenty-five cult members, including Jouret, died
in Granges and 23 others were found dead in the village of Cheiry, 160km to
the north. Five more corpses were found in a community north of the Canadian
city of Montreal.
