  [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- The Russian Foreign Ministry 
warned Japanese vessels against violating Russia's state border 
and announced its readiness to employ all legal means to prevent 
incidents like that. 
  Addressing today's briefing in Moscow, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Grigoriy Karasin reported that at 7:30 local time on 
March 30, five Japanese low-tonnage vessels had penetrated for 
5.9 kilometres into Russian territorial waters near the island 
of Anuchin. A patrol ship of the Japanese directorate for 
safety at sea was staying not far off. The captains of the 
Japanese vessels ignored orders to stop given from Russian 
patrol ships and a helicopter. After being chased, the Japanese 
vessels left Russian territorial waters at 9:55. 
  In this connection, the spokesman went on to say, it should 
be recalled that the Russian side has repeatedly drawn Tokyo's 
attention to such violations and pointed to their negative 
effect upon the general atmosphere of Russian-Japanese relations. 
  "Regarding such violations as inadmissible, we insist that 
the Japanese side take necessary measures to prevent them in 
future", Karasin stressed. Russian coast guards will use all 
rights they have under the Russian law "on state border" to 
prevent border violations, he warned.
