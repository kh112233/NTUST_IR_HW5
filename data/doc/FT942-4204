FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Chemicals vital for African
agriculture'
Africa will have to start using large amounts of chemical fertilisers if the
continent is ever to solve its own food problems, according to Mr Norman
Borlaug, a prominent agriculturalist, who won the Nobel Peace prize in 1970
for engineering India's 'green' revolution.
Mr Borlaug told a meeting at the Overseas Development Institute yesterday:
'Some people say that Africa's food problems can be solved without the
application of chemical fertilisers. They're dreaming. It's not possible'.
He said that the environmentalists advocating traditional farming methods
failed to recognise the rapid growth in population expected in the
continent. The population of sub-Saharan Africa was set to double in the
next 22 years, he claimed, which would put a considerable strain on
non-chemical farming.
China had managed to transform its production of cereals in the five years
between 1975 and 1980, increasing yields by a tonne a hectare by using
chemical fertilisers, Mr Borlaug said. China's output of cereals had risen
from 238m tonnes to 285m tonnes during that period even though farmers had
already been using organic compost on the land.
Today China produced the most cereals in the world with average yields of 4
tonnes per hectare, Mr Borlaug said.
Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest use of fertiliser in the world and soil
nutrients were so low that other efforts to raise crop productivity would
not be successful until fertility was improved.
Mr Borlaug said, however, that it was extremely expensive for African
countries to import fertiliser, and he called on industrialised nations to
provide the continent's farmers with access to adequate inputs.
