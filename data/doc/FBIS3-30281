  [Excerpt] Zagreb, Jan 29 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] commander strongly protested to the head of Bosnian 
Croat forces Saturday after three Italian journalists were 
killed in Mostar and two peacekeepers wounded in central Bosnia, 
UNPROFOR said. 
  The Italian television journalists were among 10 people 
killed Friday during Croat shelling of the Moslem part of 
Mostar, a divided town in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The peacekeepers were wounded when Croat forces (HVO) 
attacked a UN convoy taking fuel to a hospital in the central 
town of Bakovici on Thursday. 
  In a letter to General Ante Roso, HVO chief-of-staff, the 
UN's General Jean Cot condemned "this type of behaviour" as 
"totally inadmissable," UNPROFOR said in a statement. 
  In a separate incident, two UN military observers -- a 
Dutchman and a Bangladeshi -- were slightly wounded Friday when 
a mine exploded near Drnis, in southern Croatia, UNPROFOR said. 
  They were driving with a third observer in the "southern 
sector," one of four areas of Croatia under UN protection, when 
they went over the mine. 
  The wounded men, who had wounds in the head, were 
hospitalized in Split, southern Croatia. [passage omitted]
