SCORPIO SEDANS RECALLED TO REPLACE THROTTLE SENSOR 
Ford Motor Co. announced Thursday that it is recalling about 18,000 1988 and 
1989 Scorpio luxury sedans with 2.9-liter engines to replace a throttle 
position sensor. A spokesman said a bad sensor could cause the engine idle to 
be high or rough in neutral or park, or could cause the motor to stumble when 
placed in gear.
