AIDE URGES FDA TO MAKE MAJOR FOOD LABEL CHANGES 
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said Friday that he asked 
the Food and Drug Administration to consider major changes in government food 
labeling standards. 
The FDA is expected to propose a federal rule on the various aspects of food 
labeling early next year. The agency has long required labeling listing 
ingredients, net weight and nutritional information on foods. 
Sullivan said there is no comprehensive, mandatory food labeling requirement 
for nutritional labeling for all foods, despite the government's efforts to 
improve food labeling.
