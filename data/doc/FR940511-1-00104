 

These proposed changes in the Federal leave system were recommended in the Report of the National Performance Review
on September 7, 1993, and are part of OPM's continuing effort to develop human resource policies that are sensitive
to the needs of employees and thereby enhance the Federal Government's ability to recruit and retain a well-qualified
workforce. The purpose of the proposed changes in the circumstances under which employees may use sick leave is to
recognize the needs of Federal employees who struggle to maintain an often precarious balance between work and family
and to assist the Federal Government in recruiting and retaining the employees it needs to accomplish its mission.
We have also proposed additional changes in 630.401 to clarify our intent with regard to situations involving
exposure to a severe contagious/communicable disease. We describe a severe communicable disease as one that requires
isolation for a specified period, as prescribed by the health authorities having jurisdiction or as determined by
a health care provider.


Because of the similarity of purpose, OPM proposes to use the same definitions of ``child,'' ``spouse,'' and ``parent''
as those used for ``son or daughter,'' ``spouse,'' and ``parent'' in the interim regulations implementing the Family
and Medical Leave Act of 1993. (See 5 CFR 630.1202.)


The change in rules on the recredit of sick leave would ensure that, in the future, employees who have conscientiously
maintained a substantial sick leave balance could leave Federal employment for any purpose (including the need to
care for a child, spouse, or parent) without the risk of forfeiting all accrued sick leave upon returning to Federal
employment thereafter. We believe this change would help to foster the conscientious use of sick leave by all employees.


Finally, the proposed regulations also include conforming changes in 630.402 (Application for sick leave),
630.403 (Supporting evidence), and 630.405 (Use of sick leave during annual leave).
