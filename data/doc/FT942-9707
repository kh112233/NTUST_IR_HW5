FT  14 MAY 94 / Rwanda rebel offensive halted
The rebel offensive in Rwanda appeared to have stalled yesterday, despite
heavy fighting in the countryside and new reports of ethnic massacres. UN
officials said 88 students were found hacked to death on Thursday at a
school in Gikongoro in south-west Rwanda, and seven people were killed with
machetes in front of the Red Cross building in Kigali.
The fighting between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis in Rwanda has
already claimed 100,000 to 200,000 lives in little more than a month, the UN
and aid groups say. Most of the victims have been civilians. The UN Security
Council plans to send up to 5,500 African troops to Rwanda to establish safe
havens for civilians and assist relief workers. But it was unclear whether
the troops would be allowed to use force, how they would be financed and
whether an arms embargo would be imposed on the warring parties.
