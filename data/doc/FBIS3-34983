  [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Meetings of the 
Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint Committee began at the 
Jordanian Foreign Ministry yesterday, five days after the 
meeting held between King Husayn of Jordan and Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat in Amman following the signing of the 
Cairo agreement between the PLO and Israel. 
  Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, arrived 
in Amman the day before yesterday evening at the head of a large 
official delegation to attend the joint committee's meetings. 
  Qaddumi told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday: The meetings 
between the Jordanian and Palestinian sides are the most 
important central link in our current political moves because 
they are linked to crucial issues. 
  He added: As for the complete agreement with Jordan, as far 
as I am concerned, it is more important than the Cairo agreement 
signed with Israel. Because progress in bilateral agreements 
with the brothers will produce other agreements until we reach a 
formula for organizing future relations in all spheres. 
  Qaddumi said: The meetings will deal with the agreements 
issue, the political agreement, and details of the economic 
agreement we signed in Amman last month, which includes banks, 
trade, workers, customs, individuals' movement, crossing points, 
and borders. Another committee, namely the Emigrants and 
Refugees Committee, will also convene. As is well known, it is 
a sensitive and important committee for the Jordanian brothers, 
and we will provide information and figures. 
  He stressed that with regard to the numbers and categories 
of 
emigrants and refugees, we will draw up a joint view in this 
connection in preparation for a tripartite meeting with Egypt 
and then a quadripartite meeting which will include Israel as 
well. [passage omitted]
