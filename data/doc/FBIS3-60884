  [Text] The Federal Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution [BfV] is sounding the alarm: Foreign terrorists 
are carrying out attacks in Germany with increasing frequency -- 
as a protest against oppression in their homelands. The BfV 
says in a confidential report: German targets are "increasingly 
aimed at by foreign groups that are ready to use violence." 
  Terrorists from abroad: The BfV is warning against the 
following groups: 
  -- Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK (banned since November): 
It has "repeatedly voiced threats against the Federal 
Government" and receives "support from the German left-wing 
extremist scene." 
  -- Lebanese Hizballah (Party of God): It was reportedly 
involved in the assassination of four Kurdish functionaries in 
Berlin. 
  -- Islamic extremists: They are supported by, for example, 
Iran and Libya. They persecute and kill critics and opposition 
members. Says the BfV report: "The constitutional protection 
authorities have repeatedly managed to prevent attempts to 
assassinate opposition members." 
  -- Indian Sikhs: They are fighting for their own state in 
the Indian Punjab. Sikhs who live in our country have 
reportedly carried out an attack on the Indian ambassador in 
Romania. 
  -- Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE): Terrorists from 
Sri Lanka are reportedly extorting donations from their 
compatriots in Germany. Twenty investigations are underway. 
  -- Serbian and Croatian groups: According to the BfV, 
clashes between extremist members of these two ethnic groups are 
becoming more and more frequent.
