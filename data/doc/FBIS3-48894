  [Text] The daily MERDEKA highlights the dispute over the 
islands of Sipadan and Ligitan. The daily understands 
Malaysia's apprehension if the International Court of Justice 
confirms Indonesian ownership of the two disputed islands 
because the sea lanes from Tawau to Malaysia's Exclusive 
Economic Zone situated in the Sulawesi Straits will be under 
Indonesian control. However, MERDEKA hopes that Malaysia will 
discard such a narrow-minded perception and will instead adopt a 
far-sighted attitude. 
  The daily reiterates that Indonesia has no intention 
whatsoever of putting Malaysia in a disadvantageous position. 
It recalls that Southeast Asia was once a kingdom alternatively 
ruled by sovereign rulers in the southern part of the Malay 
archipelago and in the Malay Peninsula. It adds: Why can't the 
fact that Singapore -- the majority of whose population is not 
of Malay stock -- is able to cooperate with Indonesia in 
developing the Riau islands serve as an example for Indonesia 
and Malaysia -- whose peoples have the same forefathers -to have 
good relations?
