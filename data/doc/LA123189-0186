TERM LIMITS FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS 
You say (without explaining the connection) that term limits "would upset the 
balance of power between elected officials, who often require years of service 
to command the details of policy questions." But such limits would, on the 
contrary, allow more fairness in elections. Any pol who can't give up 
fund-raising long enough to learn such details in two terms should be replaced 
by someone smarter and more dedicated. 
Most disturbing, you say, is that term limits "would constitute a collective 
admission that our government and our politics have failed." On the contrary, 
both would be improved, because many more people would vote and the quality of 
politics would thereby improve. Our present disgracefully low voter turnout is 
directly due to a feeling of helplessness in any effort to displace incumbents, 
no matter how incompetent. And finally, your professed faith in the people's 
ability to recognize official corruption and turn the rascals out via vote or 
recall in timely fashion is, unfortunately, pitiful.
