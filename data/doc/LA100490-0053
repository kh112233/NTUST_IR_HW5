VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD; 
TRAIN HITS CAR BUT MEN ESCAPE UNHURT 
An Oxnard man who was towing a friend's pickup narrowly missed serious injury 
when his car was hit by an Amtrak train, police officials said. 
Frank Eugene McAdams had stopped Tuesday night for the railroad warning lights 
at 5th Street and Rice Road when he realized he had pulled too close to the 
tracks, Oxnard Police Sgt. Gene Thayer said. 
"He pulled forward a bit and the crossing arm came down on the chain between 
his car and the one he was towing. Everyone jumped out of their cars and ran, 
and the train struck the car on the tracks," Thayer said. 
McAdams and his friend were not hurt in the 7:05 p.m. incident. KAREN MCKEAN
