  [Text] The Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] 
revealed today the arrest of Yi Pok-hon, 32, who, following 
orders from North Korea, had conspired with an international 
criminal group to remove [chego] figures engaged in anti-North 
activities abroad after he received terrorist training in North 
Korea. The NSP requested an arrest warrant for him on a charge 
of violation of the National Security Law [NSL]. 
  When he was placed on the wanted list on charges of fraud in 
1990, Yi went to Malaysia and joined the international criminal 
group Asia Sharon, which is involved in drug smuggling and 
contract violation. He is under suspicion of visiting North 
Korea six times. 
  The NSP reported that during his visit to North Korea, Yi 
was 
warmly received by Kim Chong-il and received an order from (Choe 
Sung-kap), a leading member of the Committee for the Peaceful 
Reunification of the Fatherland, to remove Pak Kap-tong and Yi 
Sang-cho, who are carrying out anti-North activities, by winning 
over the head of a South Korean gangster organization. 
According to the North Korean order, he was engaged in 
conspiracy [amyak]. 
  The NSP also reported that Yi arranged the sale of North 
Korean weapons to 50 Asia Sharon members in June 1993 to assist 
them in special military training [tuksu kunsa hullyon] in North 
Korea. Thus, he served as a channel between the international 
criminal group and North Korea.
