SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background


In the 

Federal Register

 of January 23, 1985 (50 FR 3082), FDA announced its intention to revoke product licenses (hereinafter referred to
as the 1985 proposal), or the authorization of manufacturers to produce individual products under their licenses
for the manufacture of allergenic extracts, for any allergenic extract classified into Category IIIB. The proposed
action was based on the conclusions and recommendations of the Panel on Review of Allergenic Extracts (the Panel),
including the Panel's conclusions that data were insufficient to classify certain products as safe and effective
and that the products have an unfavorable benefit-to-risk potential. The conclusions and recommendations of the
Panel are contained in a report to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs which was reprinted in the 1985 proposal. Those
products with insufficient data and an unfavorable benefit-to-risk potential, which the Panel believed should
not continue to be marketed during the development of data to resolve whatever safety and effectiveness questions
exist, were classified in Category IIIB.
FDA also announced in the 1985 proposal that the Panel recommended that two products be classified into Category II
(unsafe, ineffective, or misbranded). However, the license for one of the products was revoked at the request of the
manufacturer during the Panel's review. The other product had been classified as Category II for a specific indication
for immunotherapy that had not previously been approved by FDA, and the agency is not aware of such immunotherapeutic
use of the product. Therefore, no action was proposed on the two products.
Many allergenic extracts were classified by the Panel in Category IIIA, designating products for which the available
data are insufficient to determine whether the product license should be revoked or affirmed and which may be marketed
pending the completion of further testing. Under 601.26 (21 CFR 601.26), all biological products recommended
for Category IIIA are to be reclassified into Category I or Category II. The Panel established to reclassify Category
IIIA allergenic extracts has completed its review and submitted its recommendations to FDA. The agency will announce
its proposed response to the recommendations for reclassification of Category IIIA allergenic extracts in a future
issue of the 

Federal Register

.
In the 

Federal Register

 of August 9, 1985 (50 FR 32314), FDA published a notice of opportunity for hearing (hereinafter referred to as the 1985
notice), concerning specified allergenic extracts that the agency had proposed for inclusion in Category IIIB in
the 1985 proposal. Approximately 280 of the 1,600 generic allergens representing almost 6,000 individual company
allergenic extracts reviewed by the Panel had been classified into Category IIIB. The 1985 notice included a listing
of all licensed manufacturers and the products classified as Category IIIB.


A. Requests for Hearings


In response to the 1985 notice, FDA received four requests for hearings from licensed manufacturers of allergenic
extracts. The following manufacturers submitted requests:
1. Antigen Laboratories, Inc., 3034 South Main, P.O. Box 123, Liberty, MO 64068, submitted a request for hearing
dated August 30, 1985, on several unspecified products placed into Category IIIB for diagnostic use. In a subsequent
letter dated March 22, 1988, Antigen Laboratories, Inc., withdrew its hearing request.
2. Barry Laboratories, Inc., P.O. Box 1967, Pompano Beach, FL 33061, submitted a request for hearing dated December
11, 1985, on its Poison Ivy-Oak-Sumac Extracts, combined, injection in almond oil (Rhus-All Antigen

TM

), License No. 119. At the manufacturer's request, the establishment and product licenses issued to Barry Laboratories,
Inc., were revoked on January 19, 1988. The pending request for hearing would have determined whether the product
and establishment licenses issued to Barry Laboratories, Inc., should be revoked. The request for license revocation
constitutes a withdrawal of the request for a hearing, and consideration of the data is unnecessary.
3. Mulford Colloid Laboratories, Division of Lemmon Co., Inc., Cathill and Lonely Rds., Sellersville, PA 18960,
submitted a request for hearing dated September 5, 1985, on the Category IIIB classification of its Poison Ivy Extract,
injection in hydro-alcoholic solution (Rhustox Antigen

TM

), License No. 102. At the manufacturer's request, the establishment and product licenses issued to Mulford Colloid
Laboratories, Division of Lemmon Co., Inc., were revoked on January 28, 1992. The pending request for hearing would
have determined whether the product and establishment licenses issued to Mulford Colloid Laboratories, Division
of Lemmon Co., Inc., should be revoked. The request for license revocation constitutes a withdrawal of the request
for a hearing, and consideration of the data is unnecessary.
4. Parke-Davis, Division of Warner-Lambert Co., 201 Tabor Rd., Morris Plains, NJ 07950, submitted a request for hearing
dated September 6, 1985, on the Category IIIB classification of its Poison Ivy Extract, injection in almond oil, License
No. 1. Parke-Davis submitted data to support its request for hearing on its injectable Poison Ivy Extract. FDA is reviewing
the data submitted and has not yet reached a decision on the request for hearing. Therefore, under 21 CFR 12.38(b),
FDA will issue a separate notice regarding the hearing request on the injectable Poison Ivy Extract produced by Parke-Davis,
Division of Warner-Lambert Co. The effective date of this notice does not apply to this product.


B. Comments


The 1985 notice also requested comments regarding the 1985 proposal to revoke product licenses for all allergenic
extracts classified into Category IIIB. FDA received approximately 1,700 comments in response to the 1985 notice.
All of the comments received concerning the Category IIIB classifications were evaluated by FDA in developing the
agency's conclusions set forth in this order and notice. Summaries of the comments and the agency's responses follow:
1. The majority of comments concerning the classification of products into Category IIIB were testimonial in nature,
most of them form letters submitted by physicians and their patients. Most of the comments expressed concern that
some of the Category IIIB products would no longer be available for medical use. No new and relevant data that had not
been previously available to the Panel or FDA were submitted by the comments. A summary of these general comments related
to Category IIIB classifications follows:
a. Several comments supported the Category IIIB classification of winged whole body hymenoptera insect extracts;
several comments opposed the classification of these products. Data were submitted in support of the Category IIIB
classification of these whole body extracts and in support of the use of pure venom extracts rather than whole body
extracts for the diagnosis and treatment of insect sting allergy.
b. Over 1,000 of the comments, a majority of which were form letters, opposed the Category IIIB classification of food
extracts. Some of the comments made reference to specific food extracts, including food extracts not proposed for
classification in Category IIIB, and other comments referred to food extracts in general.
The 1985 proposal discussed the Panel report, which stated that extracts of manufactured foods or undefined source
materials which are mixtures or whose composition may vary from time-to-time should be discontinued (50 FR 3082 at
3247). The comments did not appear to recognize that native, single food extracts were not classified in Category
IIIB and will remain on the market until reclassification procedures are completed. All Category IIIB food extracts
are derived from processed foods or mixtures. Examples of processed foods or mixtures are those that are canned or
contain added chemicals or preservatives.
Five of the comments opposing the Category IIIB classification of food extracts referred to information in published
journal articles. None of the articles contained data or information demonstrating that any food extract classified
in Category IIIB is safe and effective for the uses described in the products' labeling. The journal articles failed
to cite data with satisfactory controls, did not identify the manufacturers of the food extracts, or used allergenic
products in the studies that were not Category IIIB products.
c. Many of the same comments that opposed the Category IIIB classification of food extracts also opposed the Category
IIIB classification of trichophyton, oidiomycin, and epidermophyton (T.O.E.)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 molds involved in dermatomycosis. A small number of the comments opposed the Category IIIB classification of certain
extracts of animal epidermals, plant oleoresins, insects other than winged whole body hymenoptera insects, and
miscellaneous inhalants. Several of the comments referred to specific products that were not classified in Category
IIIB and were not subject to the 1985 notice.


<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
1

</FOOTNAME>
T.O.E. is a mixture of various species of the three genera of dermatophytes: Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum.
</FOOTNOTE>


Until data from further studies are developed to resolve questions of safety and effectiveness, FDA cannot agree
with the comments opposing the final classification of Category IIIB allergenic extracts. The Panel, with public
participation, carefully reviewed the available data on these products. The Panel concluded that further testing
was required and that because of questionable benefit and/or potential risk, these products should be removed from
the market until the questions concerning their safety and effectiveness were resolved. The comments submitted
no additional data to resolve the remaining questions. Applicable provisions of the Public Health Service Act and
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations require that biological drug products be demonstrated
to be safe and effective through adequate studies and that such products not be misbranded. In the absence of adequate
data, FDA cannot determine, based on testimonials alone, that the statutory requirements have been met.
2. One comment questioned whether sheep wool extract that is prepared from unprocessed sheep shearings, rather than
from processed wool, should be classified as Category IIIB. Manufacturers of sheep wool extract did not provide any
data on the safety and effectiveness of their products for diagnostic or therapeutic use. FDA is not aware of any data
to support distinguishing the safety and effectiveness of extracts prepared from processed sheep wool from the extracts
prepared from freshly clipped sheep shearings. The 1985 proposal discussed suggestions by the Panel that unprocessed
source materials from sheep be investigated (50 FR 3082 at 3179). Until appropriate studies are performed to establish
the safety and effectiveness of these extracts, all sheep wool and other sheep epidermal extracts are classified
as Category IIIB.
3. Washington Homeopathic Pharmacy, Inc., submitted a comment to the 1985 notice, asking FDA to permit the firm to
market its preparation of Poison Ivy Extract, License No. 392, (Homeopathic Rhus Tox. 3X Pills) as a homeopathic preparation
and not as a licensed biological product. Subsequently, at the manufacturer's request, the establishment and product
licenses were revoked on August 5, 1994.
The Panel recommended placing this product in Category IIIB because there was no evidence of effectiveness of the
product for either prophylactic treatment or treatment of active contact dermatitis. However, the Panel stated
that FDA may wish to consider this product differently because it is a homeopathic remedy that is highly diluted in
accordance with homeopathic principles (50 FR 3082 at 3271).
In the 1985 proposal the agency recognized the Panel's suggestion that FDA may wish to consider this homeopathic product
differently. FDA responded by proposing that ``*** this biological product should be subject to
the same regulatory procedures as other Category IIIB biologicals'' (50 FR 3082 at 3282). The 1985 proposal stated
``* * * The regulations in 601.25 (21 CFR 601.25) make no separate provision for standards of effectiveness
for homeopathic drugs'' (50 FR 3082 at 3271). Because FDA has reviewed the data concerning the safety and efficacy
of Poison Ivy Extract, manufactured by Washington Homeopathic Pharmacy, Inc., License No. 392, and determined that
there was no evidence of effectiveness for either prophylactic treatment or treatment of active contact dermatitis,
FDA is denying the manufacturer's request to permit the firm to market its Poison Ivy Extract, License No. 392, as an
over-the-counter (OTC) homeopathic preparation. 
4. Several comments expressed the view that some Panel members were biased regarding their recommendations for Category
IIIB classification of certain extracts and that the Panel did not represent a wide divergence of responsible medical
and scientific opinion from various medical groups or societies.
FDA disagrees with these comments. The Panel members were selected on the basis of their qualifications to review
allergenic extracts to determine if they are safe, effective, and not misbranded for their labeled uses. The members
were not selected as representatives of various medical societies. The members have had experience with allergenic
extracts and are exceptionally well qualified in the fields of allergy, immunology, pediatrics, and the proper methodology
for conducting scientific investigations. Most of the members are physicians who were engaged in active medical
practice during their Panel membership. FDA believes that the expertise of the Panel members qualified them to review
the safety and effectiveness data related to all allergenic extracts. FDA finds no reason to believe that the members
did not represent an appropriate divergence of responsible viewpoints.
5. A number of comments acknowledged the need for additional studies to be performed on certain Category IIIB products.
Several of the comments stated that certain food extract products are effective when used with techniques that are
not indicated in the approved labeling of the products.
Additional studies need to be performed on any allergenic extract classified as Category IIIB. The Panel reviewed
allergenic extracts to determine whether the licensed products are safe and effective for their labeled uses. There
are allergenic extracts currently approved by FDA for use in the diagnosis and immunotherapy of immunoglobulin E-mediated
(IgE-mediated) allergy to the respective ingested food. The Panel was not charged with reviewing food extracts for
uses not contained in the approved product labeling. Nevertheless, the Panel considered the use of food extracts
in both IgE and non-IgE-mediated allergy. Food extracts were discussed at 16 of the 32 Panel meetings and all persons
who requested an opportunity to appear were given time to appear before the Panel. Although the non-IgE-mediated
uses discussed in the comments were contained in the approved product labeling, the lack of available data on such
uses justifies the Category IIIB classification of those food extracts of processed foods or extract mixtures prepared
from undefined and variable source materials. If studies are conducted to determine the safety and effectiveness
of an allergenic extract for uses not indicated in the current labeling, the data accumulated from the studies as well
as revised labeling and other necessary information should be submitted in the license application. Guidance on
study design may be found in the recommendations of the Panel, as discussed in the 1985 proposal concerning further
testing (50 FR 3082 at 3116 to 3123), and FDA's ``Draft Guideline for the Design of Clinical Trials for Evaluation of
the Safety and Efficacy of Allergenic Products for Therapeutic Uses'' (53 FR 48727, December 2, 1988). Any person
who is considering performing further studies may wish to consult with the agency concerning requirements.
6. One comment asked FDA to use the same standards for reviewing Category IIIB products that reclassification panels
used to reclassify Category IIIA products, including establishing a new panel to review them, if necessary.
The issue raised by this comment was addressed in the final rule establishing the reclassification procedures under
601.26, which was published in the 

Federal Register

 of October 5, 1982 (47 FR 44062 at 44065). The agency's position has not changed since publication of that final rule.
Products placed in Category IIIB differ from products that had been placed in Category IIIA in that the Category IIIB
designation represents a finding that the potential risks of marketing a product outweigh the potential benefits
and, therefore, the Category IIIB products should not be marketed pending the completion of additional studies.
However, interested persons may at any time submit to the agency for evaluation evidence that would be appropriate
to support the relicensing of a Category IIIB product.


C. Manufacturers and Products Affected


The 1985 notice included a listing of the Category IIIB products, most of which were classified by allergen, rather
than by manufacturer generically. Where the extract is licensed to a particular manufacturer under a specific product
license or the specific manufacturer's product was reviewed by the Panel, the listing includes the name of the manufacturer
along with that specific extract. The other Category IIIB classifications for products listed generically represent
Category IIIB classifications for the corresponding specific company products of each licensed manufacturer of
allergenic extracts. Some products were listed generically in Category IIIB for therapy and in a different category
(Category I or Category IIIA) for diagnosis. Other products are manufactured and approved only for immunotherapy.
Some of the companies produce only a few Category IIIB extracts or none at all. A company is subject to this notice only
to the extent that the company produces a product or products classified in Category IIIB. The currently licensed
manufacturers of allergenic extracts are again being listed below, for informational purposes only:

D. Category IIIB Alum Precipitated Extracts


In addition, alum precipitated allergenic extracts (Center-Al

TM

), licensed for use in immunotherapy only, to Center Laboratories, Division, EM Industries, Inc., Hawthorne, NY
11050, are placed in Category IIIB whenever the corresponding aqueous products are classified as Category IIIB.
Alum precipitated allergenic extracts, (Allpyral

TM

) licensed to Miles Inc., are placed in Category IIIB if the corresponding aqueous products are classified as Category
IIIB. The only exception to this statement is that Alum-precipitated Allpyral short ragweed pollen extract is classified
as Category IIIB because the Allpyral short required pollen extracts have been studied most extensively and information
suggests that this product is not effective even though the corresponding aqueous extract is currently classified
in Category IIIA.


E. Extracts Recommended for Category IIIB by the Panel, but Placed in Category IIIA by FDA, Subject to Reclassification


The Panel recommended that extracts of Cockroach, American; Cockroach, German; and Cockroach, Oriental be placed
into Category IIIB for immunotherapy and Category I for diagnosis. However, after the Panel completed its review,
new relevant data were published that justify reconsideration of the generic classification of these products.
A copy of these published data has been placed on file with the Dockets Management Branch (HFA305), Food and
Drug Administration, rm. 123, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. The Panel on Review of Allergenic Extracts
(Reclassification Panel) recommended that Cockroach, American; Cockroach, German and Cockroach, Oriental extracts
be placed in Category I for immunotherapy. Accordingly, licenses for Cockroach, American; Cockroach, German; Cockroach,
Oriental; and mixtures consisting of such extracts are not at this time being revoked pending reclassification into
either Category I or Category II.
In addition, the Panel recommended that extracts of beechnut (Fagus sylvatica), coffee (Coffea arabica), licorice
(Glycyrrhiza glabra), and butterfly be placed into Category IIIB for both diagnosis and therapy. However, the data
relating to these products were rereviewed by the Reclassification Panel, which has recommended reclassification
of these products into Category I for diagnostic use. Therefore, FDA believes that the licenses for these products
for diagnostic use should not be revoked at this time, pending review by the agency of the final report of the advisory
committee containing the recommendations for reclassification.


II. Findings


Based on the Panel's report and recommendations published in the 1985 proposal, and the agency's review of comments
received regarding the 1985 proposal and affected products, the product licenses for Category IIIB allergenic extracts
affected by this notice and the authorization of manufacturers to produce the specific products under a general product
license for allergenic extracts are revoked. Except for the outstanding request for a hearing from Parke-Davis,
Division of Warner-Lambert Co., Inc., concerning its injectable Poison Ivy Extract, injection in almond oil, and
the pending reclassification of specific cockroach extracts and extracts of beechnut, coffee, licorice, and butterfly
for diagnostic use, the revocation of licenses for the Category IIIB products listed or discussed above represents
the agency's final action on those allergenic extracts recommended by the Panel for classification into Category
IIIB. Any allergenic extract placed into Category IIIB and subject to this notice may not be lawfully marketed for
its Category IIIB indication(s) (diagnosis and/or therapy). However, if a product is approved for diagnosis but
classified into Category IIIB for therapy, a manufacturer may continue to produce and market that product for diagnostic
use if the labeling for the product is amended to reflect only the approved diagnostic use of the product. Specifically,
the container and package labels and the ``Indications and Usage'' section of the package insert must state prominently,
``FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY.'' This statement should immediately follow the proper name ``Allergenic Extract'' or
``Allergenic Extract Alum Precipitate,'' in the same size and type of print as the proper name. The ``Indications
and Usage'' section of the package insert must also include a statement that the product has not been shown by adequate
data to be safe and effective for therapeutic use. These labeling requirements will be reconsidered by FDA if a manufacturer
presents acceptable evidence obtained from future studies demonstrating that such labeling is no longer appropriate.
Labeling amendments for such products were required to be submitted to and approved by the Director, Office of Biologics
Research and Review (HFN825), Center for Drugs and Biologics, by February 5, 1986. Under an organizational
change separating the Center for Drugs and Biologics, labeling amendments are now submitted to the Director, Center
for Biologics Evaluation and Research (HFM481), 1401 Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville, MD 208521448.
The authorization for a manufacturer to produce a product for which the labeling is not changed will be revoked upon
the effective date of this order. Any biological product marketed without an approved license is subject to regulatory
action.
FDA notes that the lists of allergens in the published documents related to the Panel's recommendations may not include
all marketed specific products, partially because of the various systems of classifications that have been used.
For example, because of the large number of pollen extracts available (at least 777 different pollen extracts are
listed in manufacturers' catalogs), those extracts were reviewed by the Panel according to the botanical family
of the plant producing the pollen. The list of products in the 1985 proposal did not include each specific pollen extract
marketed. Consistent with the Panel's own review, FDA will consider the data and information that are available for
any product not included in the Panel's list of products in determining the classification of such a product. Any manufacturer
that is uncertain whether one of its products is included in the Category IIIB classification should request a decision
on the product's status from FDA. The request should be submitted in writing to the Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research (address above).
Except for an outstanding request for a hearing from Parke-Davis, Division of Warner-Lambert Co., Inc., concerning
its injectable Poison Ivy Extract, injection in almond oil, and the pending reclassification of specific cockroach
extracts and extracts of beechnut, coffee, licorice, and butterfly for diagnostic use, the revocation of licenses
for the Category IIIB products listed or discussed above represents the agency's final action on those allergenic
extracts recommended by the Panel for classification into Category IIIB. FDA advises that any allergenic extracts
placed into Category IIIB shall not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for its
IIIB indications on or after (

insert date 30 days after date of publication in the 

Federal Register

).
