PASSENGER SUFFERS BROKEN NECK IN TRAIN ACCIDENT 
A lakeside tram plunged out of control 120 feet down a hillside, hurling four 
passengers into the Lake of the Ozarks and breaking the neck of one of them, 
authorities said. 
Two of the other three were hospitalized in stable condition Monday, while the 
third was treated and released. The cause of the Sunday accident was still 
under investigation.
