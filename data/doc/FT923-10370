FT  31 JUL 92 / Russia cracks the whip over rouble zone: Moscow tells
republics of former Soviet Union they must decide soon whether to stay in or
get out
RUSSIA is getting tough with the other former republics of the Soviet Union.
It is telling them they must make a choice - stay in or get out of the
rouble zone.
Nearly all the central banks of the former Soviet republics continue to use
the rouble which the Russian central bank prints, but they do not submit to
any effective discipline over rouble denominated credits, thus creating a
serious source of monetary instability.
The central bank of Ukraine, for instance, issued credits of some Rbs500bn
last month to relieve the debt burden of the country's corporations. The
effect of such transactions is to debauch the Russian currency. The Ukraine
and the Baltic republics have even taken to printing their own bank notes,
faced with the inability of the Russian mint to produce enough roubles to
cope with hyper-inflation throughout the former Soviet Union.
Russia has been reluctant to tighten discipline because an end to the credit
extended to other republics means they will not be able to pay the bills
they owe to Russian enterprises, and could result in political instability
spilling over to Russia or affecting the Russians in those republics. But it
must save its own currency, so, this month and next it will put pressure on
them to choose. If they opt out, then they must negotiate conditions for
establishing a separate currency. If they decide to stay in, they must obey
the dictates of the Russian central bank.
A survey of the republics reveal that the majority will fall into line with
Russia. This is especially so in the case of Belarus, which signed an
agreement with Russia earlier this month hailed on both sides as heralding a
new era of co-operation and explicitly providing for submission of the
Belarus central bank to Russia's.
It is also broadly the case in central Asia, where none of the five
republics - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan or Uzbekistan -
is planning its own currency in the near future. Mr Bisenchaly Tadjiyakov,
deputy governor of the Kazakh bank, says that 'if we are forced to leave, we
will be the last to do so'. Mr Nazar Shaparov, president of the Turkmen
state bank, says: 'We plan to stay in for some time.'
None of this means forever, nor that they are happy. When Mr Alexander
Shokhin, Russia's deputy premier, toured central Asia last week to discuss
the rouble zone, he found that his hosts expected their meagre supply of
roubles to increase by next month at the latest. Mr Shikmatulla Yunusov, the
central bank chairman in Uzbekistan, says coupons will be introduced to make
up for the rouble deficiency, which has meant no pay for many Uzbeks for
some months.
'Our people are patient,' he says, hopefully. They will have to be. Mr
Georgy Khizha, another Russian deputy premier, said recently the Russian
central bank could not possibly make good the rouble deficit by August.
Of the three Caucasian states, only Azerbaijan says it will introduce its
own currency, the manat, supposedly from August 15, under a decree signed
last week by President Abulfaz Elchibey (though it is unclear how far it
will be a coupon, how far a genuinely separate currency). However, Aermenia
has no plans for a new currency yet, says Mr Ashot Salmazaryan, head of the
Finance Ministry's monetary department, and would only bring one in if the
cash shortage grew critical.
More surprisingly, Georgia, which is not a member of the Commonwealth of
Independent is will also not rushing to introduce its own currency. Mr
Nuzgar Shegeladze, vice-president of the state bank, said a commission had
been set up to study the issue, but he noted that the IMF and the World Bank
had both advised against.
For the three Baltic states, however, independence includes the currency,
too. Estonia already has the kroon, the first real separate currency, having
negotiated an exit from the rouble zone with the Russians last month. Latvia
last week introduced the rublis, which presently trades against the dollar
at a rate a little lower than the Russian rouble. Only Lithuania is
uncertain. Its former prime minister, Mr Gediminas Vagnorius, said that the
lit would be introduced from August 1, but his government fell last week.
Moldova, racked with military concerns and with government turbulence until
the recent partial ceasefire, has not carried out a decision made last
January to introduce the lei as a national currency (the lei is also the
name of the Romanian currency) and is not expected to do so soon.
This leaves Ukraine. Officially, the hryvnia is to be introduced in August
or September, a strategy confirmed by President Leonid Kravchuk in Paris
last month. Mr Alexander Yemelyanov, the chief economic adviser, says the
quicker Ukraine gets out of the rouble zone the better since the price
liberalisation strategy followed by the Russian government is inappropriate
for a state which does not export oil and therefore does not benefit from
putting prices up to world market levels.
There are doubts, however, that the new currency can be introduced in time -
while the coupon, which has replaced the rouble in many retail transactions,
is now trading significantly below the Russian rouble, giving ordinary
citizens a bad experience of their 'own currency'.
Meanwhile the roubles status in foreign exchange terms is fraught with
problems. At present, enterprises can buy foreign currency at the central
bank's currency exchange which gathers twice a week, and where the main
restriction is the limited offering of hard currency.
Citizens can, in principle, go to any bank and buy up to Dollars 500 at the
market rate if they want to travel abroad, while some private stores are
beginning to sell goods either for dollars or for roubles at the
corresponding market rate.
But the Russian currency has a long way to go before it becomes convertible
in the sense that people trust it sufficiently to hold it for any period of
time or to conclude significant contracts in roubles.
