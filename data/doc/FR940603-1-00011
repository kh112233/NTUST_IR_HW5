SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In the 

Federal Register

 of January 20, 1994 (59 FR 3043), FDA announced its plan to review significant regulations pursuant to Executive Order
12866, which requires all Federal agencies to develop a program for periodically reviewing existing significant
regulations. Under this plan, FDA is conducting a review of the regulations in 21 CFR parts 606, 607, 640, and 660, as
well as the portions of 21 CFR part 610 that apply to blood and plasma collection establishments and blood and blood
products; FDA is requesting public comment from interested parties on these regulations.


FDA is conducting a review of these regulations to determine whether they should be revised, rescinded, or continued
without change. FDA is also evaluating whether to review other regulations applicable to blood products and establishments,
including, but not limited to, 21 CFR parts 210 and 211. This request for comments is intended to assist the Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research in identifying regulations that are outdated, burdensome, inefficient, or otherwise
unsuitable or unnecessary from a regulatory standpoint and in need of revision to achieve their public health goals
more effectively. 
Under Executive Order 12866, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96511), and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (Pub. L. 96354), FDA is performing a review of these regulations to determine whether they are unnecessary
as the result of changed circumstances, duplicative, or inappropriately burdensome. This action is also intended
to incorporate the scientific advances in the field, to introduce, where appropriate, increased flexibility in
the regulations, and to further insure the safety, purity, and potency of blood and blood products by updating the
blood regulations. This document requests information and comments on these regulations. 
A request for comments on the general biologics and licensing regulations in 21 CFR parts 600, 601, and 610 will be published
elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.
Interested persons may, on or before August 17, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this document. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. FDA
requests that comments include the following information in the order shown: (1) The section affected in Title 21
of the CFR; (2) a description of the suggested change, including, if appropriate, suggested changes in the text of
the regulation; (3) the rationale for the change or the problem to be addressed by the change; (4) any related regulations
or guidance also affected by the suggested change; (5) any pertinent background information; and (6) whether the
comment includes attachments. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through
Friday.
