  [Text] Four people were arrested this morning in the Basque 
province of Guipuzcoa for their suspected links to ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty]. In France, a further 10 people were 
arrested; they are linked to ETA's network of people taking in 
terrorists. 
  A further 13 people had already been arrested. Four of them 
are suspected of belonging to ETA's (Kiruli) Commandos, and they 
are accused of murdering a Civil Guard in September, 1993 in 
Andoain, and of killing an employee of a Telefonica subsidiary 
they had mistaken for a policeman. 
  According to Jose Maria Gurruchaga Zapirain, the civil 
governor of Guipuzcoa, four ETA commandos used the arsenal found 
yesterday in the Guipuzcoa town of Usurbil. 
  He then went on to describe the operation as a big blow for 
ETA, because some of those arrested had been long-standing ETA 
members.
