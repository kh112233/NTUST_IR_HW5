SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that a temporary permit has been issued to Bumble Bee Seafoods,

Jalapeno in Oil'' that deviate from the U.S. standard of identity for canned tuna (21 CFR 161.190). The purpose of the
temporary permit is to allow the applicant to measure consumer acceptance of the products, identify mass production
problems, and assess commercial feasibility.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 This permit is effective for 15 months, beginning on the date the food is introduced or caused to be introduced into
interstate commerce, but not later than April 19, 1994.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In accordance with 21 CFR 130.17 concerning temporary permits to facilitate market testing of foods deviating from
the requirements of the standards of identity promulgated under section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (21 U.S.C. 341), FDA is giving notice that it has issued a temporary permit to Bumble Bee Seafoods, Inc., P.O. Box
85362, San Diego, CA 921865362.


The permit covers limited interstate marketing tests of canned tuna products formulated by adding chopped or diced
jalapeno peppers that have been previously prepared and packed in brine. The foods deviate from the U.S. standard
of identity for canned tuna in that the products contain diced or chopped green jalapeno peppers. The amount of jalapeno
peppers added will not exceed 10 percent of the water capacity of the can. Jalapeno peppers will replace part of the
liquid packing medium (water or oil) and will not affect the tuna fish fill portion. The test products meet all requirements
of the standard with the exception of this deviation. 
The firm previously held a temporary permit for these products which expired on March 1, 1993. Notice of issuance of
the permit and a subsequent amendment of the permit were published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 24, 1991 (56 FR 48212), and of July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32226), respectively. 
FDA finds that issuance of the new permit is in the interest of consumers because it will provide for a wider variety
of tuna products and allow for collection of additional data in support of a petition to amend the standard of identity
for canned tuna.
For the purpose of this permit, the names of the products are ``Chunk Light Tuna with Jalapeno in Water'' and ``Chunk
Light Tuna with Jalapeno in Oil.'' The information panels of the labels will bear nutrition labeling in accordance
with 21 CFR 101.9.
This permit provides for the temporary marketing of 300,000 cases containing 24 cans of tuna with jalapeno peppers
in spring water and 400,000 cases containing 24 cans of tuna with jalapeno peppers in soybean oil, each can weighing
175 grams (6 1/8 ounces). The products will be manufactured at Bumble Bee Seafoods, Inc., Santa Fe Springs, CA 90067,
and Bumble Bee International, Inc., Malecon Industrial Zone, Mayaguez, PR 00708. The products will be distributed
throughout the United States and its territories and possessions.
Each of the ingredients used in the food must be declared on the labels as required by the applicable sections of 21 CFR
part 101. This permit is effective for 15 months, beginning on the date the foods are introduced or caused to be introduced
into interstate commerce, but not later than April 19, 1994.
