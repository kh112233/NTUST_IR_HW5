  [Text] Brussels, Feb 16 (AFP) -- The European Commission 
hit 16 EC steel firms on Wednesday [16 February] with fines 
totaling ECU104 million (115 million dollars) for operating an 
illegal cartel, Competitions Commissioner Karel Van Miert said. 
  They were accused of having fixed prices and shared the 
market for heavy steel sections and beams used in the 
construction industry. 
  All of the big EC steel groups making such products were 
fined, including Luxembourg's Arbed company, British Steel, 
Preussag in Germany, and a subsidiary of French group 
Usinor-Sacilor. 
  The European Commission found that the companies had acted 
as 
a cartel since the mid-1980's, regularly exchanging information 
as well as having understandings on prices and market shares.
