METHODS OF TEACHING NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS 
Please, give succor to my thoroughly perplexed brain! On July 17, "O.C. 
Districts Search for Bilingual Teachers" described the extensive measures of 
school districts to find and hire Spanish-speaking teachers. Administrators are 
finding teachers from as far away as South America and the Midwest and 
attempting to entice them to Orange County. 
Then, a different article on the concluding page ("Schoolchildren Are Immersed 
in English") described how Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian children are being 
taught in English -- and succeeding! The second article even went so far as to 
state that "many of the Latino children tend to speak to each other in Spanish 
while the Asian children speak English among themselves as often as their 
native language." I wonder whether maybe the Asian students speak more English 
because they have been instructed in English. 
Why is the state forcing school districts to spend thousands of dollars and 
hours to dig up Spanish-speaking teachers when Asian students have demonstrated 
that non-English speaking students can learn English and then learn in English? 
Why not put Latino children in English immersion classrooms and offer them this 
equal shot at success instead of trying to draft anyone who can walk and speak 
Spanish to teach them? Why not search instead for teachers who understand 
second-language acquisition who can effectively teach children to understand 
and speak English well? 
The placement of Latino students in bilingual classrooms while Asian students 
are assigned to immersion programs amounts to racial segregation. What social 
problems are developing from this dual track system? 
On the other hand, bilingual education has its merits: What better way to 
prevent Latino achievement than by denying the means to educational success?
