FT  01 OCT 92 / Qataris in clash with Saudis
QATAR yesterday accused a Saudi Arabian force of attacking a border post in
a desert region, writes Our Foreign Staff. But the Saudis later claimed the
incident involved a gunfight between bedouin nomads within Saudi territory.
The flare-up highlights the sensitiveness of Gulf states over their border
areas inland and offshore.
The official Qatari news agency QNA said a Saudi military force killed a
corporal and an Egyptian working with the Qatari military and captured a
Qatari soldier. It said the clash damaged the al-Khofous border post about
130km south-east of Doha.
But the official Saudi Press Agency said there was an exchange of fire
between bedouins inside Saudi territory, resulting in the death of two
Qataris and one Saudi. 'Another Saudi was injured as a result of the
shooting, which was started by the Qataris,' the agency added.
Desert borders have been notoriously difficult to agree and have caused
squabbles even between closely allied countries. Qatar has a dispute with
Bahrain over territorial waters, while the United Arab Emirates is embroiled
in a growing crisis with Iran over control of three islands.
