data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing by December 5, 1994.


</DATE>
<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 123,
12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA has evaluated data submitted in 
accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C.
357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval to provide for bleomycin sulfate bulk drug substance. The
agency has concluded that the data supplied by the manufacturer concerning the antibiotic drug are adequate to establish
its safety and efficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR part
450 to provide for the inclusion of accepted standards for this product.


Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


Submitting Comments and Filing Objections


This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because when effective it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
on November 3, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before November 3, 1994, submit comments to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before November 3,
1994, a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before December 5, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.


List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 450


Antibiotics.



Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs, 21 CFR part 450 is amended as follows:


PART 450_ANTITUMOR ANTIBIOTIC DRUGS


1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 450 continues to read as follows:





Authority: 

 Sec. 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357).



2. Section 450.10 is added to subpart A to read as follows:


450.10 

Bleomycin sulfate. 


(a) 

Requirements for certification

_(1) 

Standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity

. Bleomycin sulfate is the amorphous sulfate salt of bleomycin. Bleomycin has been separated into several similar
glyco-peptide molecules. It is a cream-colored powder that is so purified and dried that: 
(i) Its potency is not less than 1.5 units and not more than 2.0 units of bleomycin per milligram. 
(ii) It contains no depressor substances.
(iii) Its loss on drying is not more than 6.0 percent.
(iv) Its pH in an aqueous solution containing 10 units per milliliter is not less than 4.5 and not more than 6.0.
(v) Its copper content is not greater than 0.1 percent.
(vi) Its content of various bleomycins is as follows: Bleomycin A

2 

 is not less than 55 percent and not more than 70 percent; bleomycin B

2

 is not less than 25 percent and not more than 32 percent; bleomycin B

4

 is not more than 1 percent. Bleomycins A

2

 and B

2

 should comprise not less than 85 percent of the total bleomycins.
(vii) It passes the identity test.
(2) 

Labeling

. It shall be labeled in accordance with the requirements of 432.5(b) of this chapter.
(3) 

Requests for certification; samples

. In addition to complying with the requirements of 431.1 of this chapter, each such request shall contain:

(i) Results of tests and assays on the batch for potency, depressor substances, loss on drying, pH, copper, content
of various bleomycins, and identity.
(ii) Samples required: For all tests: A minimum of 20 immediate containers.
(b) 

Tests and methods of assay

_(1) 

Potency

. Proceed as directed in 436.105 of this chapter, preparing the sample for assay as follows: Dissolve an accurately
weighed sample in sufficient 0.1

M

 potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (solution 16), to provide a stock solution of convenient concentration. Dilute
the sample thus obtained with solution 16 to provide a stock solution of convenient concentration. Further dilute
an aliquot of the stock solution with solution 16 to the reference concentration of 0.04 unit of activity per milliliter
(estimated).
(2) 

Depressor substances

. Proceed as directed in 436.35 of this chapter.
(3) 

Loss on drying

. Proceed as directed in 436.200(a) of this chapter, using the total contents of two or three vials.
(4) 

pH

. Proceed as directed in 436.2
02 of this chapter, using an aqueous solution containing 10 units per milliliter.
(5) 

Copper content

_(i) 

Reagents

. Dissolve 10 milligrams of zinc dibenzyldithiocarbamate in 100 milliliters of carbon tetrachloride.
(ii) 

Preparation of standard copper solution

. Accurately weigh 1.965 grams of cupric sulfate pentahydrate and transfer to a 1-liter volumetric flask. Dissolve
the material in 0.1

N

 hydrochloric acid, dilute to volume with 0.1

N

 hydrochloric acid, and mix well. Transfer 3 milliliters of this stock solution to a 1-liter volumetric flask, dilute
to volume with 0.1

N

 hydrochloric acid, and mix well. This standard copper solution contains 0.0015 milligram of copper per milliliter.
Transfer 10 milliliters of the standard copper solution to a 60-milliliter separatory funnel.
(iii) 

Preparation of the sample

. Accurately weigh approximately 15 milligrams of sample into a 60-millilter separatory funnel. Dissolve the sample
in 10 milliliters of 0.1

N

 hydrochloric acid.
(iv) 

Procedure

. To the separatory funnels containing the sample solution and standard copper solution, add 10 milliliters of the
zinc dibenzyldithiocarbamate solution and shake the funnels vigorously for 1 minute. Allow the phases to separate.
Filter the carbon tetrachloride phase (lower phase) through 1 gram of anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove excess water.
Using a suitable spectrophotometer equipped with 1-centimeter cells, and carbon tetrachloride as a blank, measure
the absorbance of the standard copper solution and the sample solution at 435 nanometers. Calculate the percent copper
as follows:


<TABLE>





1Percent copper 
1= 
1Absorbance of sample solution X 1.5 

2Absorbance of standard copper solution X Sample weight in milligrams 




</TABLE>


(6) 

Content of various bleomycin fractions

. Proceed as directed in 436.339 of this chapter.
(7) 

Identity test

. Proceed as directed in 436.211 of this chapter, using the method described in paragraph (b)(1) of that section,
using a 1 percent mixture.
