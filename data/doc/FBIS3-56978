  [Text] Moscow, Jan. 22 KYODO -- Russia alleges a number of 
Japanese fishing boats entered and stayed in Russian territorial 
waters Friday [21 January] and Saturday near Kunashiri Island, 
one of the Russian-held islands claimed by Japan, Japanese 
embassy officials said. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry filed a protest with the 
embassy, the officials said. 
  The Japanese embassy said it does not know what happened 
near 
Kunashiri. 
  ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY reported more than 50 Japanese vessels 
violated territorial waters on Friday and some 30 others on 
Saturday. 
  Russian border guards demanded that the Japanese leave but 
the boats stayed for more than five hours, ITAR-TASS said, 
quoting Nikolay Solovyev, head of the ministry's Asia-Pacific 
Affairs Bureau. 
  Three Japanese patrol boats were there but did not take any 
action, ITAR-TASS said. 
  Japan has long called for the return of the Russian-occupied 
islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai group of 
islets -- which the former Soviet Union seized immediately after 
World War II.
