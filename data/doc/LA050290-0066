VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME; 
SCIENCE ROOM DESIGN HEADS FOR BULGARIA 
High-tech classrooms meant to make studying science more fun will be built in 
Bulgaria under an agreement approved by the Hueneme School District. 
The district, which straddles the cities of Port Hueneme and Oxnard, has 
designed and built two of the high-tech classrooms at Blackstock and O. E. 
Green junior high schools in Oxnard. 
Used by the district's 1,720 junior high students, the classrooms contain 
equipment such as satellite dishes for watching educational television programs 
from around the world, built-in computers for researching science subjects and 
robotic arms for demonstrating tasks such as assembling electronic equipment. 
They were built with about $200,000 in state funds, including lottery money. 
The district, which is trying to patent the classroom design, has agreed to let 
the Bulgarian Academy of Science of Sofia, which is a junior high school, 
market and distribute the high-tech classroom in Bulgaria. The district has an 
exchange program with the Bulgarian academy that began in the fall. 
"We first want to help them get an edge on education, and it's a way to bring 
hard currency into the district," said Don Cody, an administrator for the 
district. 
If the Bulgarian school makes money from selling the design, then the Hueneme 
district would share in the profits, Cody said. Details of sharing the profits 
will be worked out later, he said. 
Supt. Ronald Rescigno added that the district is trying to set up a similar 
arrangement with other governments. SCOTT LAWRENCE
