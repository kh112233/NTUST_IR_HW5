FT  19 JUL 93 / The Week Ahead: SmithKline expected to be 10% ahead
RESULTS DUE
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, reports its second
quarter results on Tuesday.
Analysts are expecting a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 280m,
excluding any one-time exceptional items such as disposals to Wella and Sara
Lee.
The dividend is likely to be unchanged.
Sales are expected to be up by about 25 per cent in the pharmaceuticals
division and the group.
Both figures will be assisted by currencies. Analysts will be looking for
strong growth from Engerix-B, the hepatitis B vaccine, Seroxat, an
anti-depressant, Kytril, an anti-nausea treatment.
Relafen, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory for arthritis, and Augmentin,
an anti-biotic. The latter may overtake SB's anti-ulcer treatment Tagamet as
the company's most important drug.
The impact of the healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy will be carefully
monitored, as will the company's progress in the increasingly competitive US
market.
Waste Management International is expected to report on Monday interim
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 75m and Pounds 80m against Pounds 62.5m a
year earlier.
The company, floated by its US parent Waste Management which retain majority
control, has benefited from its joint venture with Wessex Water in the UK
and from expanding business in the Far East and Pacific Rim countries.
Full year profits for the year ending December are forecast at about Pounds
180m (Pounds 144m).
First Technology, a maker of crash dummies and security equipment for the
car industry, is forecast to turn in a big increase in pre-tax profits to
about Pounds 2m from (Pounds 0.6m) for the year to April.
