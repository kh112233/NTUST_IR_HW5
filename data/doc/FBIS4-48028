  [Text] Freetown, 10 May (AFP) -- Fifteen rebels of the 
Revolutionary United Front [RUF] and ten civilians were killed 
in a dawn attack by the guerrillas Sunday [8 May] near Kenema, 
240 kilometres (150 miles) east of Freetown, local journalists 
said. Government troops alerted by the sound of firing from the 
attack on Mano Junction had counter-attacked and driven the 
rebels off, they said. 
  For the past week the government has been engaged in an 
offensive against the RUF in the east of the country. Military 
sources said 52 rebels and ten government troops were killed in 
the first six days of the operation. The Defence Ministry also 
said a RUF training camp at Kerefay near Makeni, 140 kilometres 
northeast of Freetown, had been broken up last week and 60 
children aged from nine to 12 who had been forcibly recruited by 
the rebels had been freed.
