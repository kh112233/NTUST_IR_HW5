  [Text] Paris 3 May TASS -- Estonian Prime Minister Mart 
Laar arrived in Paris for a two-day official visit on Monday 
evening. It was learned here from diplomatic sources that he 
plans to discuss with French leaders the problem of European 
security, development of cooperation between Estonia and the 
European Union, the state of Russo-Estonian relations, and also 
the prospects for strengthening bilateral relations between 
Paris and Tallinn. 
  Estonia is showing interest in French Premier Eduard 
Balladur's initiative to conclude a pact on stability in Europe. 
It has already joined the NATO-proposed "Partnership for Peace" 
programme. Moreover, Estonia has concluded several commercial 
agreements with the European Union and is eager to sign a free 
trade agreement with it. Commenting on this, official 
representative of the French Foreign Ministry Richard Ducket 
said that Paris favoured an early conclusion of such an 
agreement.
