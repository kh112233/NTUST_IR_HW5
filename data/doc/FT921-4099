FT  11 MAR 92 / Malaysia alarmed by Burma's treatment of Moslem minority
MALAYSIA'S foreign minister, Mr Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, yesterday summoned
the Burmese ambassador in Kuala Lumpur to express concern over Rangoon's
treatment of its Moslem minority.
Its action was a sign of increasing international concern about events on
Burma's western border with Bangladesh. Up to 170,000 Burmese Moslems, known
as Rohingyas, have crossed into Bangladesh since last December, telling of
widespread atrocities by Burmese troops.
Burma's south-east Asian neighbours have been reluctant to exert pressure on
the military government in Rangoon to curtail human rights abuses, adopting
a policy which they describe as 'constructive engagement'.
The regime, which is also engaged in a battle with insurgents near its
eastern border with Thailand, ignored a 1990 election victory by an
opposition party and is detaining its leader, Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, who was
awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize.
According to the British Red Cross, 5,000 or more refugees, mainly the
elderly and women and children, are crossing into Bangladesh each day. Oxfam
says that a new camp should be built each day to accommodate the inflow, and
that the situation could worsen with the rainy season two months away. The
UN High Commissioner for Refugees has drawn up a Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.3m)
aid programme.
In Bangladesh yesterday, refugees said that Burmese soldiers had killed
hundreds of Moslems and detained thousands in western Arakan state in the
past two weeks.
Rangoon says the Rohingyas are not Burmese nationals and will not be allowed
to return.
