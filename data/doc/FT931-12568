FT  28 JAN 93 / Trade with China puts Mandalay on the road to riches: The
free-wheeling economic policy of Burma's junta has spawned a generation of
black marketeers
BURMA is supposed to be poor and oppressed, but you would have trouble
believing it at the Dynasty. Recently opened on the roof of a concrete
office block, Rangoon's most fashionable restaurant and night-club is
seething with noisy revellers and new money.
Not content with spending the equivalent of a government minister's monthly
salary on an indifferent Chinese meal (the menu includes the delightful but
mysterious Hot and Sour Mutton Fighting Ball), the Dynasty's nouveaux riches
diners cheerfully flaunt their remaining banknotes and stuff them into the
hands of the gyrating female singers on stage.
Mandalay, 350 miles to the north, looks even richer. Imported Japanese cars
cruise the streets; shops are full of colour televisions, hi-fi systems,
fake Ray-Ban sunglasses from Thailand, fancy watches and torch-clock-radios;
the market stalls are groaning with toys and textiles from India and China.
Neighbouring China is the key to Burma's new veneer of affluence.
For the past four years the generals in the Burmese military junta known as
the State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) have gradually freed the
economy from government control, tolerating the black market, liberalising
trade with China and giving free rein to the ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs
who dominate business in Burma as in the rest of south-east Asia. The Slorc
has also struck deals with the warlike tribes on the frontier.
The chief architect of Mandalay's free-wheeling economic policy is General
Tun Kyi, who until recently was the region's all-powerful military
commander. Even the fiercest opponents of military rule admire his
achievements. Mandalay, after all, has long been regarded more as a sleepy
repository of Burmese culture than as a business hub.
'Tun Kyi is the godfather of Mandalay,' says one Burmese businessman. 'If
the city needs an electric generator he has it imported from China and then
calls in the merchants and tells them to pay their share.' In return, of
course, the government turns a blind eye to the more dubious business
practices of the merchants. 'The point is, it works,' says the businessman.
The free trade boom has spawned a generation of flashy black marketeers;
they smoke imported 555 cigarettes and drink Changlee beer brewed in the
Chinese border province of Yunnan or Heineken shipped from Singapore; they
boast of their ability to buy police chiefs and immigration officers.
One such free trader explained how he exported gems and jade to China in
exchange for Chinese cassette players masquerading as Japanese brand-name
products. Mandalay, he declared with not a little hyperbole, 'will be like
Hong Kong in three years'.
At first glance it looks as though everyone is profiting from the boom. The
citizens of Mandalay say Gen Tun Kyi has repaired the market and beautified
the town; the Yunnanese have found a short and convenient trade route to the
sea, and China is investing in the repair and construction of Burmese roads
and bridges. The Burmese junta, isolated by the west because of its
miserable human rights record and its failure to release Ms Aung San Suu
Kyi, the detained opposition leader who won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has
found a powerful friend in China. Chinese arms salesmen are among those who
frequent the bars of Rangoon.
But prosperity and the fragile peace on the border have come at a price.
Guerrillas of the Wa and Kokang hill tribes, who are closely related to the
Yunnanese over the Chinese border, have stopped fighting the Rangoon
government, but only on the understanding that they are allowed to carry
weapons and trade in opium from their strongholds in the Golden Triangle.
China is worried about the spread of heroin addiction on its territory,
while the inhabitants of central Burma are appalled by the boorish way in
which some of the Wa and the Kokang flaunt their money in restaurants and
nightclubs, and resentful of the increasing influence of China and the
prosperous ethnic Chinese business community.
Since a great fire in Mandalay a decade ago, the ethnic Chinese are said to
have bought up the entire town centre with the exception of one small hotel
and one shop, and traders say Chinese nationals are buying Burmese identity
cards at the border.
The Slorc, mindful of the Burmese nationalism to which it constantly pays
lip service, has recently sought to moderate the spread of Chinese influence
and to exert more control over the border trade. Gen Tun Kyi has been
recalled to Rangoon, ostensibly to become trade minister, but actually,
diplomats believe, because his military colleagues feared he was becoming
too powerful in his Mandalay fiefdom.
Gen Tun Kyi and his Chinese friends, however, seem to be holding their own.
Although he has been theoretically replaced as military commander of the
central region, he is still occasionally referred to as the commander by the
official press. And in the karaoke bars of Rangoon, they are singing songs
in Chinese.
