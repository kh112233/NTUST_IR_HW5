FT  18 OCT 93 / TV accused of poll bias
JAPANESE television, which broke with its tradition of supporting the ruling
party in the July general election, could be forced to return to its old
compliant ways with the launching of an investigation into alleged biased
coverage.
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications last week started to
investigate TV Asahi, a national network, on charges of intentional bias in
its election coverage.
The network's executives are being questioned for violating the broadcasting
laws by instructing reporters to distort its campaign coverage in a way that
would help the popular reformist parties. Ministry officials say TV Asahi
could face up to three months' suspension from broadcasting if it has broken
the law.
The investigations come when the Japanese media, known for its cosy
relationships with bureaucrats and politicians, is being questioned over its
role in society. Recent coverage exposing political corruption by newspapers
and television seemed to represent a new, more western trend.
Although the Japanese constitution guarantees freedom of speech, the
telecommunications ministry, which controls broadcasting licences, points
out that broadcasting laws stipulating 'political fairness' come first.
TV Asahi denies the allegations, and says its coverage is fair. There has
been no public criticism over the government's probe, and the Japanese media
have even denounced TV Asahi for putting the freedom of reporting at risk.
Leaders of the LDP, who have been frustrated by recent political coverage,
have joined in the calls against TV Asahi.
