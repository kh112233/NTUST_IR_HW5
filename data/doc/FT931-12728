FT  27 JAN 93 / Havel is president of Czech Republic
MR Vaclav Havel, the former Czechoslovak president and playwright, last
night became the new Czech Republic's first president.
The election came in a secret ballot after a chaotic day in the Czech
parliament.
A bomb threat caused the parliament to be evacuated as the Czech Republic's
deputies were preparing to vote.
Earlier, deputies staged a mass walkout following a scathing attack on Mr
Havel by right-wing opponents. They had accused him of responsibility for a
crime wave of civil war proportions following his amnesty of prisoners
during his 1990-92 presidency.
Mr Havel, who has been the most popular Czech politician since the fall of
the communist regime in 1989, won 109 votes from the 200-member parliament
in the ballot.
In Bratislava, the Slovak parliament was also voting to elect a president
yesterday, but none of the four candidates running won enough parliamentary
votes to be elected.
Deputies are to vote again today after what are likely to be hectic talks
between parties to try to put together the necessary 90 votes needed for a
candidate's election in the 150-seat assembly.
The inconclusive first round is a setback for Mr Vladimir Meciar, prime
minister and leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), who
had backed Mr Roman Kovac, a former candidate member of the Slovak Communist
party and deputy prime minister.
