FT  10 DEC 93 / Elections in Russia: Fascist party enters Russian nightmares
If Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of Russia's extreme right-wing
Liberal Democratic party, does as well as two separate surveys conducted
this week indicate, the charismatic politician could command the second
largest bloc in the Russian parliament.
And if Mr Zhirinovsky forms an alliance with the Communists and the
Agrarians, who share his tough nationalist stance, hardliners could end up
controlling more than a quarter of the seats in parliament.
Even in this nightmare scenario, the extreme right would be less powerful
than the combined forces of the hitherto divided democrats. Mr Yegor
Gaidar's Russia's Choice group is still leading the polls and Mr Grigory
Yavlinsky's 'Yabloko' grouping, which advocates a different strategy for
market reforms, is coming in third. If the constitution is accepted on
Sunday, it would also give Mr Yeltsin the final say in forming the
government.
However, even in opposition, the hardline parties could exert a powerful,
and unsavoury, influence on the overall direction of Russian politics. Apart
from his promises to make life economically comfortable for all, Mr
Zhirinovsky's other trump card in the election campaign has been his pledge
to renew Russia as a great state.
'Russian soldiers will once again stand guard along the 1975 borders of the
Soviet Union, and, once we put them there, they will not move back a single
step,' a tired but triumphant Mr Zhirinovsky declared yesterday. 'The world
should think twice before opposing us - after all, is it really desirable to
have a third world war?'
Statements like these are standard fare for Mr Zhirinovsky. Bombastic and
outrageous though they may sound to western ears, for a significant number
of Russian voters, who have impotently watched both their country and their
pay cheques shrink over the past two years, Mr Zhirinovsky's message appears
to offer an attractive third way, - rejecting both the Communists and the
economic reform programmes of Russia's tried and tested democratic
politicians.
Mr Zhirinovsky says that he will not form a coalition with any other group.
Indeed, his campaign strategy is to remind voters that he represents a
'clean, untainted alternative' to both the communist past and the democratic
present. However, in foreign policy at least, he has a natural ally in Mr
Gennady Zyuganov's Communists, whose favourite 'ism' is nationalism.
Mssrs Zhirinovsky and Zyuganov enjoy another political advantage: both are
leaders of parties in which loyalty is the paramount virtue and thus are
likely to command more disciplined blocs in parliament than the more
independently-minded democratic groups.
Their combination of discipline and demagoguery could give these hardline
parties the power to push Russia's entire political spectrum to the right
and force Russian democrats to adopt a harder line in their relations with
the rest of the world.
