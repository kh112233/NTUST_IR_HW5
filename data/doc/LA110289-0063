SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 32 YEARS TO LIFE IN OFFICER'S MURDER 
A participant in a 1988 armed robbery in which an Inglewood police officer was 
slain was sentenced Tuesday in Torrance Superior Court to 32 years to life in 
state prison. 
Joevone Elster, 24, described by prosecutors as the mastermind of a bungled gas 
station holdup, was one of three men and a youth convicted of murder and armed 
robbery for the crime. Police say the fifth participant, who shot Sgt. George 
Aguilar during the getaway, committed suicide after a 45-mile chase the night 
of the robbery. 
Aguilar, a 15-year veteran who worked as an undercover narcotics officer, is 
the only Inglewood police officer to be murdered in the line of duty in the 
department's 81-year history. 
Still facing sentencing by Judge John P. Shook are Van Otis Wilson, convicted 
of first-degree murder, and Patrick Anthony Carr, convicted of second-degree 
murder. A 15-year-old defendant was sentenced to the California Youth Authority 
until he is 25.
