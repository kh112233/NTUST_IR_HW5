  [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has said 
the 45-month-old Iraq embargo has created a major burden for 
Jordan, noting that the United States wants to find a way to 
ease this burden. 
  At a news conference via satellite today, Christopher said 
he 
hopes that, during his upcoming meeting with His Majesty King 
Husayn, he will bring proposals to ease the effects of the naval 
blockade of the Port of al-'Aqabah. 
  He further asserted that he respects Jordan's stand refusing 
to sign a peace treaty with Israel before resolving all 
outstanding issues between the two sides. He characterized 
Jordanian-U.S. relations as excellent. 
  Christopher also praised His Majesty King Husayn's 
statements 
last week, saying he is sure that Jordan does not want to host 
terrorism on its territory or allow its territory to be used to 
propagate terrorism and extremism. 
  The U.S. secretary said his country's position on the status 
of the city of Jerusalem has not changed. He said the question 
of Jerusalem is the most difficult one and should be defined 
within the context of the final stages. 
  Regarding his Middle East tour, scheduled to begin next 
Monday, Christopher asserted that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are determined to make 
progress in the peace negotiations. He said that during his 
tour he will convey messages between the two sides. He said his 
country is not proposing any package deal on peace, noting that 
his mission is only to facilitate negotiations between the 
parties and to talk to them about any messages they want to 
exchange or explain.
