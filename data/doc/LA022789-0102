2,000 KEPT FROM HOMES 
Two thousand people forced to evacuate after a train derailment and fire had to 
stay away from their homes a second day today as firefighters waited for a rail 
car containing butane to stop burning. 
There were no serious injuries, officials said. Mayor Don Plusquellic told a 
news conference that residents probably would not be permitted to return to 
their homes until tonight. The fire forced schools to close and bus service to 
be canceled in this city of 250,000.
