50 ETHNIC ALBANIANS ARRESTED IN SOUTHERN YUGOSLAVIA UNREST 
More than 50 ethnic Albanians were jailed for up to 60 days after this week's 
unrest in the southern Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the official Tanjug news 
agency said Friday. 
One foreign student at Kosovo's Pristina University said he had seen police 
seize at least 10 students in Wednesday's unrest. He said he and other 
students, counting their numbers later, concluded that at least 50 more had 
been detained. 
"Police in riot gear stormed through the dormitory, kicking down doors and 
firing tear gas canisters through the hallways," he said. "Some students were 
dragged out of their rooms." 
Security in Kosovo was increased after police shot dead an ethnic Albanian on 
Tuesday in the town of Podujevo, and hundreds of students demonstrated in a 
revival of protests that resulted in the deaths of 24 people in March. 
The Albanians were protesting curbs on their political autonomy imposed by 
Serbia, the biggest of Yugoslavia's six republics. 
Police were stationed at crossroads leading into Pristina on Friday, and 
armored vehicles were parked on the outskirts. 
A police official said the hunt was still on for 12 to 15 Albanians who engaged 
police Tuesday in a gun battle near Podujevo. An ethnic Albanian police 
commander was shot dead in Podujevo in the March unrest. 
"We suspect this group was involved in the March events in Podujevo," the 
official said.
