Kan



r

 Gene 



As part of its discussion of the scientific issues related to the evaluation of Calgene's genetically engineered
tomato, the Food Advisory Committee discussed the possibility that the 

kan



r

 gene might be transferred to microorganisms in the GI tract and in the environment (Ref. 1). 
The committee members concluded that transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene consumed as a component of tomatoes to microorganisms in the GI tract was highly unlikely based on published data
in the scientific literature. Similarly, the committee members judged that the potential for transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene from plants to microorganisms in the environment is highly unlikely based on the members' knowledge of mechanisms
of gene transfer. In addition, members of the committee pointed out that the rate at which such transfer could take
place, if at all, was of so small a magnitude that, coupled with the high prevalence of kanamycin resistant organisms
already present in the environment, it would not cause a significant environmental impact. 
Some members of the committee, while convinced by the information presented at the meeting that the transfer of the


kan



r

 gene from tomato plants to microorganisms in the soil was improbable, expressed concern regarding the use of the 

kan



r

 gene in other crops that may be grown on a wide scale. In addition, some committee members were concerned that a determination
of safety with regard to the use of 

kan



r

 gene in Calgene's tomato might signal to producers that it is now permissible to use the 

kan



r

 gene in other crops. In light of such concerns, these committee members advised that use of the 

kan



r

 gene in other crops should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 


4. Agency Conclusions 


The agency has considered the recommendations of the members of the Food Advisory Committee. The agency agrees that
the potential transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene, as well as other antibiotic resistance marker genes, from crops to microorganisms should be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis. As noted, Calgene petitioned for the use of the 

kan



r

 gene product, APH(3
&rsquo;)II, in the development of genetically engineered cotton and oilseed rape in addition to tomato. As discussed
below, the agency has evaluated data and information concerning horizontal transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene from its use in all three crops. This is consistent with the committee's advice that safety of the use of the 

kan



r

 gene be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In addition, Calgene's petition seeks to amend the food additive regulations
to permit the use of APH(3
&rsquo;)II only in tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape; approval of Calgene's petition would not mean that developers
could use the 

kan



r

 gene in crops other than those identified in the petition. 
FDA has also evaluated the information submitted by Calgene and has determined that the probability of transfer of
the 

kan



r

 gene to gut microflora is remote and that even under worst-case conditions, the number of microorganisms that would
be converted to kanamycin resistance is negligible when compared to the reported prevalence of gut microflora that
are already resistant to kanamycin (Ref. 35). This conclusion applies to both humans and animals. The agency has determined
that exposure to foods that contain the 

kan



r

 gene will not compromise the efficacy of antibiotic treatment because the likelihood of increasing the number of
antibiotic resistant microorganisms is extremely low. Further, the agency has determined that there is no evidence
that free DNA containing the 

kan



r

 gene, even if present, can transform cells lining the GI tract (Ref. 2).
