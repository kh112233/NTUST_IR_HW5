Notification to ATC of Deviations From ATC Clearances and Instructions in Response to Traffic Alert and Collision
Avoidance System Resolution Advisories



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action proposes to codify a previously announced policy extended to pilots during the initial testing of TCAS,
during the Limited Implementation Plan (LIP) for TCAS, and during the actual implementation of TCAS under the TCAS
Transition Plan (TTP) that permitted pilots to deviate from an air traffic control (ATC) clearance or instruction
in non-emergency situations in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS) resolution advisory
(RA). The language contained in current regulations suggests that deviation from an ATC clearance is only authorized
in an emergency situation. This proposal would add the TCAS RA as a reason to deviate from a clearance. This proposal
would require that whenever a pilot deviates from an ATC clearance or instruction, ATC would be advised as soon as practicable.
This proposal is intended to clarify and define pilot reporting requirements in the event a pilot deviates from an
air traffic control clearance or instruction in response to a TCAS resolution advisory.
