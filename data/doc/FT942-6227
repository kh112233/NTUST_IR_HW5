FT  01 JUN 94 / UN goes to Rwanda camp
The United Nations sent investigators yesterday to a camp in government-held
territory in Rwanda where aid workers said 500 people were massacred, Reuter
reports from Kigali.
Rebels and government troops resumed fighting despite talk of a truce and UN
officials and witnesses reported that an officer serving with the UN force
was killed by a mortar blast just inside the government-held part of the
capital, Kigali.
The reported massacre was the latest indication that mass killings were
continuing in the central African nation, where half a million people are
estimated to have died in seven weeks.
