SHOW GOES ON DESPITE THEFTS 
Thefts have left major holes in a Westside hologram exhibit, but a companion 
show in Pasadena is still going strong. 
"Images in Time &amp; Space," including more than 70 rare holograms from around 
the world, are on display through December at Pasadena's McKinley Library. 
A carnival will be held at the Pasadena exhibit this weekend to raise money to 
replace 25 holograms stolen earlier this month from the Santa Monica show. The 
Pasadena exhibit was unaffected by the thefts, event organizer Utz Baldwin 
said, but the cost of replacing the stolen art is estimated at between $70,000 
and $100,000. 
Sponsored by the Canadian Associates of Science and Technology and billed as 
the most significant collection of international holograms ever, "Images in 
Time &amp; Space" includes pieces from the United States, Europe and the Soviet 
Union, Baldwin said. 
Holograms are laser-generated images that appear to be three-dimensional but 
are actually flat. They are used in art, business and science, Baldwin said. 
"Images in Time &amp; Space" is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at 
Pasadena's McKinley Library, 377 S. Oak Knoll Ave. Admission is $3.50 for 
adults, $3 for senior citizens and students, and $2.50 for children.
