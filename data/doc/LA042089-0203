LOCAL; 
10 ARRESTED IN BIGGEST-EVER BUST OF BOILER-ROOM INVESTMENT SCAMS 
Securities agencies from seven states have raided a dozen California 
boiler-room investment operations over the past 10 days, authorities said 
today, seizing evidence and arresting 10 suspects so far in the biggest 
multi-state telemarketing crackdown in history. 
The bulk of the boiler rooms were based in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
although others were located as far north as Sacramento County and as far south 
as San Diego. The firms are suspected of fleecing an estimated 10,000 victims 
in 50 states out of more than $50 million by soliciting investments in bogus 
precious metals and oil and gas schemes, said G. W. McDonald, chief of 
enforcement for the California Department of Corporations. 
Those arrested face felony charges of grand theft, securities fraud, 
commodities fraud, unlicensed activity and violations of the California 
telemarketing registration law, McDonald said at a press conference this 
morning in Los Angeles. The victims lost "nest eggs" ranging from as little as 
$1,000 to as much as $600,000 each, he said. 
The raids were coordinated under a recently expanded federal program called the 
Leviticus Project, named after the third book of the Bible, which states in 
part: "Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor." The project gives grants and 
interstate cooperation to boiler-room bashers in 20 states. California joined 
the project last September.
