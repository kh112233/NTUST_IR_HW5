FIRE BREAKS OUT IN RAIL TUNNEL UNDERNEATH WALDORF-ASTORIA 
A fire broke out today in a train tunnel underneath the block-long 
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in mid-town Manhattan, sending smoke into the lobby of 
the hotel and halting trains on a major commuter line just hours before the 
evening rush hour. 
Police said 14 employees on the Metro North commuter line, which operates out 
of Grand Central Station, suffered smoke inhalation. 
Rail officials feared the fire could have halted train service for several 
hours and play havoc with commuters trying to get home during the evening rush 
hour. 
Hotel spokesmen said there was no damage to the hotel and that the smoke was 
quickly cleared from the lobby. The fire was quickly extinguished.
