  [Text] The artillery fire of Jonas Savimbi's troops, 
determined to occupy the city of Kuito at any cost, once again 
violently shook the most densely populated part of the city, 
causing many victims. The shelling that began at dawn today, 
after a few hours break last evening, are being intensely felt 
throughout the city, following the ultimatum that Savimbi gave 
his men to take Kuito in the coming hours. 
  Thus, many troops, including Jonas Savimbi's personal guard, 
were concentrated on the outskirts of the city of Kuito and 
Kunge over the past few hours. This was revealed by a source 
from the government forces operational command. The source said 
the coming hours will be characterized by gunpowder, bloodshed, 
grief, and mourning, since apart from the shellings, intense 
clashes are already being waged in different parts of Kuito and 
Kunge between the government forces and the Black Cockerel's 
men. The shells fired by UNITA over the past 24 hours killed 83 
people and wounded 127 others, including journalist Fernando 
Daniel Luis, who is in a serious condition.
