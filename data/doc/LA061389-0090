MORNING REPORT: ART 
Authorities in Mexico City have recovered scores of priceless jade, gold and 
stone artifacts taken in the 1985 Christmas Day robbery of the National Museum 
of Anthropology. Federal agents found 133 of the 140 stolen treasures from the 
ancient Mayan, Aztec, Zapotec and Mixtec civilizations in canvas sacks stashed 
in a home in suburban Mexico City. Ten people were arrested after a series of 
raids on several residences. Among the items recovered were a Zapotec mask of 
the bat god Murielago and an obsidian Aztec sculpture of a monkey. Experts have 
described them as two of the most valuable pieces in a museum crammed with 
irreplaceable objects from civilizations dating back thousands of years. ALEENE
