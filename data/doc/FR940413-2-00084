SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On June 4, 1993, the Department published a Notice of Funding Availability for this program (58 FR 31848). A notice
correcting a date applicable to Category II grants was published on June 14, 1993 (58 FR 32958). This notice is for the
purpose of establishing a deadline of June 30, 1994, for the receipt of applications for Category II, Stage One, Lead-Based
Paint Hazard Reduction grants.



The Department has established this deadline for all Category II applicants because it has determined that the Category
II Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Grant Program is superseded by the Environmental Protection Agency Grant Program
authorized by the Residential Lead-Based Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (title X, Pub. L. 102550; approved October
28, 1992) (title X). Section 1021 of title X amends the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (TSCA),
by adding a new title IV, Lead Exposure Reduction. Title X gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the primary
responsibility for establishing State training, certification or accreditation programs.

Section 1011(g) of title X authorizes the Secretary to make grants of up to $200,000 to establish State training, certification,
or accreditation programs that meet the requirements of section 402 of the TSCA. Under section 402, the EPA is to promulgate
final regulations by April 28, 1994, governing lead-based paint activities, ``to ensure that individuals engaged
in such activities are properly trained; that training programs are accredited; and that contractors engaged in
such activities are certified.'' Section 402 also supersedes the provisions set forth under the headings ``Lead
Abatement Training and Certification'' and ``Training Grants'' in title III of the Departments of Veterans Affairs
and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1992 (Pub. L. 102139). Under
section 404(g) of the TSCA, the Administrator of the EPA is authorized to make grants to States to develop and carry
out authorized State programs.

The new deadline will apply to all potential applicants. In addition to this notice in the 

Federal Register, 

the Department is sending direct notification of the deadline change to all parties that have requested an application.
