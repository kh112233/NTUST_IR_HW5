FT  16 NOV 92 / Survey of Australia (8): Two-pronged strategy - Tourism
THE bulk of Australia's foreign earnings used to ride on the back of its
sheep. These days, a growing proportion ride on the seats of jumbo jets.
Last financial year, nearly 2.4bn international tourists arrived in
Australia, contributing ADollars 7.2bn to the coffers. This was about 10 per
cent of total foreign exchange receipts, the single largest earner,
outstripping the traditional wool and coal exports.
Mr Alan Griffiths, the tourism minister, expects 5bn tourists to arrive in
the year 2000, generating about ADollars 18bn.
The national strategy to achieve this target is two-pronged. First is an
advertising campaign to woo more Asian tourists - and thus lock in that
segment of the market which has propped up the industry during the past few
years.
The second part of the strategy is a shift in the Australian image being
projected abroad. The singlet-clad, beer-and-barbecue Australian lifestyle
depicted by Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan is being replaced by images of
sophisticated nightlife, first-class shops and fine restaurants, and
spectacular scenery.
Mr Hogan has successfully caught the imagination of the world market.
Australia is now recorded either the first or second most desired holiday
destination in its big markets.
Mr John Hutchison, managing director of the Australian Tourist Commission,
wants to convert that desire into bookings.
Asia, outside of Japan, is the main target of the advertising campaign.
Nearly half of a ADollars 28m advertising budget is being spent on campaigns
in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand and
Indonesia. The rest is being spent in North America and New Zealand.
Accompanying the marketing campaign is a frantic pace in bilateral air
negotiations to increase capacities to and from Malaysia, Indonesia and
Singapore. And with the deregulation of the air routes, the privately-run
Ansett airlines has also jumped in, applying for flying rights to Malaysia.
In 1991-92 the number of Asian tourists, excluding Japanese, rose 28 per
cent from the previous year's figure, making the region the fastest-growing
source of inbound tourists. The Bureau of Tourism Research (BTR) says
tourists from these markets will increase by an average 12 per cent to the
year 2001. This compares with a 10 per cent growth expected in the Japanese
market, the main source of tourists.
Last year the fastest-growing market was Taiwan, which delivered a 134 per
cent increase in visitor arrivals. The number of tourists from Thailand rose
31 per cent, from Singapore 26 per cent, and from Hong Kong 26 per cent.
But Japan remains the richest market, with more than 500,000 Japanese
visiting Australia last year. While Japanese tourists do not stay long, they
spend the most money among foreign tourists. According to BTR, Japanese
tourists stay an average of eight nights and spend an average of ADollars
1,371 excluding package tours and air fares. In contrast, tourists from the
US stay an average of 29 nights and spend an average of ADollars 2,091.
The Japanese spending pattern is partly attributed to local Japanese tour
operators promoting the 'Japanese connection.' Japanese banks and investors
are heavily exposed to the Australian hotel industry. During the five-star
hotel boom of the middle and late 1980s, Australia built nearly 110,000
luxury hotel rooms worth about ADollars 30bn. Japanese investors including
Kumagai Gumi and Daikyo went on a buying spree and snatched 80 per cent of
the projects.
In 1990, these five-star hotels were valued at ADollars 22bn. Last year the
Building Owners and Managers Association hired an independent auditor who
valued the assets at ADollars 10bn.
And while Japanese investors are trying to unload their interests, Japanese
tourists are helping ease the pain by patronising the Australian tourist
market.
The glut in luxury hotel rooms has itself helped boost Australia's
desirability as a tourist destination. With owners forced to charge economy
rates for first-class rooms and service, it has gained a reputation of being
a holiday destination of excellent value.
