FT  19 OCT 92 / Calvi probe backs murder theory
MR ROBERTO CALVI, the former chairman of Italy's Banco Ambrosiano who was
found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London 10 years ago, could not
have committed suicide but was murdered, according to the latest report on
the circumstances of his death.
Mr Calvi was found hanging from scaffolding at the bridge over the Thmes in
June 1982, days before Italy's then largest private bank collapsed with
Dollars 1.3bn missing. The money had been lent to overseas dummy companies
controlled by the Vatican's bank.
The circumstances surrounding Mr Calvi's death have never been fully
explained. An initial coroner's verdict in London of suicide was later
overturned by a second inquest that produced an open verdict. However, a
civil tribunal in Milan decided in 1989 that Mr Calvi was murdered.
Mr Calvi's widow and son say a private investigation they commissioned has
new evidence showing that he could not have committed suicide.
The suicide theory holds that Mr Calvi approached the bridge's scaffolding
from the river's foreshore. However, the investigation by Kroll Associates,
the international investigations company, has used new techniques in
analysing forensic material to establish that Mr Calvi died 1.at high tide,
when that route would have been impassable.
Mr Calvi's family, which has sent a report of the investigation to Mr
Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, hope that the findings will intensify
investigations into his death.
