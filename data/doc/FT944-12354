FT  02 NOV 94 / British tourists are set free
Three British tourists - Paul Ridout, Christopher Croston and Rhys Partridge
 -held hostage by Kashmiri militants were freed by Indian police yesterday,
less than 24 hours after the authorities discovered they had been kidnapped.
Two policemen and one kidnapper were killed in a 20-minute pre-dawn shootout
after Uttar Pradesh state police stormed a militant hideout in Saharanpur,
near New Delhi, to rescue the Britons. Police believe three more militants
were involved in the kidnapping and have launched a massive hunt to trace
them. The three were handed over to the British High Commission yesterday.
Al Hadeed, a hitherto unknown militant group, had left a note at the BBC
office in New Delhi on Monday afternoon, demanding the release of eight
Kashmiri militants or threatening to kill the three British hostages.
Police said they were able to locate the Britons so swiftly because of a
tip-off from Mr Bela Joseph Nuss, an American tourist whom they rescued by
coincidence in Ghaziabad on the outskirts of Delhi on Monday.
