PHILIPPINE REBELS KILL POLICE SERGEANT 
Communist rebels shot and killed a Philippine police sergeant in their second 
attack in a week near a major U.S. military air base, police said Thursday. 
Sgt. Jose Galura was sitting in his jeep outside a public market in Guagua, 30 
miles north of Manila, when three men shot him in the head Wednesday. 
The attack occurred 12 miles south of Clark Air Base, one of two big U.S. 
military facilities in the Philippines. Rebels killed Mayor Javier Hizon of 
nearby Mexico town and his security aide Jan. 5.
