2ND MAN SEIZED IN SHOOTING OF OFFICER 
A manhunt has ended with the arrest of a second suspect in the July 29 shooting 
of a California Highway Patrol officer whose life was saved by a bulletproof 
vest. 
Matthew Lee Allen, 34, was arrested at his Vallejo home, a CHP spokesman said. 
Officer Eugene Mulata was shot twice in the chest and four times in the back 
after making a traffic stop near Crockett. Because he was wearing a bulletproof 
vest, he suffered only minor injuries. 
Investigators said Allen handed a .44-caliber revolver to Jeffery Shawn 
Rendall, 29, of American Canyon after the officer stopped their stolen pickup 
truck for speeding. Rendall is suspected of firing the shots. 
Rendall was arrested last Monday after a police dog found him in a crawl space 
under a building in Crockett. Why Allen returned home and where he had been 
hiding was not known.
