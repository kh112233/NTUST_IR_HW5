  [Text] Beijing, Feb 18 (AFP)--China brushed aside Friday a 
warning from Vietnam against sending oil exploration vessels to 
the disputed Spratly islands, and denied breaching any bilateral 
agreement with Hanoi. 
  "China has indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly islands 
and their adjacent seas," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
  Following reports that two Chinese prospecting ships were on 
their way to the Spratlys, Vietnam warned China on Thursday that 
their presence would violate an agreement to avoid complicating 
negotiations on the disputed archipelago. 
  Since China and Vietnam normalised relations in 1991, both 
sides have repeatedly accused each other of violating their 
sovereignty over the tiny atolls. 
  "It is entirely justifiable and legitimate for Chinese ships 
to conduct inspection activities on the adjacent seas of the 
islands," the spokesman said, adding that "the question of 
violating written agreements between Vietnam and China does not 
exist." 
  As well as China and Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, the 
Philippines and Brunei all claim at least some of the islands, 
which are near vital shipping lanes and are believed to lie 
above substantial oil reserves.
