  [Text] Shikoku Research Institute (in Takamatsu City; 
Hirofumi Inoue, director), a subsidiary of Shikoku Electric 
Power Co., is tackling the development of a new 
energy-conservation system that will use large volumes of 
hydrogen gas, which are generated as a by-product in the 
production of sodium hydroxide, in fuel cells. Shikoku Electric 
Power Co. hopes that the use of that hydrogen in fuel cells will 
significantly increase the efficiency of electric power 
generation over that of power generation by burning hydrogen, 
which takes place in the dozens of sodium hydroxide plants 
around Japan. 
  Fuel cells provide a way of producing electricity by means 
of 
a process that is the reverse of water electrolysis. Because 
hydrogen and oxygen are the fuel, fuel cells are expected to 
become the next generation of clean power generation that causes 
very little environmental pollution. 
  The project involves setting up a 100-kW-output phosphate 
fuel cell in a sodium hydroxide plant in Tokushima City in 1994. 
The idea is to raise the power generation efficiency, which is 
now limited to 26% in the boiler systems that burn 
hydrogen, to 
42% or more by 1) recycling the 20% or so of 
hydrogen that is 
discharged from the fuel cell as is, without being reacted, and 
2) by using the 170 water vapor that is produced during the 
reaction process for energy within the plant. 
  In addition, the equipment needed to produce hydrogen from 
liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the case of typical fuel cells 
can be eliminated. The new concept also has merit in that the 
fuel cell's direct current can be used as is in the electrolysis 
of salt water, the raw material. 
  If it can be demonstrated that the efficiency will increase 
as calculated with the use of that small fuel cell, Shikoku 
Research Institute will conduct studies to see whether or not 
output can be expanded to several thousands of kilowatts, and, 
in the case where all of the hydrogen produced by a plant is 
used, whether or not the system can function well. 
  The total cost of the project is about &yen;439 million. 
About two-thirds of that will come from the government's 
``Energy Conservation Subsidies'' (subsidies to cover the costs 
of developing and making practical technology for rationalizing 
energy usage). ``If we can reduce the per-kilowatt cost of the 
equipment, which is more than five times higher than that of a 
boiler, that will be enough to make the system practical,'' says 
H. Yamamoto, head of the institute's energy research department.
