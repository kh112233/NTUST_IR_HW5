  [Text] The Angolan UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] rebel group has allegedly bayonetted to 
death 170 civilians in the northern district of Calulo. A local 
government official says the killings took place over the past 
two weeks. Those killed were apparently accused of being 
traitors and government supporters. Several hundred people have 
fled the region and 18 people from Calulo have died of hunger.
