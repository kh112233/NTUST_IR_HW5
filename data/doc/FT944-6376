FT  30 NOV 94 / Indian minister escapes blast
Maoist guerrillas have killed nine people, including seven policemen, with a
landmine in southern India but missed a state minister they were trying to
assassinate, a police official said. The guerrillas detonated the mine when
a lorry carrying the policemen approached Warangal Town, a Maoist stronghold
in Andhra Pradesh. 'They were aiming at Mr Narasimha Reddy, following in a
car,' the official added. Mr Reddy, a staunchly anti-Maoist minister in the
state government, is a candidate for Warangal in the December 1 and 5 state
assembly elections.
