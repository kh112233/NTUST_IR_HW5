SHORT TAKES; 
JACKSON WON'T ACT IF SEAT WON 
Academy Award-winning actress Glenda Jackson says she will give up acting if 
she wins a seat in Parliament as a member of the Labor Party. 
"You can't be a part-time MP (member of Parliament), and you certainly can't be 
a part-time actor," said Jackson, 53, after she was chosen Tuesday by Labor 
locals in the Hampstead and Highgate areas of North London. 
Jackson, winner of best actress Oscars for the 1970 film "Women in Love" and 
1973's "A Touch of Class," will vie for the seat held by a member of Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative party. 
Britain's general elections must be held before mid-1992 but can be called at 
any time by the government.
