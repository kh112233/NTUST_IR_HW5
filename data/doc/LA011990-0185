NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
HELMSLEYS MEET THEIR PEOPLE 
Hotel chain owner Leona Helmsley, awaiting an appeal of her tax evasion 
conviction, toured a beachfront hotel she owns with her billionaire husband, 
Harry. 
About 20 employees of the Sandcastle on Lido Key welcomed the couple with 
banners and yellow roses Wednesday. 
"I don't know any of them," the beaming Mrs. Helmsley said. "But I love them. 
People are people." 
As the Helmsleys inspected the hotel grounds, Mrs. Helmsley, 69, turned often 
to check on her 80-year-old husband, who has had health problems and often 
lagged behind his wife. 
Harry Helmsley was deemed too ill to stand trial with his wife, who was 
sentenced Dec. 13 to four years in prison and $7.1 million in fines for tax 
evasion.
