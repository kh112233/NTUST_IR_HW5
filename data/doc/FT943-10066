FT  08 AUG 94 / Rome launches TV campaign
The government of Italian prime minister and media magnate Silvio Berlusconi
has launched a TV advertising campaign to try to improve its battered image.
The first of the 45-second slots, accompanied by the slogan 'Facts which
citizens should know to exercise their rights', was broadcast on Saturday
and outlined the achievements of the right-wing coalition government since
its election in March. Mr Berlusconi already controls three private
television channels which opponents say he exploits for his political ends.
Italian law allows the government to use the media to publish information of
'social relevance' but the advertisements have sparked a row over political
bias. The opposition has demanded a similar platform. Mr Mauro Paissan, a
member of the opposition and vice-president of the parliamentary commission
on RAI (state radio and television), criticised Mr Berlusconi. 'These
advertisements that Berlusconi has made are propaganda in favour of the
government and of no help to the citizen at all,' he told Sunday's La
Repubblica newspaper. The government has just weathered a storm over the use
of preventive detention custody and conflicts of interest stemming from Mr
Berlusconi's continuing ownership of Fininvest, the holding company which
groups his many business interests.
