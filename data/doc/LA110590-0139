SHORT TAKES; 
STOLEN ARTWORK FOUND, MAN HELD 
A $320,000 French painting snatched from a gallery wall was recovered in a New 
York apartment, police said Sunday. 
A 46-year-old man was arrested and charged with burglary. 
The canvas by Maurice Utrillo was one of several paintings -- together 
estimated to be worth up to $1 million -- found at the apartment in Brooklyn, 
said Sgt. Norris Holloman, a police spokesman. 
Police didn't know if the others had also been stolen. 
Balazs Gabor was arrested and charged with burglary and possession of stolen 
property. 
The Utrillo painting, "Rue a Montmartre," a 1926 work showing a Paris street, 
was stolen last Tuesday from the Soufer Gallery in Manhattan.
