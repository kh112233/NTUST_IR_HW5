Bangor-Hydro Electric Co.; Intent to Hold a Public Meeting in Bangor, Maine, to Discuss the Draft Environmental Impact
Statement (DEIS) for the Proposed Basin Mills Project and Existing Stillwater and Milford Projects



November 21, 1994.



On November 10, 1994, the Commission staff mailed the Lower Penobscot River Basin DEIS to the Environmental Protection
Agency, resource and land management agencies, and interested organizations and individuals. This document evaluates
the environmental consequences of: (1) Constructing and operating the license applicant's proposed Basin Mills
project which consists of a new 38 mega-watt (MW) Basin Mills hydroelectric development, expansion of the existing
Veazie hydroelectric development from 8.4 to 16.4 MW and decommissioning of the existing 2.3 MW Orono development;
(2) continuing operation of the applicant's existing 1.95 MW Stillwater project; (3) expanding the applicant's
existing Milford project from 6.4 MW to 8 MW; and (4) alternatives to the applicant's proposals.

The DEIS evaluates five alternatives for the Basin Mills proposal: No action (deny Basin Mills license, continue
existing operation of Veazie and Orono); BHE's proposal; BHE's proposal with additional staff-recommended mitigation;
not constructing Basin Mills but relicensing Veazie, with or without increased capacity, in combination with decommissioning
or refurbishing Orono; and not constructing Basin Mills, decommissioning and removing Veazie dam, and refurbishing
Orono.

Alternatives for the Stillwater and Milford projects include: No action; applicant's proposal; and applicant's
proposal with staff-recommended mitigation.

The public meeting, which will be recorded by an official stenographer, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. on Tuesday, December
13, 1994, at the Ramada Inn, 357 Odlin Road (Exit 45B off I95), in Bangor, Maine.

At the meeting, resource agency personnel and other interested persons will have the opportunity to provide oral
and written comments and recommendations regarding the DEIS for the Commission's public record.
