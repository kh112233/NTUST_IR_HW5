FT  12 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): A clear sense of direction
Pity the tourist struggling to read a street map in the wind, or the
telephone engineer trying to understand cable diagrams at the bottom of a
maintenance pit.
British inventor Jeffrey Woolf has come to the rescue with a hand-held
plastic viewer which can be loaded with shrunken credit card-sized maps or
diagrams.
Known as the the MicroMap, the viewer has a self-adjusting magnifying glass
which keeps the map in focus no matter what the viewing angle. It can also
be fitted with tiny glowing 'beta' lights for illumination.
His company, Cascade Corporation, is looking for manufacturers to license
the invention. Cascade Corporation: UK, 071 233 6788.
