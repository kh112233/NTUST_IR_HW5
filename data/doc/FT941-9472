FT  15 FEB 94 / Container 'could withstand bomb'
Royal Ordnance, the BAe munitions and guns arm, said yesterday it had
developed a baggage container which could withstand an explosion equal to
the bomb that destroyed a Pan American jet over Lockerbie in Scotland in
1988, killing 270 people.
The containers, which arrived at Heathrow yesterday for loading tests, could
be fitted in some aircraft by the end of the year.
The containers slow down the effects of an explosion, Royal Ordnance said
yesterday. A controlled explosion the size of the Lockerbie bomb only popped
three rivets on an aircraft's body, it added. It began developing the
containers immediately after the Lockerbie bomb.
Royal Ordnance, which would not discuss the material used in the containers,
said it would not manufacture them itself but would license other companies
to do so. British Airways said if they met cost criteria, it would
voluntarily begin to use them.
