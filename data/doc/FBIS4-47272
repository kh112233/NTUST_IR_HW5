Confirm That Russia Has Ball-Sized Neutron Bomb''] 
  [Text] (Reuters) -- Journalists of British television's 
Channel 4 conducted an investigation and came to the conclusion 
that Russian scientists have invented a miniature neutron bomb 
the size of a baseball. The device was created by using what is 
called ``red mercury.'' 
  The bomb's small dimensions make it very attractive to 
terrorists. Dr. Sam Cohen, creator of the American neutron bomb, 
stated, ``This information terrifies me.'' 
  In conventional nuclear weaponry, plutonium is used to 
initiate a thermonuclear reaction. In the Russian device, ``red 
mercury,'' which Russian science discovered 40 years before the 
United States, acts as an igniter. 
  Doctor Cohen supposes that Russian scientists have created a 
bomb no bigger than a baseball. It has a power of 10 metric tons 
of TNT, and its radiation is dispersed over a 600-meter radius, 
destroying everything living and leaving an insignificant 
background after itself. 
  Speculation regarding ``red mercury'' arose not long ago. 
``As far as we know, no unique material called `red mercury' 
exists, stated Great Britain's Ministry of Defense. Materials 
called `red mercury' have been subjected to expert examinations 
and deemed useless.'' 
  When he was in Siberia, Russian ultranationalist 
Zhirinovskiy 
threatened more than once to use the secret weapon ``Elipton'' 
against Bosnian Moslems. 
  Channel 4 television reporters met with scientists in 
Russian 
and traveled to Yekaterinburg, where RM20/20 ``red mercury'' is 
said to be produced at a secret plant. British expert Frank 
Barnabey took part in these conversations and finally came to 
the conclusion, ``I am certain that Zhirinovskiy was telling the 
truth.'' 
  From the editor: For an explanation, IZVESTIYA 
correspondent Nikolay Burbyga turned to the ministries and 
departments that deal with weaponry. 
  ``Of course, we have`` secret developments,'' they said at 
the Ministry of Defense, but what British television reporters 
are stating is totally absurd. You should even be ashamed to 
comment on it.'' 
  The answers obtained at the Kurchatov Institute were no less 
categorical. Specialists involved with prospective scientific 
weaponry developments stated that ``red mercury'' has been 
talked about for a long time. But no one has succeeded in seeing 
it or ``touching'' it because a material with such 
characteristics simply does not exist in nature.
