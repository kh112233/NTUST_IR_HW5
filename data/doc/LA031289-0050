MARY BETH WHITEHEAD'S ROLE -- AFTER BABY M 
Will Mary Beth Whitehead never go away? 
Baby M is now 3 years old. The courts have ruled, and re-ruled, about who 
should get custody of her. Even Mary Beth Whitehead-Gould acknowledges that she 
and the Sterns have buried the hatchet. Thus, I was appalled to open the paper 
and see Whitehead-Gould using a public forum to state her case yet again 
("After Baby M" by Donald P. Myers, Newsday, March 6). 
In your long article Whitehead-Gould asks sarcastically, "What did Bill Stern 
do? He put some sperm in a cup." She says that the judge who originally awarded 
custody to the Sterns is a "rotten, horrible man, and I don't know how he 
sleeps at night." Further, "When she grows up, Sassy (Baby M) may look at Bill 
Stern and say, 'How could you do that to my mother?' " She also says that "(the 
Sterns are) naive to think that this child is not going to have problems." 
I cannot help but wonder what will Melissa Stern think when she grows up and 
discovers that her biological mother has profited from the telling of her 
misfortune? What will Melissa Stern think when she's old enough to realize that 
her biological mother continued to denigrate both her father and the woman who 
raised her, in public, years after the courts had made their decision? What 
will Melissa Stern think when she realizes that her biological mother would not 
let her grow up peacefully, and quietly?
