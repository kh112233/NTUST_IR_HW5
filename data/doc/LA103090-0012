HOODWINKED THEN, CLEANING HOUSE NOW 
If voters impose Proposition 140's severe term-limits on the California 
Legislature, its members will have themselves to blame. They gerrymandered 
their districts so effectively during the 1980s that they made it extremely 
difficult for voters to displace them. 
Term limits are not a good answer to the problem, but voters now seem likely to 
seize on the proposal as their only way of throwing the rascals out. 
Instead of across-the-board term limits, the right reform would be to eliminate 
gerrymandering and to create districts in which both parties had a chance to 
win and voters had better opportunities to defeat incumbents. 
But repeated efforts to reform the redistricting process failed during the 
1980s. The Democratic legislative leadership -- with the quiet approval of some 
Republican legislators who like the status quo even if it means being the 
long-term minority party -- financed misleading campaigns that distorted the 
redistricting issues and hoodwinked voters into defeating reform initiatives. 
In their efforts to defeat Proposition 140, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and 
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti have hired the same consulting team of 
Michael Berman and Carl D'Agostino, whose campaigns of deceit and distortion 
persuaded voters to turn down redistricting reform measures. It will be much 
harder to obfuscate the issues this time, however: Voters are much more likely 
to grasp the idea behind term limits -- throwing the rascals out, even if it 
has the unfortunate effect of throwing out some decent and useful lawmakers 
along with the rascals.
