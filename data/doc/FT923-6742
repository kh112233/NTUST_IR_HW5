FT  22 AUG 92 / IMF to help Lithuania with currency
THE International Monetary Fund is ready to help the Baltic state of
Lithuania introduce its own currency, IMF managing director Michel Camdessus
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Vilnius.
'The IMF probably will be ready to help Lithuania to introduce its own
currency in October,' Mr Camdessus said. Lithuania plans to replace the
rouble with its own litas currency in October.
Speaking at the end of a three-day visit to the former Soviet republic, Mr
Camdessus said he was satisfied with Lithuania's moves towards privatisation
and the government's efforts to balance its budget.
Lithuanian radio quoted an official from the country's Ministry of
International Economic relations saying that Lithuania expected the IMF to
provide an Dollars 85m (Pounds 44.5m) stabilisation fund to help back the
new currency. Mr Camdessus declined to confirm this figure.
Estonia was the first former Soviet republic to abandon the rouble currency
when it introduced its kroon in June with the help of a Dollars 40m IMF
stabilisation fund. Latvia is also getting ready to introduce its own
currency, the lat.
