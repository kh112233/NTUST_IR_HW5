FT  18 MAY 94 / Jobs: Managing creativity takes talent - Time to meet the
challenge of working with thinkers
What sort of workforce do we want? It is a question attracting increasing
attention from managers and recruiters, particularly those whose business
and products are in a constant state of development. Demand is growing for
the thinking employee, yet too many companies seem wedded to management
principles ill-suited to invention.
Fears have been raised recently that some of the latest performance
monitoring programmes are suppressing rather than cultivating creativity
among innovative staff.
A report from The British Psychological Society in March criticised the
application of such practices among creative people. The report was gloomy
enough for employers concerned to encourage self-improvement among their
workforces; if anything it may have understated the extent to which
managements may need to address the problem.
Philip Sadler, a management consultant and vice president of Ashridge
Management College, believes that innovation is often stifled by outmoded
management thinking that should have been thrown out with Bakelite
telephones.
He believes the time could be ripe for many companies to dump their
allegiance to two old theories which form the bedrock of management
practices that persist today. The first is Taylorism, the scientific
management principles of Fredrick W. Taylor, who argued that workers were
less efficient if they exercised such traits as discretion, initiative or
spontaneity.
Taylor held that all work could be analysed and that the best way of
performing a job could be organised scientifically. Because managers were
more intelligent and better educated, he argued, they were in the best
position to decide how work should be done.
His theories are more associated with repetitive production line work, much
of which has been overtaken by technology, but Sadler believes that
Taylorism is 'alive and well' among top management who are attempting to
define competencies required for the successful performance of jobs.
The second theory that Sadler criticises is that of Max Weber, the German
sociologist. His Theory of Social and Economic Organisation, published in
1924, outlined a bureaucratic approach to office work and administration,
stressing qualities such as precision, order, hierarchy and authority.
Sadler says that while such practices may traditionally have been associated
with government departments and public-sector bodies, they also thrived and
continue to flourish in the private sector.
In last month's Personnel Management magazine, Sadler wrote: 'Bureaucracy
stifles talent, particularly creativity, and its strong emphasis on
authority, seniority and the proper channels means that new ideas find
difficulty in acceptance and that risk avoidance is more highly valued than
innovation.'
Neither theory seems acceptable for organisations that have changed from
mass production with large workforces to demanding continual changes and
constantly improving processes and products from smaller creative working
groups.
Sadler asks whether managements are meeting the new corporate demands. One
which has developed practices to stimulate talent, he says, is Merck, the US
pharmaceuticals company, which has been voted by a jury of more than 8,000
executives the most admired company in the US for the past six years.
Merck values scientific excellence as much as managerial competence. Among
its motivational programmes for scientists is an award scheme to bring them
recognition among their peers and stock options spread over stages of
research and development which only become exercisable when the product has
been launched successfully on the market.
Sadler believes that too few companies are prepared to develop their
creative people who, if deprived of management training at an early stage,
can become hostile to management. 'They often regard managers as thick and
stupid,' he said.
Sadler likes to draw a sporting analogy when discussing the management of
talented people. The characteristics of talent management, he suggest, are
nowhere more simply defined than in Association Football and the possession
of talent by itself is not enough to guarantee high achievement.
This has been demonstrated by a string of skilful soccer players over the
years who rarely achieved more than a brief appearance in the England side.
Players like Frank Worthington and Stan Bowles could dazzle the opposition,
but they lacked the overall vision that marked out great players. Franz
Beckenbauer, Johan Cruyff and Jack Charlton not only performed consistently
on the pitch but continued into successful managerial careers.
Football clubs place values on their teams, but balance-sheet valuations for
people have not been extended into industry. If they were, managers might
begin to appreciate their assets more.
The successful formula for managing what Sadler calls 'gold-collar workers'
is simple: attract the best people, keep them, develop them, motivate them
and manage their performance. Putting this into practice is less easy and
challenges traditional management thinking. Those who do may find it pays
dividends.
Philip Sadler's book on the subject, Managing Talent, is published by F. T.
Pitman.
