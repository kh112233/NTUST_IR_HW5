FT  15 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Georgian train crash
At least 15 people were killed and 30 injured when a passenger train crashed
into a stationary freight train just outside the Georgian capital, Tbilisi,
after a signalling error, railway officials said yesterday.
Guguly Mayduradze, deputy director of the Georgian railways, said the likely
cause of the accident was a mistake by station staff who failed to check
whether the track was free before allowing the passenger train to proceed.
