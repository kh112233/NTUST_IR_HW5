FT  19 OCT 94 / Tagamet's US sales fall 76% in quarter: SmithKline Beecham's
new drugs offset loss of patent
US sales of Tagamet, once SmithKline Beecham's best-selling drug, collapsed
by 76 per cent in the third quarter to Pounds 31m after the expiry in May of
patent protection for the ulcer remedy.
Mr Jan Leschly, chief executive of the Anglo-US drugs group, admitted
yesterday that the fall was 'dramatic' but said it 'was not totally
unexpected'. He said sales declines after recent patent expiries at other
drugs companies had been comparable.
Third-quarter figures showed that Tagamet's weakness was partly offset by
new drugs, sales of which rose 83 per cent at constant exchange rates from
Pounds 124m to Pounds 226m. But SmithKline's claim that its shingles drug
Famvir, launched in the UK in January, had won a 30 per cent market share
was disputed by Wellcome, maker of market leader Zovirax. It said Famvir had
only 15 per cent of the market.
Total sales were 8 per cent higher at Pounds 1.59bn, from Pounds 1.46bn,
with trading profit up a similar amount at Pounds 301m, against Pounds 277m.
Pre-tax profits were 2 per cent down from Pounds 291m to Pounds 285m. The
1993 quarter included an exceptional Pounds 14m gain.
Earnings per share were 4 per cent higher at 7.8p helped by a sharp fall in
the estimated full-year tax charge, from 30.7 per cent to 27.9 per cent,
partly as a result of tax breaks arising from the Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds
1.5bn) acquisition of US distributor Diversified Pharmaceutical Services in
May. The quarterly dividend is 3p per London-quoted A share and 30.16 cents
per New York-quoted equity unit ADR.
Of the company's four business areas, pharmaceuticals grew the slowest. The
3 per cent rise in revenues came entirely from volume gains. Trading profit
fell 2 per cent as a result of the lower contribution from Tagamet.
SmithKline's biggest seller, the antibiotic Augmentin, saw sales rise 7 per
cent to Pounds 160m. The fastest growth came from the new anti-depressant
Seroxat, called Paxil in the US, whose sales more than doubled to Pounds
87m.
Animal health sales rose 10 per cent thanks to anti-infective treatments.
Consumer healthcare, which includes non-medical products such as the soft
drinks Ribena and Lucozade, had a 9 per cent increase in sales. Sales from
clinical laboratories rose 5 per cent in spite of a decline in average
prices.
