  [Text] The Petroleum Energy Center is an institution 
founded in 1986 to carry out research on the use of petroleum 
energy. 
  Since its foundation, development of naphtha/kerosene 
utilization technology for fuel cell systems has been one of the 
main programs. 
  The program consists of three subprograms to develop PAFC, 
MCFC and SOFC systems using light petroleum fraction such as 
naphtha or kerosene as raw fuel. 
<H5>  1. Development of PAFC </H5>
<H5>  1.1 Development of Naphtha Utilization Technology for PAFC </H5>
  PEC conducted a technology development program in order to 
utilize light petroleum fraction such as naphtha as raw fuel for 
PAFC from 1986 through 1990. 
  Seven petroleum, one electric appliances manufacturer and 
one 
engineering/construction company participated in this program. 
  Main topics of the technology development are as follow: 
  (1) developed catalysts for hydrodesulfurization, partial 
cracking hydrodesulfurization and adsorbing desulfurization of 
naphtha and/or kerosene; 
  (2) developed noble metal based catalysts for reforming; 
  (3) demonstrated naphtha-fed PAFCs (50, 80, 100, 200kW). 
<H3>  1.2 Technology Development for Commercialization of 
Naphtha-fed PAFC </H3>
  Based on technologies developed in the above mentioned 
program, we are now practicing a 5-year technology development 
program for commercialization of petroleum-fed PAFCS. In this 
program, six petroleum companies participated and two fuel cell 
manufacturers cooperate with PEC. 
  We have manufactured two naphtha-fed commercial prototype 
PAFCs (50, 200kW). 
  The differences between these two prototypes are seen in the 
types of the reforming catalysts, reformer types, fuel cell 
itself and so on. 
  The sizes of the prototypes were chosen because these are 
generally used in cogeneration in the market. 
  The 50kW prototype started its operation in this past July 
and is now continuing stable and satisfactory operation. It is 
located in Chiba prefecture, in an ``aqua-house'' which has fair 
number of Japanese type public baths in the building. 
  Electricity and heat are used for their water heating. 
  The 200kW prototype is going to start in this October and it 
is located in the research facilities area of RITE (Research 
Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth) situated in 
Kansai Science City in Kyoto. This 200kW prototype is one of new 
energy facilities in RITE consisting of fuel cell solar energy 
and wind energy test facilities. 
  The main stress of this project is put on catalysts 
development and total fuel cell system engineering. 
  The reforming catalysts used in these prototypes are the 
ones 
developed by PEC in the preceding 5-year program and improved 
later on. Also for improving the compactness of the fuel cell 
packages, PEC has developed a new ejecter type naphtha 
vapourizer. 
  The items to be verified are: 
  (1) demonstrate the activity and life of the 
hydrodesulfurization catalysts and reforming catalysts; 
  (2) demonstrate the reliability of the fuel cell; 
  (3) for the total system, demonstrate reliability, operating 
flexibility, maintenance ease, economics and so on. 
<H3>  1.3 Technology Development for Commercialization of 
Kerosene-fed PAFC </H3>
  As a raw fuel for fuel cells, kerosene is much harder to 
desulfurize and reform and needs newly developed catalysts. 
  In a catalysts evaluating pilot plant in the Advanced 
Technology &amp; Research Institute which is an organization of 
PEC, 
several catalysts developed by PEC are being tested now to 
decide the best one to the kerosene-fed PAFC. 
  The 200kW kerosene-fed experimental prototype is now being 
manufactured and will start its operation in the above mentioned 
laboratory in late 1994. 
<H5>  2. Development of MCFC </H5>
<H3>  2.1 Development of Naphtha Utilization Technology for 
External Reforming MCFC </H3>
  PEC conducted a technology development program in order to 
utilize light petroleum fraction such as naphtha as raw fuel for 
External Reforming MCFC from 1986 through 1990. 
  One petroleum, one electric appliances manufacturer and one 
engineering/construction company participated in this program. 
  Summary of the technology development is as follows: 
  (1) developed reforming catalysts for MCFC; 
  (2) investigated effect of sulfur compounds and water 
included in reformed gas on fuel cell components; 
  (3) improved materials for wet seals and electrolytes; 
  (4) demonstrated a naphtha-fed External Reforming MCFC 
(10kW) 
attaining the target efficiency of 45&percnt;. 
<H3>  2.2 Development of Light Petroleum Fraction Utilization 
Technology for Internal Reforming MCFC </H3>
  PEC has been conducting a 5-year technology development 
program in order to utilize light petroleum fraction such as 
naphtha for internal reforming MCFC since 1990. 
  Two petroleum, one electric appliances manufacturer and one 
engineering/construction company have been taking part in this 
program. 
  Outline of the technology development is as follows: 
  (1) demonstrated 10kW direct internal reforming MCFC stack 
and test data are now checked against the design. The size is 
one of the biggest in the world; 
  (2) 30kW direct internal reforming MCFC system will be made 
in 1994 and a continuous run is planned; 
  (3) the mechanism of catalysts poisoning by molten carbonate 
has been studied and been minimized both from liquid phase and 
vapour phase. From this development, the single cell is 
continuing its run beyond 6,000 hours. 
<H5>  3. Development of SOFC </H5>
  PEC has been conducting a 5-year technology development 
program in order to utilize light petroleum fraction such as 
naphtha for SOFC since 1990. 
  Three petroleum companies have been taking part in this 
program. 
  Outline of the technology development is as follows: 
<H5>  1) Tubular SOFC System </H5>
  (1) Developed a thin layer electrode and electrolyte by 
plasma spray which is a method to give good possibility of large 
cost-down in the manufacturing of SOFC cell compared with the 
ECVD method. 
  (2) Developed a reforming catalyst which gives methane rich 
reformed gas. This reformed gas has an internal cooling effect 
in a fuel cell by its heat absorption in a reforming reaction to 
hydrogen and can improve the total heat efficiency by decreasing 
external cooling medium. 
<H5>  2) Planar SOFC System </H5>
  (1) Improved properties of electrolyte, electrode, and 
separater and thus demonstrated a 1.3kW stack at 50&percnt; fuel 
utilization, 0.2w/cm, 
  (2) Attained power density of 0.19w/cm at 5cm square single 
cell at 40&percnt; efficiency, 
  (3) A 10kW stack will be attained in 1994.
