TUNNELERS LINK BRITAIN, FRANCE UNDER CHANNEL 
British and French tunnelers reached each other beneath the waters of the 
English Channel on Tuesday for a linkup that ended Britain's geographical 
isolation from Europe. 
An official of Eurotunnel, the consortium building the Gargantuan rail project 
from the British end, said the two work teams connected at 7:30 p.m. in the 
drilling of a service tunnel. 
"Britain will no longer be an island," French Radio said. 
Earlier, a Eurotunnel spokeswoman said the British tunnelers had stopped their 
machine and inserted a 2.3-inch-wide steel pipe into the chalky soil a distance 
of 110 yards. 
The probe enabled engineers to confirm that the tunnel was heading in the right 
direction for the actual breakthrough. 
The significance of the event was not lost on British workers, who call 
themselves "the Tunnel Tigers." In reports they said the hole would be large 
enough for them to get a "whiff of garlic" from the French side. 
A formal linkup ceremony will take place in January, when British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand will meet 
at the midway point to shake hands and celebrate Britain's first physical link 
with the Continent. 
Rail traffic is scheduled to start rolling through the 31-mile link of two rail 
and one service tunnels in mid-1993. The $15-billion project began in January, 
1986.
