  [Excerpts] The international media has lately expressed 
concern over exploration activities in Vietnam's Changshas 
[Spratlys] and near Thanh Long (Blue Dragon) reef by China and 
the U.S. Crestone Corporation. Following are excerpts of 
comments carried by the international press over this issue: 
  In an article in the 6 May issue of the INTERNATIONAL HERALD 
TRIBUNE, Philip Bowring said the international media was 
astonished when, two years ago, the U.S. Crestone Energy 
Corporation announced that China had awarded it an exploration 
block in an area 250 kilometers southeast of Vietnam and 500 
kilometers from Malaysia, but 1,300 kilometers from China's 
Hainan Island. [passage omitted on the TRIBUNE report] 
  According to an ASSOCIATED PRESS report, U.S. lawyers and 
oceanography experts stated on 12 May that, Vietnam's 
reiteration of its territorial and sovereignty claims over the 
Changshas seems rational and understandable. [passage omitted on 
the ASSOCIATED PRESS report] 
  Writing in the March issue of the NATIONAL DEFENSE MAGAZINE, 
Navy Officer (Henry Labrook) said a check against the archives 
of the French Foreign Ministry will show that the Changshas are 
Vietnamese territory. [passage omitted on NATIONAL DEFENSE
