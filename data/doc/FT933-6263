FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: US tax returns incentive - At a
glance
US expatriates who have not filed their federal income tax returns, are
being given an incentive by the Internal Revenue Service to come clean.
Moore Stephens, the New York-based accountants, says that US citizens living
abroad can now exclude housing costs and up to Dollars 70,000 of
foreign-earned income from their gross income.
Previously, these exclusions could only be claimed on an income tax return
or an amendment filed within a limited period. Under the new rules, an
expatriate taxpayer can file returns which are years overdue and no time
limit is set for filing a return claiming the exclusions.
However, Moore Stephens warns that if expatriates owe federal income taxes
and are contacted by the IRS before filing their returns, they lose the tax
break.
