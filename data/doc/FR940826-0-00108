Responsibility for monitoring and training. 

(1) At least once every three years, HUD intends to conduct in-depth monitoring of the environmental activities performed
by recipients that have assumed responsibilities for environmental review, decisionmaking, and action under this
part. Limited monitoring of these environmental activities will be conducted during each program monitoring site
visit. If through limited or in-depth monitoring of these environmental activities or by other means, HUD becomes
aware of any environmental deficiencies, HUD may take one or more of the following actions: 
(i) In the case of problems found during limited monitoring, HUD may schedule in-depth monitoring at an earlier date
or may schedule in-depth monitoring more frequently; 
(ii) HUD may require attendance by recipient staff at HUD sponsored or approved training, which will be provided periodically
at various locations around the country; 
(iii) HUD may refuse to accept the certifications of environmental compliance on subsequent grants; 
(iv) HUD may suspend or terminate the recipient's assumption of the environmental review responsibility; 
(v) HUD may initiate sanctions, corrective actions or other remedies provided in program regulations or agreements
or contracts with the recipient. 
(2) HUD's responsibilities and action under paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not be construed to limit or reduce
any responsibility assumed by a recipient with respect to any particular release of funds under this part. Whether
or not HUD takes action under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Certifying Officer remains the responsible Federal
official under 58.17 with respect to projects and activities for which the Certifying Officer has submitted
a RROF and certification under this part.
