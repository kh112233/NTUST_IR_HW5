  [Text] Georgia's leader Eduard Shevardnadze has no 
objection to the possibility of ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia 
being buried in Tbilisi; but he is of the view that the Georgian 
people will be against it, Interfax learned today from a 
highly-placed official in Chechnya's foreign ministry who has 
been in the Georgian capital as part of a republican delegation. 
At meanwhile, an enquiry group from Georgia, which has arrived 
in the west of the republic, has not yet found any evidence to 
confirm allegations that Zviad Gamsakhurdia committed suicide or 
was murdered.
