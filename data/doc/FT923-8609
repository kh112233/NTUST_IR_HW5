FT  11 AUG 92 / Options for Czechs and Slovaks set out
THE head of the State Bank of Czechoslovakia says two currencies would be
possible if the Czech and Slovak republics become separate states, but the
states could also have one currency with the necessary financial and
budgetary co-ordination, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Josef Tosovsky said in an interview published yesterday in the Slovak
daily 'Smena' that the introduction of separate Czech and Slovak currencies
would have to be by 'legal means'.
'The change in state set-up is by a definite political decision, a political
move, which would be necessary to realise by a definite means in monetary
policy,' Mr Tosovsky said.
At the same time, Mr Tosovsky said that separate states with a joint
currency or an agreement for a monetary union would require a co-ordinated
financial and budgetary policy 'for such a close economic union'.
'Both partners would have to surrender their sovereignty roughly in the
sense that European states intend to surrender it in the framework of the
proposed monetary union,' Mr Tosovsky said.
'The agreements in Maastricht are in that regard inspirational.'
Czech and Slovak political leaders have ordered the parliaments of the two
republics to devise a plan for a new federal structure by September 30.
Economists say that a split in the currency, the koruna, is likely if
Czechoslovakia is divided in two, because of wide differences in the
economies of the two republics and the economic policies of their
governments.
