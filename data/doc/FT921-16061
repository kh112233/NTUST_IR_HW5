FT  07 JAN 92 / Technology: Shot in the arm boosts profits - How drug
companies are coming closer to developing an all-in-one vaccine
Vaccine production, for long a sleepy sideline of the pharmaceutical
industry, is being rejuvenated through a combination of new technology and
corporate restructuring.
With the help of biotechnology, researchers are developing vaccines for
diseases against which there is no protection today, from malaria to Aids.
At the same time they are working to combine existing vaccines and
ultimately achieve the World Health Organisation's goal of an 'ideal
children's vaccine' which would deliver immunity against all serious
childhood illnesses in a single dose shortly after birth.
The corporate background to vaccine development is changing as fast as the
science, through mergers and alliances which are transforming a patchwork of
national vaccine companies into a handful of global players.
The most important event was the Dollars 785m (Pounds 430m) takeover of
Connaught of Canada by Institut Merieux of France at the end of 1989. That
boosted Merieux's worldwide vaccine sales to Dollars 300m a year - well
ahead of its three leading competitors, Lederle (Cyanamid) and Merck of the
US, and SmithKline Beecham whose vaccine business is based in Belgium.
Together the top four companies account for half of the Dollars 1.3bn a year
world vaccines market.
Meanwhile the single-country vaccine companies are gradually selling out.
For example, Wellcome sold its century-old UK vaccine business to Medeva for
Pounds 20m at the beginning of this year, making Medeva the country's only
commercial vaccine producer.
The next moves on the world stage are likely to be strategic alliances
between the leading companies. Merieux and Merck recently signed a letter of
intent to co-operate on developing and marketing combined childhood vaccines
for the US market and they are waiting for the Federal Trade Commission to
approve the agreement.
'If we get the green light from the FTC, I'm convinced we will then go
further with Merck,' says Alain Merieux, chief executive of the French
company. And there is speculation in the pharmaceutical industry that
Lederle and SmithKline Beecham are planning a vaccines alliance to balance
the link-up between Merieux and Merck.
The primary reason for these alliances, according to Alain Merieux, is that
'the future lies in combined vaccines with multiple antigens'. (Antigens are
the proteins produced by viruses and bacteria which stimulate the immune
system to make protective antibodies.) No single company has enough antigens
to make a good all-in-one vaccine on its own.
Two triple childhood vaccines are already used routinely: DTP against
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough) and MMR against measles,
mumps and rubella. Jacques Armand, Merieux's vaccine development and
production director, says it will be feasible within two years to expand DTP
into a six-fold vaccine, by adding polio, hepatitis B and haemophilus
influenzae b (the latter is a relatively new vaccine which protects against
a common form of bacterial meningitis).
Researchers are developing methods for combining vaccines in a stable
mixture. 'If there is incompatibility between ingredients, we could use a
dual-barrelled syringe in which some ingredients are kept separate in two
compartments,' Armand adds.
A more serious obstacle to combining childhood vaccines is that the current
strains need to be given at different ages to provoke the best immune
response. It would be impossible for example to add the current measles
vaccine - given at 12 to 15 months - to DTP which is generally given in
three doses at two, three and four months. So the search is on for new
strains that will confer immunity soon after birth.
In the long run, the best hope for a multiple vaccine may lie in genetic
engineering. The favourite approach is to add antigen genes from several
different germs to a single 'Christmas tree' micro-organism. Most
researchers are using viruses of the pox family, which contain large amounts
of genetic material and are therefore attractive targets for genetic
manipulation. They also have a long history as vaccines; the successful WHO
campaign to eradicate smallpox was based on vaccination with cowpox
(vaccinia).
Merieux researchers have chosen canary pox, which normally infects birds, as
their already carried out clinical trials of a new rabies vaccine, made from
canary pox genetically engineered to incorporate rabies antigens.
Animal tests show that a genetically engineered pox vaccine can induce
immunity against several diseases, though the approach is unlikely to
produce a commercial human vaccine for several years. 'A few years ago this
was just a dream, now it's at least part of the way towards reality,' says
Armand.
Multiple vaccines will help the WHO and Unicef (the United Nations
Children's Fund) to achieve their goal of universal childhood vaccination.
Already 80 per cent of the world's children have been immunised against six
leading childhood diseases - measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus,
polio and tuberculosis - compared with only 10 per cent a decade ago. This
has required health workers to make five separate visits and administer
eight doses of vaccine to each child. Combining them into a one-shot vaccine
would bring operational advantages not only to hard-pressed health workers
in the third world but to parents in developed countries who sometimes lose
track of their children's vaccination schedule.
Although the first priority is to improve and combine existing vaccines,
'new vaccines are a close second priority,' says Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO
director-general. Only about 20 diseases have commercially available
vaccines. There are none yet for many diseases that cause widespread death,
including dengue, rotavirus diarrhoea, hepatitis A and E, acute respiratory
infections, meningococcal meningitis, malaria and Aids.
Charles Merieux, honorary chairman of Institut Merieux, believes Aids and
malaria are the two greatest challenges facing the industry. 'An Aids
vaccine is the most exciting scientific challenge and malaria is most
important for helping people,' he says. The worldwide effort to produce a
vaccine against malaria - which kills about 2m people a year, mostly African
children - will be successful within five years, Merieux believes.
Although genetic engineering plays a vital role in making new vaccines,
'there is still plenty of juice left in classical vaccine development,' says
Stanley Plotkin, Merieux medical and scientific director. 'All the different
approaches to an Aids vaccine depend on genetic engineering, but it doesn't
play much of a role in hepatitis A, for example.'
Non-genetic techniques will also improve existing vaccines. WHO is
particularly keen on micro-encapsulation, a new delivery system based on
tiny biodegradable capsules which release vaccine slowly into the
bloodstream in a way that mimics repeated injections.
In the industrialised world, a priority is to produce a new whooping cough
vaccine. The existing one is more likely to provoke damaging side-effects
than any other childhood vaccine. Manufacturers are therefore anxious to
replace the current vaccine, which is based on whole cells of the pertussis
bacteria, with an 'acellular' vaccine containing the most important
antigens.
Although an acellular pertussis vaccine is used routinely in Japan, western
health authorities do not like it because it cannot be administered until
the child is two years old. Large-scale field trials of acellular vaccines
suitable for babies are expected to start in Sweden this year.
