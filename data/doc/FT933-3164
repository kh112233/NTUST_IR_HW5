FT  15 SEP 93 / Rexrodt abandons peace role in Volkswagen row with GM
MR Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, has unexpectedly abandoned his
role as peacemaker between motor industry rivals Volkswagen and Adam Opel,
the German subsidiary of General Motors.
He was being kept informed on the bitter dispute over the alleged theft of
data and possible industrial espionage by Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, the new VW production director. But the minister was 'no longer
active', a spokeswoman said yesterday.
'Nothing has changed, and when there is no willingness, then it is just a
waste of time,' she added. It is understood there are no plans for any
further contacts with either side.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, Mr Rexrodt's personal spokesman, said recently that the
minister's aim had been to try to prevent damage to political and business
relations between the US and Germany and to find a way for the two companies
'to work together sensibly'.
Political observers said yesterday that, by leaving the legal investigation
and the row to run their natural courses, Mr Rexrodt has withdrawn from an
fast-moving, unpredictable situation in which he was ill-advised to
intervene in the first place.
He was drawn into the fray by Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, after Opel
said it would agree to written exchanges with the VW chief if he publicly
retracted statements that the US group was conducting a 'war' with the
intention of 'defaming' Volkswagen.
However, Mr Piech was prepared only to offer not to repeat his accusations.
The minister last met Mr David Herman, Opel chairman, on August 26 in
Frankfurt, the same day public prosecutors raided and searched VW
headquarters and the homes of Mr Lopez and seven of his colleagues. Since
then there has been no further contact.
