FT  10 SEP 93 / Argentine journalist beaten
Mr Ernan Lopez Echague, a journalist on Argentina's opposition newspaper
Pagina/12, has been attacked for the second time in two weeks, in an
apparent wave of attempts to intimidate journalists, John Barham reports
from Buenos Aires.
Mr Lopez Echague was picked up early on Thursday by a group of assailants,
bundled into an unmarked car and taken to empty land, where he was beaten
unconscious.
Last month two men beat him and cut his face with a switchblade, cursing him
for investigating allegations that the ruling Peronist party uses hired
thugs as 'security guards' at rallies to prevent heckling.
