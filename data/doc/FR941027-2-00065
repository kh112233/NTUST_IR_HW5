SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On June 26, 1992, Ciba Corning Diagnostics Corp., Medfield, MA 020521688, submitted to CDRH an application
for premarket approval of ASC

TM

 PSA +D. The device is a two-site chemiluminometric assay and is indicated for the quantitative, serial determination
of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in serum and to aid in the management of patients with prostate cancer using the
Ciba Corning Automated Chemiluminescence System (ACS). In accordance with the provisions of section 515(c)(2)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(c)(2)) as amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, this PMA was not referred to the
Immunology Devices Panel, an FDA advisory panel, for review and recommendation because the information in the PMA
substantially duplicates information previously reviewed by this panel. On September 2, 1994, CDRH approved the
application by a letter to the applicant from the Director of the Office of Device Evaluation, CDRH.


A summary of the safety and effectiveness data on which CDRH based its approval is on file in the Dockets Management
Branch (address above) and is available from that office upon written request. Requests should be identified with
the name of the device and the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.


Opportunity for Administrative Review 


Section 515(d)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(d)(3)) authorizes any interested person to petition, under section
515(g) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(g)), for administrative review of CDRH's decision to approve this application.
A petitioner may request either a formal hearing under part 12 (21 CFR part 12) of FDA's administrative practices and
procedures regulations or a review of the application and CDRH's action by an independent advisory committee of experts.
A petition is to be in the form of a petition for reconsideration under 10.33(b) (21 CFR 10.33(b)). A petitioner
shall identify the form of review requested (hearing or independent advisory committee) and shall submit with the
petition supporting data and information showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of material fact for
resolution through administrative review. After reviewing the petition, FDA will decide whether to grant or deny
the petition and will publish a notice of its decision in the 

Federal Register

. If FDA grants the petition, the notice will state the issue to be reviewed, the form of review to be used, the persons
who may participate in the review, the time and place where the review will occur, and other details.
Petitioners may, at any time on or before November 28, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above)
two copies of each petition and supporting data and information, identified with the name of the device and the docket
number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received petitions may be seen in the office above between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
This notice is issued under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (secs. 515(d), 520(h) (21 U.S.C. 360e(d), 360j(h)))

and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Director,
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (21 CFR 5.53).
