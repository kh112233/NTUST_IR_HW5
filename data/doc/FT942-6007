FT  02 JUN 94 / General's killing blamed on Eta
A Spanish general was shot dead outside his home in central Madrid yesterday
in an attack suspected to have been carried out by the Basque separatist
organisation, Eta. The defence minister, Mr Julian Garcia Vargas, said the
shooting confirmed his 'worst fear' that Eta has a well organised unit
operating in Madrid. General Juan Jose Hernandez Rovira, 58, a widower and
the father of six children, held a senior administrative post in the Defence
Ministry and had responsibility for general services and supplies to the
Spanish forces.
