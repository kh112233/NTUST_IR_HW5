FT  31 JUL 92 / Textile and car strikes hit Mexico
MEXICO is facing its most serious industrial trouble for more than a year,
with some 16,000 workers at the Volkswagen car plant and 22,000 textile
workers on strike.
The strike has been costing Volkswagen, the leading car-maker for the
Mexican market, about Dollars 5m a day. Workers walked out on July 21 after
discovering union leaders had secretly agreed to accept Japanese-style
working methods in the factory.
The strike by cotton textile workers is over pay and working conditions.
Their union called the strike on July 9, after employers' representatives
had refused to offer more than a 10 per cent wage increase, and wanted to
eliminate a rigid system of work shifts.
