  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Jan (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
announced today that Argentina will remove the mines left in the 
Malvinas Islands after the past South Atlantic war, but the UK 
will pay for the work. 
  The president made these remarks the same day that Vice 
Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella announced that negotiations 
instrumental to the mines' removal "might begin after the 
islands' council informs the UK Government" of the Argentine 
proposal. 
  The announcement that the Argentine Government had made an 
offer to the United Kingdom to sweep the mines left in the 
archipelago after the 1982 war caused a strong controversy with 
regard to who would finance the operation. 
  Menem said today: "It has been established that Argentina 
will remove the mines, but the UK will pay for it." During a 
casual chat with journalists accredited to Government House, he 
added: "The work might cost about $5 million."
