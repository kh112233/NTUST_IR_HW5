<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with General Martin Balza, the Army </F>
chief of staff, by Laura Luz Ojeda in Mar del Plata "before 
leaving for Croatia"] 
  [Text] [Ojeda] What is the Army's current situation? 
  [Balza] It is a motivated Army that has much faith in the 
future, but is dynamically working in the present and complying 
with this year's projections. For example, now we are 
conducting courses in the training and advanced studies 
institutes, preparing the groups that will replace our men in 
Croatia, Cyprus, and Kuwait. I believe that I view the Army the 
way in which the society to which we belong and serve views it. 
  [Ojeda] What is the Army's relationship with the current 
government? 
  [Balza] It is the proper relationship for an armed force 
with the authorities it must serve. It is a relationship of 
total subordination, within a framework of respect and much 
understanding. 
  [Ojeda] Do you agree with the budget allocated to you? 
  [Balza] This is a confidential issue that I discuss 
exclusively with the defense minister. I may actually say that 
we already are working under the 1994 budget and that there has 
been an increase that allows us to view the tasks scheduled for 
this year with much optimism. 
  [Ojeda] Are you not viewing a progressive shrinking in 
recent times as far as Army personnel are concerned? 
  [Balza] I am absolutely not viewing a shrinking Army. Quite 
the contrary, I view an Army in which quality prevails over 
quantity and training prevails over weakness. It is a trained 
and motivated Army, with great experience, an Army in which our 
men, who are carrying out peace missions, are being greatly 
enriched both technically and culturally. 
  [Ojeda] What is your armament level? 
  [Balza] We have enough weapons to train ourselves. More 
detailed points on this issue are already confidential. 
  [Ojeda] What is your opinion of the fact that Argentine 
forces will have to remove the mines in the Malvinas Islands? 
  [Balza] The information I have is that supplied by the 
media. We have not received any orders in this regard and the 
defense minister was very clear on this point. 
  [Ojeda] Will military service remain compulsory? 
  [Balza] This is a political decision. It is society, 
through its legislators, that will determine this. Neither the 
Armed Forces nor the Army will determine this. If a volunteer 
system is implemented, many things would have to be changed, but 
thus far our legislators have not contemplated the possibility 
of abolishing the conscription system. 
  [Ojeda] In your opinion, should it or shouldn't it be 
compulsory? 
  [Balza] All NATO countries, with the exception of the United 
Kingdom and some other principalities, have compulsory military 
service. The same applies for the former Warsaw Pact countries 
and American countries, with the exception of the United States, 
Canada, and Uruguay. Therefore, this system has been chosen 
almost everywhere in the world. 
  [Ojeda] What is your opinion of Scotland Yard and the 
investigation it has conducted in our country? 
  [Balza] This issue is not linked to the Army. If the 
British authorities believe that any of their soldiers violated 
the Geneva Convention, they must conduct the investigations they 
deem appropriate, but this issue does not involve us. 
  [Ojeda] When will the replacement be implemented in Croatia? 
  [Balza] In late February. I will leave on 19 January to 
visit the troops there, the new positions, and the two seriously 
wounded men we have there in order to decorate them in the name 
of the Army. Afterward, I plan on briefly visiting the men who 
are building roads in Kuwait. I would like to emphasize that 
all of us Argentines should feel proud of the conduct of our 
men-at-arms who are carrying out missions abroad in UN 
organizations, helping world peace.
