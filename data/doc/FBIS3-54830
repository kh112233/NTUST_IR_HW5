  [Text] Tallinn, Dec 30, BNS -- A year ago 30,431 
businesses (institutions, public organizations and farms 
excluded) were registered in Estonia. Their number had grown to 
36,900 by last June and to 41,820 by November, the Economics 
Ministry reports in its 1993-1994 economic survey. 
  Some 10,000-12,000 new businesses will be established next 
year, economists predict, provided the regulations are not 
substantially changed. 
  The level of enterprise was the highest in the Tallinn area 
with 43 businesses per 1,000 people and the lowest in East 
Virumaa, where 12 businesses per 1,000 people were registered. 
Tallinn and Saaremaa showed the biggest increase in the number 
of registered companies, about seven enterprises per 1,000 
people in six months. 
  Experts estimate there will be over 40,000 unemployed and 
78,000 job seekers in Estonia early next year. They predict the 
growth of unemployment will stop in the second half of next 
year. Forecasts put the number of people employed in the 
Estonian economy next year at 600,000-650,000. 
  Personal income, according to revenues from personal income 
tax, is the biggest in northwest Estonia -- over 700 kroons, and 
the lowest in southeast Estonia, where it remains below 400 
kroons.
