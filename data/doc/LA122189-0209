NATION; 
LEONA REJECTS PLEA BARGAIN 
Hotel queen Leona Helmsley, already sentenced to four years in a federal 
prison, rejected an offer for a concurrent sentence in her state tax fraud case 
today, insisting, "I've committed no crime. I'm not giving up." 
Sitting stiffly at the defense table in state Supreme Court, Helmsley listened 
silently as her lawyer, Gerald Feffer, turned down a plea bargain offered by 
the state attorney general's office.
