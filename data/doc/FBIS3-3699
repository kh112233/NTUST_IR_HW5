  [Text] Lhasa, March 19 (XINHUA) -- A massive geological 
survey since 1986 has resulted in the finding of 130 new mineral 
deposits, including copper, lead, zinc, silver, gold, mercury 
and other important minerals, in the Tibetan Autonomous Region, 
official sources here said. 
  The sources noted that geologists have worked out a 27-part 
mineral distribution map on a 1:200,000 scale, covering 193,200 
square km, about 16 percent of the total area of Tibet. 
  New discoveries include the finding of gold, silver, copper, 
lead, zinc and other metals from volcanoes near Samyai temple, 
in Chanang county. 
  Explorers also found a large andalusite deposit at Ramba 
town 
of Rinbung county, the sources said. 
  The explorers have also carried out a detailed survey of the 
chromium in Qusum county, the gold in Xaitongmoin county, the 
multi-metal sources in Maizhokunggar county and the geothermal 
potential at Yangbajain in Damxung county. 
  Moreover, the explorers found that the many salt lakes in 
Tibet contain not only boron, but also lithium, tin, cesium and 
other valuable minerals. 
  In a survey of the Yangbajain geothermal area 90 km from 
Lhasa last year, explorers found that there is a layer of water 
at 262 degrees celsius at a depth of 2,006 meters. This was 
cited as another important breakthrough following the discovery 
of a 202 degrees celsius water layer at 1,000 m deep in 1989. 
  According to the sources, Tibet has built in recent years 
120 
new mines, including 28 chromium-iron mines, 11 boron mines and 
seven gold mines. 
  The output value of mining now accounts for more than one 
third of the industrial output value of the Tibetan Autonomous 
Region, the sources added.
