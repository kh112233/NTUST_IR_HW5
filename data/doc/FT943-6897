FT  26 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Picking out the crop pests
Insecticide sprays often indiscriminately destroy both pests and useful
organisms. Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Polymer
Research in Teltow, Germany, believe they have found a way to target pests
more effectively by enclosing the insecticide in a degradable microcapsule.
The capsules, which attach themselves to the leaves of crops, are eaten by
the pests. Less insecticide is needed than with current techniques, spraying
is less frequent and there is reduced risk that toxic agents are washed into
the soil by rain. The system also avoids use of toxic solvents, often added
to insecticides to improve spraying qualities.
