WRONG-WAY DRIVER, 76, KILLED IN FREEWAY CRASH 
A wrong-way driver was fatally injured on the Orange Freeway just north of 
Katella Avenue about 4:10 p.m. Sunday when his northbound car plowed head-on 
into a southbound pickup truck, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
The wrong-way driver was identified by the county coroner's office as Edward 
Phillips, 76, of Laguna Hills, who was pronounced dead at the scene. 
The driver of the pickup was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange with 
"moderate injuries," said the CHP, which identified him only as a 48-year-old 
Placentia man. 
Authorities said the Phillips car became northbound in the southbound lanes. 
The CHP said investigators could not determine why or how the car got into the 
flow against traffic. 
"Several people (driving on the freeway) said they had to take evasive action 
to avoid being hit by him," a CHP dispatcher said.
