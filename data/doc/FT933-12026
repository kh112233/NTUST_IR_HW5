FT  27 JUL 93 / Pounds 3.5m paid on life insurance
ADMINISTRATORS of Maxwell companies and Mirror Group Newspapers have been
paid Pounds 3.5m by a group of insurance companies in an out-of-court
settlement over a policy on the life of the late Robert Maxwell. This is the
uncontested part of a Pounds 6.5m settlement sought by the administrators
and Mirror Group Newspapers from Robert Maxwell's insurers.
It emerged yesterday that the payment was made two weeks ago and is being
held by lawyers acting for the administrators and MGN while discussions
continue on how the money will be divided. It is thought that only a small
proportion will find its way to pensioners.
This is in part because the administrators, Price Waterhouse and Arthur
Andersen, have decided to set part of the Pounds 3.5m aside in a 'fighting
fund' to finance legal action against the insurance companies that refused
to participate in the compromise.
These companies suspect that Robert Maxwell committed suicide.
Administrators hope that the threat of legal action may be sufficient to
bring the companies into line, but lawyers acting for them made it clear
that their clients were prepared to go to court over the issue.
Legal action is bound to revive controversy about the circumstances of
Robert Maxwell's death. Under the conditions of his policy, drawn up several
years ago but last renewed in April 1991, the full claim would be payable
only if he died from accidental causes or murder.
