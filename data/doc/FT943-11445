FT  30 JUL 94 / Bomb blast in Madrid
General Francisco Veguillas, who as director-general of defence policy
played a key role in the modernisation of Spain's armed forces, was killed
yesterday, together with his driver, when a car bomb exploded alongside his
car. The blast, in central Madrid, also killed a bystander and severely
wounded at least eight others. The attack, which bore the hallmark of ETA,
the Basque separatist organisation, came in the midst of a controversial
initiative by the new interior and justice minister Mr Juan Alberto Belloch
to allow partial freedom to an initial 30 out of more than 500 jailed ETA
members serving long sentences. Gen Veguillas, 69, replaced Admiral Fausto
Escrigas, who was also killed by ETA, as director general of defence policy,
in 1985. Yesterday's attack brought the number of ETA victims this year to
nine, five of them military officers.
