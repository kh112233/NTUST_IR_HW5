DARYL GATES' COMMENTS ON DRUG USERS 
Studies have repeatedly shown that the consumption and production of marijuana 
in the United States is on the decrease, and that criminalization costs society 
more in terms of increased law-enforcement-related costs and deprived revenues 
from taxes on pot than legalization would. 
The dangers of marijuana are fewer than such legal substances as tobacco and 
alcohol, and any crime and violence connected to it is a direct result of its 
criminalization. 
If it were not for demagogic political grandstanding of the "war on drugs" ilk, 
it would have been legal long ago. 
Meanwhile, our country's real drug problems grow unabated. Our current problems 
of drug-related crime, violence, deaths, disease and birth defects are 
primarily fueled by cocaine and crack, and to a lesser extent (as the number of 
addicts to those substances are lower than cocaine and crack) heroin and 
methamphetamine.
