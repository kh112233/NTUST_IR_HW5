  [Text] At 1100 on 29 April, Sukhum Ratsamithat, director 
general of the Foreign Ministry's Economic Affairs Department, 
presided over the signing of an agreement at the Foreign 
Ministry under which China joined the Association of Tin 
Producing Countries. Chinese Ambassador to Thailand Jin Guihua 
signed the agreement establishing the Association of Tin 
Producing Countries on behalf of the Chinese Government. Also 
present at the signing ceremony were Indonesian and Malaysian 
representatives and officials from the Mineral Resources 
Department and the Foreign Ministry. 
  The signing ceremony took place in Thailand because the Thai 
Foreign Ministry is the depository of the agreement. The 
Association's membership increases from seven to eight with 
China's accession. The other seven members of the Association 
are Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Zaire, and 
Thailand. All of these countries have joined the Association 
since 1983. 
  The Foreign Ministry pointed out that it is good that China 
has joined the Association. Previously, China was only an 
observer of the Association even though it is the largest tin 
producer. China's membership will strengthen the Association's 
position and bargaining power in talks with tin consuming 
countries to solve problems with tin oversupply and falling tin 
prices jointly. 
  The establishment of the Association of Tin Producing 
Countries was aimed at ensuring fair tin prices and supplies and 
enhancing cooperation in tin marketing and tin resources 
research and development. 
  The Association also agreed upon three conditions for China 
to join the Association: 
  1. China will report its tin exports to the Association 
every quarter. 
  2. China will pay a membership fee in proportion to its 
tin exports. 
  3. China will temporarily not be invited to join the 
International Tin Research Association.
