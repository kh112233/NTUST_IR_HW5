FT  10 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Software group steps up action against
theft
ABOUT 37 companies in 10 European countries face legal action as the
Business Software Alliance steps up its campaign against software theft.
The companies include AMS Industries, a subsidiary of Siemens of Germany
based in the UK, Renfe, the Spanish state-owned railroad group, Docks de
France, Maison de la Geographie and Dargaud Editeur in France, and the Falck
Steel Company in Italy.
The BSA is an organisation representing the world's leading personal
computer software companies, including Microsoft, Lotus and Aldus. It has
brought a total of 150 actions against companies in Europe suspected of
copying software illegally.
The BSA typically collects evidence of piracy before seeking court orders to
enter the premises of suspect companies to seize counterfeit software.
Mr Bradford Smith, the BSA's European counsel, said the latest action was an
indication of the pace of activity that could be expected after January 1,
when an EC directive outlawing software piracy comes into force.
Worldwide, piracy is reckoned to be costing software producers between
Dollars 10bn and Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.1bn) in lost revenue, with EC and
Efta countries accounting for 46 per cent of the total.
The UK leads Europe in legal software with about 70 per cent of software
legally obtained, according to the BSA, while only about 20 per cent of the
software used in Italy and Spain is legal.
Mr Smith said BSA's concern over the wording of the UK's intended
legislation to implement the EC directive on piracy had largely been
resolved.
There had been fears that ambiguity in the wording might lead to confusion
when cases came to court. He said, however, there were still a few areas
where the Commission might take issue with the proposed UK law.
