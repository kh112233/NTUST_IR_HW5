FT  24 AUG 93 / Brazilians use the Beetle for trip into past
THE FILM Back to the Future relied on an out-dated De Lorean sports car for
its trips through time, but Brazil yesterday started its own journey into
the past with the relaunch of the Volkswagen Beetle, out of production since
1986.
The relaunch followed agreement in February between President Itamar Franco
and Autolatina, the joint venture between Volkswagen and Ford which is
Brazil's biggest vehicle maker.
The president wanted lower-priced, 'popular' cars, while Autolatina saw the
chance for a publicity coup and a way to extract tax concessions from the
government.
The car was launched at a ceremony yesterday in Autolatina's largest
Brazilian factory in Sao Paulo. It was attended by the president, several
ministers and Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, Volkswagen's director of
production.
The Beetle's popularity in Brazil is partly sentimental. It was the first
car to become affordable to the middle classes in the 1960s. It can also
handle the country's battered roads and is easy to repair.
The 'Fusca', as the Beetle is known in Brazil, has a newly-installed
catalytic converter and electronic ignition. Otherwise it is almost
identical to the old model which ceased production seven years ago.
The relaunch has fired mixed emotions. Some businessmen have dismissed it as
an unwelcome irrelevance when the Brazilian car industry is trying to
upgrade.
The industry, which includes Fiat and General Motors, is expected this year
to regain from Mexico its position at the top of the Latin American league.
Autolatina's unions are sceptical of the relaunch, even though it will
create about 8,000 jobs. They claim Autolatina's total investment of Dollars
30m (Pounds 20m) is small and the car's estimated sale price of Dollars
7,200 puts it out of reach of most Brazilians.
One union leader even grumbled that, given the money, he would rather buy a
Gol, another of Volkswagen's Brazilian models.
