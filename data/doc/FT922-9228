FT  08 MAY 92 / Third World Environmental Fund to have wider role
THE Global Environmental Facility, the fund administered by the UN and the
World Bank to help developing countries protect the environment, is to be
restructured so as to give it a wider role, writes David Lascelles,
Resources Editor.
The facility, set up as a three-year experiment in 1990, is to be given a
more enduring status, after decisions at the World Bank meeting in
Washington last week.
It is to be altered in two main ways. Governance of the GEF is to be made
more democratic by opening it to universal membership.
At present, its policies are dominated by the wealthy countries which
provide most of the money, and by its World Bank administrators.
A new Participants' Assembly would be created.
The facility will also be offered as a channel to fund projects under two
conventions being negotiated for the Earth Summit next month in Rio de
Janeiro.
