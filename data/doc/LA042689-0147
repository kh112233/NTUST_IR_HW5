U.S. SCIENTISTS TO BE SHOWN FUSION TESTS 
Two researchers who say they have mastered fusion, the process that powers the 
sun and the stars, told Congress today that they will duplicate their 
experiments for government scientists in hopes of quieting skeptics. 
"We have 19 experiments being set up now," University of Utah chemist Stanley 
Pons told the House Science Committee, including a demonstration of 
room-temperature fusion for scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
Pons said the federal scientists will monitor the experiment in Utah, then 
dismantle it and take it to the national laboratory in New Mexico for further 
tests. 
Silence Skepticism 
Pons and his collaborator, Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton 
in England, are making the arrangement to silence some of the skepticism about 
their claim to have discovered a way to achieve fusion using ordinary lab 
equipment assembled on a table top. 
The two announced their discovery March 23, stunning nuclear physicists around 
the world who have attempted to achieve fusion for 25 years using 
multimillion-dollar machines. 
The hearing was jammed with journalists, scientists and industrial 
representatives eager to learn more about a reaction that some predict could 
produce plentiful electric power with little environmental pollution or threat. 
Gave Off Heat 
Pons told the committee how he and Fleischmann had inserted electrodes of 
platinum and palladium in a flask containing deuterium oxide, or heavy water. 
Electrical current was applied to the platinum electrode, Pons said, forcing 
deuterium atoms into the crystal lattice of the palladium. 
He said that after the experiment ran for several hours, the deuterium became 
compressed and fused.
