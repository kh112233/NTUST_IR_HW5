FT  15 OCT 94 / Israelis seal town in search for kidnapped soldier
The Israeli defence force was refusing last night to confirm reports that
19-year-old Corporal Nachshon Waxman, the Israeli soldier facing a death
threat from the extremist Islamic Hamas movement, had been found alive in
the town of Ramallah on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israeli forces had
nevertheless sealed off the town.
As Israel and the Palestinian Palestine Liberation Organisation struggled to
save the Middle East peace process from collapse, the crisis overshadowed
the award of the Nobel peace prize yesterday to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's
prime minister, Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat,
PLO chairman.
Hamas had said it would kill Corp Waxman unless Israel released Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, and 200 other Palestinian prisoners.
As the deadline was due to expire last night, an emergency session of the
Israeli cabinet ruled out meeting the kidnappers' demands and rejected a
dialogue with the Islamic fundamentalists.
However, Hamas later said it would extend the deadline by 24 hours,
following an Israeli offer, delivered secretly by a member of the Knesset.
Mr Arafat, under intense pressure from Israel and the US to secure the
release of the soldier, ordered the arrest of more Hamas members in the Gaza
Strip. Palestinian officials said more than 200 Islamic activists were being
held yesterday.
Israel has chosen to make the safe release of Corp Waxman a test of Mr
Arafat's ability to increase security for Israelis. Mr Rabin has said Mr
Arafat must make 'a strategic choice' between continuing the peace process
and dealing with Hamas.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, echoed Israel's demands in a
meeting with Mr Arafat in Egypt yesterday. Mr Christopher said he had told
the PLO leader to 'confront the reign of terror imposed by Hamas'.
Hamas, outraged at the widescale arrests of its activists, has also said
that Mr Arafat must choose between Hamas and the peace process. Mr Mahmoud
Zohar, a leading Hamas activist in Gaza, warned Mr Arafat would 'have to
suffer the consequences' if he continued his clampdown. 'Preserving
Palestinian peace is better than preserving peace with Israel,' he said.
Mr Arafat's aides have cautioned Israel and the international community
against making demands for a direct confrontation with Hamas, saying the
peace deal is still too fragile and the benefits too limited to guarantee
that the pro-peace forces would win against a strong and organised
opposition.
The controversial award of the Nobel peace prize to Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin
was expected after being leaked earlier this week in a newspaper in Oslo.
But it was not widely anticipated that Mr Peres would also be named. It is
the first time the peace prize has gone to more than two recipients.
