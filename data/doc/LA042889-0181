P. M. BRIEFING; 
IMPORT BAN URGED ON LEG-TRAP FURS 
The European Community's Executive Commission today proposed banning the import 
of furs from animals caught in leg-hold traps. 
The measure would ban imports of furs or fur products originating "in a country 
where the leg-hold trap is still used or where the trapping methods used for 
the listed species do not meet internationally agreed humane trapping 
standards," the commission said. Listed species included beaver, otter, coyote, 
wolf, lynx, bobcat, sable and raccoon. 
The leg-hold trap has been banned in more than 60 countries -- but not in 
Canada, the United States or the Soviet Union.
