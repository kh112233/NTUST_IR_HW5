Jim Bakken, former kicker for the St. Louis Cardinal football team, has been 
given 3 years' probation on his guilty plea to charges of failing to pay enough 
tax on income from an investment club in 1980. 
Bakken, now vice president of marketing for Cass Bank &amp; Trust Co. in St. 
Louis, played for the Cardinals, who since have moved to Phoenix, from 
1962-1978. 
Authorities say the pyramid investment club was an illegal get-rich-quick 
scheme that flourished in Missouri in the early 1980s. The IRS reported in 1984 
that about 465 taxpayers made money in the scheme and that more than $2.6 
million in taxes, penalties and interest were underpaid.
