  [Text] Prague, Dec 13 (CTK) -- A total of 492 tanks, 499 
armored cars, 621 guns, and 25 combat aircraft have been 
destroyed during the first stage of the implementation of the 
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, the Defense Ministry 
Press Office told CTK today. 
  This list includes the relative part of equipment (100 
tanks, 
52 armored cars, 131 guns, and 4 combat aircraft) destroyed 
prior to December 31, 1992, in the former Federal (Czechoslovak) 
Army. 
  According to the timetable of the former Czechoslovak Army, 
the decrease in equipment and arms was divided into three 
periods: (I) July 17, 1992 to November 13, 1993, (II) November 
14, 1993, to November 13, 1994, and (III) November 14, 1994, to 
November 13, 1995. By the latter date, the stipulated levels 
are to be achieved. 
  In addition to the decrease in equipment and arms, the Czech 
Army has conducted this year eight inspections of superfluous 
equipment and arms in Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the 
Netherlands, Great Britain, and U.S. Army facilities in Germany. 
  Altogether 13 inspections, focused on the proper 
technological implementation of the destruction of superfluous 
military equipment and technology as well as on checking the 
quantity of the destroyed arms, were conducted by Czech Army 
officials in Hungary, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Italy, 
Romania, and Greece. 
  At the same time, eight inspections of specified places and 
67 inspections supervising the liquidation of superfluous arms 
were carried out in the Czech Republic. Inspection teams from 
Canada, Hungary, Portugal, Romania, and Great Britain were 
involved in them. 
  The Czech Army's superfluous arms and technology is stored 
in 
Holysov, west Bohemia, Jihlava, south Moravia, Felbabka, central 
Bohemia, Libava, north Moravia, Jaromer, east Bohemia and 
Terezin, central Bohemia. 
  The CFE, signed in Paris in 1990, has stipulated a maximum 
level of 957 tanks, 1,367 armored cars, 767 guns, 230 combat 
aircraft, and 50 combat helicopters for the Czech Republic.
