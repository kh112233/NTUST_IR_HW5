HEALTH; 
LYME DISEASE TRACED TO 1940S 
Tests on ticks collected in the 1940s indicate Lyme disease plagued the United 
States three decades earlier than previously thought and may have originated on 
Long Island, researchers said today. 
Analyzing the bodies of 136 ticks preserved in alcohol in the Museum of 
Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Mass., and the Smithsonian Institution in 
Washington, researchers found evidence of the microbe that causes Lyme disease 
in some ticks that roamed eastern Long Island 44 years ago. 
Lyme disease was not recognized as a distinct illness in the United States 
until 1975, when patients were first diagnosed in Lyme, Conn. 
More than 14,000 cases of Lyme disease have been reported in 43 states since 
1980, with most cases occurring in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic coastal 
states and Wisconsin, Minnesota, California and Oregon. 
The first symptoms usually are a distinctive rash at the tick bite site and 
flu-like symptoms. The disease can usually be treated with antibiotics. But 
without treatment, complications such as chronic arthritis, neurological and 
organ damage can occur.
