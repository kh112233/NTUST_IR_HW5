OLYMPIC GRANTS ELUDE NEEDIER AREAS IN O.C.; 
FUNDING: THE SURPLUS FROM THE GAMES SO FAR HAS GONE TO TWO AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES 
-- LAGUNA NIGUEL AND NEWPORT BEACH -- FOR A DIVING PLATFORM AND BOATS. 
The 1984 Summer Olympics left a rich legacy: $90 million in profit to be used 
for amateur youth sports in Southern California. 
But of the $30 million distributed so far, Orange County-based programs have 
received about 1% -- and nearly half of that went to buy a diving platform for 
a Laguna Niguel swimming pool and boats for a private Newport Beach rowing 
program. 
The guidelines of the nonprofit, tax-exempt Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los 
Angeles, which distributes the Olympic largess, stress that "special emphasis" 
be given to "groups or communities that are most in need. These will often be 
communities of lower income." 
Nevertheless, the programs in Newport Beach and Laguna Niguel, two of Southern 
California's most well-to-do communities, received $165,000 of the $336,000 
given to Orange County organizations since the grant program began five years 
ago. 
Meanwhile, needy amateur sports groups in Orange County, which hosted four 1984 
Olympic events, suffer from shortages of equipment, inadequate facilities and 
bank accounts in the red. Many of these groups apparently have been unaware 
that there is money available for the asking. Ironically, some may not qualify 
under AAF guidelines simply because they are too needy. 
Moreover, successful foundation grantsmanship may not hinge entirely on need. 
Connections seem to help. 
Consider: 
The private Newport Aquatic Center, where lessons cost $50 and it costs $250 a 
year to join, received a $115,000 grant in December, 1986, to buy 15 racing 
shells. Among the center's board of directors when it applied for the money 
were two former U.S. Olympic rowers -- Bruce Ibbetson and Curt Fleming -- and 
an ex-Olympic rowing coach -- David Grant. Ibbetson wrote the application for 
the grant. 
"The fact we were all on the Olympic team didn't hurt," conceded Grant, 
longtime Orange Coast College crew coach who last month was named the community 
college's president. 
The Crown Valley Recreation Center in Laguna Niguel was awarded $50,000 in 
October, 1989, to buy a diving platform and a water bubbler that will benefit a 
competitive diving team that practices at the public pool. The grant 
application was written by Dick Wilson, who was competition director for diving 
at the 1984 Summer Olympics and also the official announcer at those Olympic 
events. Wilson said his Olympics involvement made him aware of the grant 
program. 
"The fact that I'm aware of what the grant will do, that gave me an edge," 
Wilson said. "I did the (application) up right . . . to show how there was such 
a need." 
For example, without the expensive new diving platform, Wilson pointed out, the 
Crown Valley Divers would have to travel to Mission Viejo or Irvine to practice 
on a diving platform. 
"It's quite a long drive," said Wilson, whose wife, Ida, is the Crown Valley 
Divers' coach. 
The AAF says it considers grants for "any bona fide organization devoted to 
amateur sport," adding that its money is "aimed primarily to youth who are not 
at elite levels of sport accomplishment." 
Nevertheless, foundation officials concede that there is some advantage for 
applicants who have been affiliated with the Olympics. 
"I would assume people affiliated with the Olympics would get first choice," 
foundation chairman David Wolper said. "If somebody was an Olympic coach, he 
would be very high on our listing and should be." 
At stake is a seemingly endless supply of Olympic profits. By investing its 
money, the AAF has been able to give away and spend about $30 million just by 
drawing on interest and without touching the original $90 million allotted for 
Southern California. 
Curiously, demand for the money has been less than expected. 
"We haven't been overwhelmed with requests for money," said Los Angeles 
attorney John C. Argue, a member of the AAF board of directors who sits on the 
foundation's Grants Committee. One estimate has the AAF approving perhaps as 
many as 80% of the applications it receives. 
"We like to put it into areas that need it the most. It's one of our primary 
goals," Argue said. "What we're trying to do is put balls and bats in the hands 
of kids." 
June Canham would like that. 
"We certainly could use it," said Canham, volunteer treasurer of the Southeast 
Santa Ana Little League, which serves children in one of the poorest 
neighborhoods of Orange County's most impoverished city. 
Two years ago, the Southeast Santa Ana Little League ran into financial 
difficulties. Children did not get their trophies because there was no money. 
There was a shortage of uniforms, so neighboring Little Leagues donated some. 
Last year, the league had to raise sign-up fees from $30 to $35 per child. The 
league remains about $17,000 in debt. 
Canham estimates that there would be at least twice the 200 youngsters ages 5 
to 14 who participate in the program if they could afford to join. 
"We're doing our utmost to keep the children off the streets," Canham said. 
There are no other organized sports programs serving the youth of the 
high-crime, low-income neighborhood around Standard Street and Edinger Avenue, 
she said. 
However, Southeast Santa Ana Little League may be too impoverished to qualify 
for an AAF grant. The foundation's criteria discourage grants to pay off debts. 
"Some people say (that they are) $20,000 in debt and would like a grant to get 
. . . solvent -- we do not do that," said Judith Pinero, AAF's vice president 
in charge of grants. "We want to fund programs that . . . have had some degree 
of self-sufficiency. . . . 
"We're here to provide funding without interest or repayment to organizations 
that run quality sports programs and we're here to help them enhance what they 
are already doing well." 
The Southeast Santa Ana Little League's current board of directors inherited 
the budget deficit, according to Robert Jackson, Little League District 30 
administrator. 
Jackson was ready to shut down the league until Canham and other volunteers 
came forward last year. 
Canham, who took over management of the finances, only recently learned of the 
Olympic grant program when advised by a reporter. 
"A lot of leagues probably don't know anything about it," she said. 
Indeed, the AAF's Pinero conceded that despite widespread publicity and 
promotion of the grants, "there are a lot of people who don't know about us. . 
. . We are constantly trying to get the word out." 
"When we have money," Argue said, "you'd assume that a lot of people would like 
to have some of it. 
"(But) people need to apply to get it." 
Argue maintains that a "lack of infrastructure" to encourage communication 
between leaders of many youth sports is what makes it difficult for local 
groups to obtain grants. As a result, the AAF has resorted to "creating our own 
programs," he said. 
"We have formed sports clubs in public housing areas and get the people 
involved" in East Los Angeles and South Central Los Angeles, he said. 
In Orange County since the 1984 Olympics, the AAF has awarded direct grants to 
17 locally based groups, such as $3,500 to Tustin Pony Baseball and $67,400 to 
the Huntington Valley Boys and Girls Clubs. 
"I think quite a substantial amount of money has gone out there," Argue said. 
But a much greater percentage of the grants has gone to Los Angeles County. 
"We have a tendency to give more money where more events were held," Argue 
said. 
(During the '84 Games, Orange County hosted Olympic team handball at Cal State 
Fullerton, wrestling at the Anaheim Convention Center, cycling on the streets 
of Mission Viejo, and the pentathlon at Coto de Caza and Irvine.) 
The foundation's announced intention is to serve the "same broad cross-section 
that contributed so much to the success of the 1984 Olympics." 
"Take a baseball team in East L.A.," Argue said. "If we buy bats and balls and 
uniforms, then it means that the neighborhood doesn't have to, so they don't 
have to charge anybody anything to play." 
That scenario sounds wonderful to Tim Bradley, a father of seven who volunteers 
to help run the Tri-Cities football program in Buena Park, La Palma and 
Cypress. Bradley also was unaware of the AAF grants. 
"The kids we seem to attract are from the lower-income areas -- mostly Buena 
Park," Bradley said. "Their parents really can't afford our fees." 
Although registration is $75, it totals about $240 per child for equipment, 
insurance and other costs, Bradley said. The balance must be obtained through 
fund-raising events. 
"We used to run about 20%, but now we're up to about 40%" of parents unable to 
pay registration, he said. "It just seems like every year it gets to be a 
higher and higher" percentage. 
"Our home field is around an area that is not very good, and it seems like we 
get a lot of those kids. We try to take them off the street." 
What are the options for youngsters who can't afford to sign up? 
"Stand around and get shot," Bradley said. "Right next to our field, we had two 
people get shot by drive-by shootings." 
Some Orange County organizations have been aware of the AAF grants, but the 
grant applications were turned down, Pinero said. 
In 1986, there was a request from the Anaheim Parks and Recreation Community 
Services Department to fund "a recreation and socialization program for the 
physically disabled and head-injured adult population." 
Pinero said the application was rejected because the AAF does not give money to 
governmental agencies or fund programs for adults. 
Were the AAF to fund public agencies, Pinero said, "city councils and the 
powers that be would just say: 'Hey, the foundation will do it, why should we 
do it?' " 
The AAF may frown on giving money directly to public entities, but the 
foundation has given sizable grants to a private foundation that uses the money 
to provide a service to Los Angeles public schools. 
The Constitutional Rights Foundation has used its AAF money to conduct a Sports 
and the Law Workshop for Los Angeles Unified School District teachers who 
integrate it into their eighth-to-11th grade curriculum, Pinero said. 
The foundation provides the workshops and curriculum because the school 
district won't pay for it, Pinero said. 
AAF officials say that Orange County also benefits from grants to agencies that 
transcend geographic boundaries, such as about $230,000 contributed to the 
National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis and $61,000 to the California Amateur 
Hockey Assn. 
Still, the largest grant to an individual program based in Orange County has 
been the $115,000 to the Newport Aquatic Center. 
Every three months, new grants are announced. About $300,000 will be awarded 
Friday, but there are no Orange County groups being considered, Pinero said. 
Sooner or later, however, Orange County might be in line for some more Olympic 
money. 
Both Grant from the Newport Aquatic Center and Wilson from Crown Valley Divers 
say they probably will ask for more money. 
"We intend to go back to the Amateur Athletic Foundation for more equipment and 
more support," Grant said. "It seems like you can't do anything for less than 
$100,000." 
"Why shouldn't rowing be as exciting as football in high school?" Grant asked. 
"Why should rowing have to have the bake sales? Why should these sports 
struggle like this? We clearly need some help." 
GRANTS TO ORANGE COUNTY YOUTH FACILITIES 
The Amateur Athletic Foundation has handed out $30 million since 1984 -- about 
$1.9 million to groups in Orange County or to regional groups servicing the 
county. The rest went to groups outside the county.
