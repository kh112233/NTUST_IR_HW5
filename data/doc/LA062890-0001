METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY ORDERS STUDY ON 8 TRAFFIC 
BOTTLENECKS 
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, acting on a motion by 
chairman Ed Edelman, directed its staff Wednesday to conduct a study on how to 
relieve traffic congestion in the county's eight most clogged corridors. 
The six-month study will lead to the development of a congestion management 
plan, required by the recent passage of Proposition 111, which raised the state 
gasoline tax. 
"If the cities (in the county) want money from the commission" they will have 
to work with the agency to implement the plan," Edelman said. 
The gas tax hike -- starting with a nickel-a-gallon increase Aug. 1 and 
one-cent increase for each of the next four years -- is expected to raise $15.5 
billion over the next 10 years. 
"We can now draw strategies that will help provide the relief to commuters who 
must travel on the busiest" roads, Edelman said.
