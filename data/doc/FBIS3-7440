<F P=106> ["Statement of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk on the </F>
rights and freedom of the press in Cambodia"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 March 1994. 
  I would like the beloved Royal Government to please 
immediately release from prison Mr. Nguon Non, editor of the 
Phnom Penh-based newspaper the Morning News, so as to restore 
his rights and freedom as a journalist. 
  If Mr. Nguon Non, editor of the Morning News, has really 
committed any offense such as defamation, the victims may seek 
justice from the court by filing a suit against Mr. Nguon Non. 
Nevertheless, I am absolutely opposed to any arrest or detention 
of journalists without trials. 
  I would like to stress once again that all of us, including 
the king, the Royal Government, the administration, the armed 
forces, the police, and so forth must respect 100 percent the 
rights and freedom of the press. 
  [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk.
