  [Text] Lima, 28 Dec (EFE) -- Alleged members of the 
terrorist group Shining Path, on Tuesday, detonated two car 
bombs near the Prefecture (Civilian Government) of Lima, causing 
a great deal of damage and killing at least one policeman, 
although the death has not been officially confirmed. Another 
nine policemen and at least 20 civilians were injured. 
  The homes in front of the Prefecture, which is on Espana 
Avenue in the area near the U.S. Embassy and the Sheraton Hotel, 
were totally destroyed and are now uninhabitable. 
  The shock wave destroyed stores, businesses, and banks on 
Alfonso Ugarte Avenue, which is perpendicular to Espana Avenue. 
  The terrorists detonated one car bomb against the Prefecture 
from Alfonso Ugarte Avenue. The explosion at 0545 local (1045 
GMT) destroyed a police armored personnel carrier in which human 
remains were seen. It is therefore presumed that at least one 
policeman died inside. 
  Another car bomb was detonated near the Prefecture at the 
corner of Alfonso Ugarte and Bolivia Avenues. 
  Seven injured policemen, some in serious condition, were 
sent 
to the Lima Police hospital. 
  Approximately 200 policemen have been mobilized to protect 
the area and search out the attackers.
