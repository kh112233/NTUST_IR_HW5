  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that 
following yesterday's double demarches on U.S. State Department 
Spokesman Michael McCurry's statement, the Greek Government 
would receive with satisfaction any clarification from the U.S. 
side. He added that McCurry's position, on setting the airspace 
and territorial waters at six miles, basically concerns NATO's 
maneuvers and is related to the more general, international U.S. 
positions.
