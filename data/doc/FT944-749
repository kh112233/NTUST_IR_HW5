FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T acquires Interchange
Network
AT&amp;T, the US telecoms group, has purchased the Interchange Network from
Ziff-Davis Publishing, Reuter reports from New York.
Interchange provides small publishers with the architecture and editorial
tools to build next-generation electronic newspapers and magazines, and
control pricing, advertising and presentation. Interchange is in the second
stage of testing, and is expected to be commercially available in 1995.
Although no financial details were disclosed, it has been reported that the
acquisition would cost more than Dollars 50m, down from Dollars 100m
originally sought, because of impending competition from Microsoft, which in
November announced plans to develop its own online service.
