The Proposal 


The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to extend Colored
Federal Airways G10, R99, and realign Colored Federal Airway B37 as a result of the decommissioning
of the Cape Spencer Marine NDB. Colored Federal Airways G10 and R99 would be extended and would include
an extension of G10 from Woody Island to Kachemak. King Salmon, AK, NDB was inadvertently used in the descriptions
of Colored Federal Airways G8 and G12, and as a result of this proposal, Saldo, AK, NDB would replace King
Salmon, AK, NDB. King Salmon, AK, Locator Outer Marker in the description of B27 would be replaced with Saldo,
AK, NDB. Finally, as a result of the Quinhagak, AK, VOR/DME being decommissioned, this action would remove that segment
of V308 between Quinhagak, AK, and Bethel, AK, and would realign V328 as a direct route between Dillingham,
AK, and Kipnuk, AK. Colored Federal airways are published in paragraphs 6009(a), 6009(b), and 6009(d) respectively,
and Alaskan VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(b), of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective
September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Colored Federal airways and the Alaskan
VOR Federal airways listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. 
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
