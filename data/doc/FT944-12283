FT  02 NOV 94 / Observer: Brotherly affectation
It must be getting close to an election - president Carlos Menem has started
talking about the Falkland Islands again. If Argentina were to gain
sovereignty from the UK, he might offer cash to any of the 2,100 Falklanders
who didn't want to stay.
'It's one of many issues under consideration . . . don't forget that Alaska
was bought from Russia,' says Menem. It was indeed, in 1867, for Dollars
7.2m. Given there's strong evidence of black gold reserves round the
islands, what price has he in mind?
Meanwhile, his brother Eduardo, president of the Argentine senate, has
popped across to the UK. Today he watches the Duke of Edinburgh unveil a
monument to Argentine general Jose de San Martin, liberator of Argentina,
Chile and Peru from the Spanish yoke, who also lived in London.
Eduardo - the most senior Argentine official to visit the UK since the
resumption of diplomatic relations in 1990 - is also getting lunch from
Douglas Hurd. His schedule includes meetings with other UK government
ministers - those who are left, anyway - but oddly enough, not John Major.
Maybe some deal could be done whereby the islanders are temporarily housed
in the Ritz in Paris, in exchange for which the Menems negotiate a truce
between The Guardian newspaper and the Tories?
After all, Buenos Aires also has its Harrods. . .
