MIGRATING WHALES ARE TOPICS OF TOURS, TALKS 
Every year around this time, the California gray whales make their trip from 
the Bering Sea to Baja California, passing close to the California coastline. 
Going out to see the whales has become quite popular in recent years. In some 
cases, overzealous whale watchers have been accused of interfering with the 
whales' migration. 
One way to avoid disturbing the huge mammals and learn about their lives, 
habitat and the effects humans may have on them, is to attend an informational 
program or go along on one of several whale-watching tours offered by the many 
museums or marine life related groups in the area. 
The Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro, in conjunction with the American 
Cetacean Society, is having its 18th year of whale-watching trips every day 
through the beginning of April. Naturalists trained in whale behavior provide 
information to participants throughout the trips. Call (213) 832-4444 or (213) 
832-2676. 
Visitors to Channel Islands National Park can learn about whales in a program 
with park rangers each Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. through mid-April at the 
Visitor Center in Ventura. Call (805) 644-8262. 
Farther north, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History naturalists will share 
their knowledge about whales on trips aboard the Condor on Saturday and Sunday 
mornings throughout March.
