on 18 Mar 94: "Statistical Report Issued by Guizhou Provincial 
Statistics Bureau on National Economic and Social Development in 
1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the leadership of the provincial 
party committee and government, the people of various 
nationalities across the province made further efforts to put 
into effect the guidelines from Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
important remarks made during his inspection tour of South China 
and from the 14th National Party Congress; seized the 
opportunity; deepened reform; and accelerated development while 
closely centering around the objective of establishing a new 
socialist market economic structure. Moreover, in light of the 
conspicuous contradictions which emerged in the macroeconomic 
operation and the actual conditions of the province, they 
carried out the central policies and measures for intensifying 
macroeconomic regulation and control and attained positive 
results. In the course of readjusting the industrial and 
economic structures, new developments were made in the tertiary 
industry, township and town enterprises, nonpublic economic 
sectors, and so on, and some new economic growth points began to 
take shape. The national economy of the entire province 
advanced through in-depth reform and a sustained and faster 
growth was scored as difficulties were overcome. According to 
preliminary statistics, the GNP in the year reached 37.4 billion 
yuan, up 9.1 percent over the previous year, and the rapid 
growth, as judged by international standards, has lasted for 
three consecutive years. Of the total values increased, those 
of primary, secondary, and tertiary industries registered 13.1, 
14, and 10.3 billion yuan, up 4.1, 10, and 15 percent 
respectively. If their proportion in the year's GNP were 
compared with 1992, that of the primary industry fell from 36.5 
to 35 percent, that of the secondary industry rose from 37 to 
37.4 percent, and that of the tertiary industry rose from 26.5 
to 27.6 percent. 
  Along with the national economic development, considerable 
headway was also made in various social undertakings throughout 
the province. The scientific and technological undertakings 
made new strides in transforming their research results into 
productive forces; in the educational undertakings, serious 
attention was paid to the readjustment of courses offered in 
various schools to train qualified personnel for the market 
economy; in sports undertakings, a new breakthrough was made in 
the level of competition; and corresponding development was also 
attained in various undertakings including culture, public 
health, insurance, environmental protection, and so on. 
  In 1993, urban and rural in-depth reform was coordinated 
with 
economic and social development and reform in many areas was 
notably expedited. This was manifested in the following 
aspects: 1) with regard to rural reform, under the precondition 
of stabilizing and perfecting the contract responsibility system 
on a household basis with remuneration linked to output and the 
two-tier management system under which unified management is 
combined with separate management, relevant provincial units 
conscientiously reorganized those agriculture-related economic 
and technical departments into economic entities, further 
established and amplified the agricultural socialized service 
system, and made giant strides in practicing the joint-stock 
system in township and town enterprises and building township 
and town industrial districts. 2) with regard to enterprise 
reform, the work was focused on the transformation of 
operational mechanisms and, through clarifying and straightening 
out the relations between ownership and management, enterprises 
accelerated their process of changing traditional operational 
mechanisms and instituting a modern enterprise system. By the 
end of 1993, 20 enterprises were approved to form joint-stock 
limited companies and more than 160 enterprises were approved to 
form limited liability companies, with the stocks of two such 
companies successfully listed on stock markets. In addition, 
noticeable progress was also made by the province's commercial 
enterprises in the transformation of operational mechanisms. 
Some 61.7 percent of these enterprises lifted controls over 
operation, pricing, employment, and distribution, and 22.6 
percent of state-owned commercial and supply and marketing 
cooperatives tried to practice a "state-owned, community-run" 
system or had their original enterprises transformed into 
joint-stock companies. 3) With regard to price reform, new 
advances were made in comprehensively relaxing control over 
prices and operation in purchasing and marketing grain and 
edible oil and the prices of some basic products and service 
charges of some basic industries were readjusted and raised. 
Commodity prices regulated by the market grew in number, with 95 
percent of consumer goods and 85 percent of the means of 
production now regulated by the market, thus gradually 
establishing a mechanism whereby prices are mainly fixed by the 
market. 4) Over 300 scientific research institutes were 
transformed into scientific and technological entities, or 
scientific research units run by the local people. 5) New 
progress was also scored in reform in other fields including the 
housing and social insurance systems, sales of land use rights, 
organizational reform, and so on. 
  The prominent problems the province's economic development 
experienced in 1993 were: The difference between social supply 
and demand slightly exceeded reasonable limits and the 
difficulty in maintaining a balance between total supply and 
total demand increased; the contradictions between 
transportation and economic growth were conspicuous, energy was 
in short supply, and the "bottleneck" constraints were 
aggravated; the margin of price increases were excessively large 
and, in particular, the margin of increase in rural areas was 
larger than in cities which, to a certain extent, affected and 
restrained the further enhancement of living standards of rural 
residents and some urban residents; in the organizational and 
operational modes of agricultural production, the application of 
administrative means and management mode in the small-scale 
peasant economy were still relatively prominent and there was 
still no mechanism to lead peasants into the market; and the 
shortage of funds and the performance of enterprises still 
constituted two obstacles which hindered economic development. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  In 1993, the people in various localities across the 
province 
conscientiously put into practice the policies of the party's 
Central Committee and the State Council on intensifying 
agriculture and maintaining steady agricultural development, 
taking firm control of the comprehensive management in 
agriculture, making efforts to invigorate agriculture through 
the application of scientific and technological advances, and 
positively improving the conditions of production to ensure the 
steady growth of agricultural production. The value added to 
farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery in 1993 totaled 
13.1 billion yuan, an increase of 4.1 percent, and their total 
output value came to 20.14 billion yuan, up 4.2 percent. Of this 
total, farming accounted for 12.62 billion yuan, up 5.9 percent; 
forestry for 1.185 billion yuan, down 9.9 percent; animal 
husbandry for 6.233 billion yuan, up 3.9 percent; and fishery 
for 102 million yuan, a relatively big increase. 
  In the production of major agricultural products, there was 
a 
bumper harvest in grain in 1993, another year of record highs 
second only to 1991, the output of cured tobacco hit an all-time 
high but that of rapeseed decreased substantially. The 
province's total grain output for the year was 8.695 million 
tonnes, an increase of 806,000 tonnes or 10.2 percent, only 1.8 
percent less than 1991, which witnessed the record yield of 
8.855 million tonne. Of this total, summer grain accounted for 
1.695 million tonne and autumn grain 7 million tonnes, 
increases of 21,000 and 785,000 tonnes or 1.3 and 12.6 percent 
respectively. The year's total output of cured tobacco came to 
497,000 tonnes, an increase of 48,000 tonne or 10.6 percent and 
that of rapeseed totalled 386,000 tonne, down 22.8 percent.

  New progress was made in afforestation. In 1993, an area of 
287,000 hectares (4.305 million mu) was afforested, an increase 
of 19,000 hectares (285,000 mu) or 7 percent. Of this, manmade 
afforestation covered an area of 242,000 hectares, up 9.2 
percent. There were increases and decreases of output in major 
forest products. The increases included raw lacquer, tallow 
seeds, gall nuts, pine nuts, bamboo shoots, and chestnuts, with 
the output of chestnuts increasing by 16 percent. The decreases 
included tung tree nuts, tea oil camellia nuts, palm chips [zong 
pian 2762 3651], and walnuts, with the former two items 
decreasing by 5.8 and 20.7 percent respectively. 
  A sustained development momentum reappeared in animal 
husbandry. In 1993, the total output of meat across the province 
was 889,000 tonne, up 3.9 percent. Of this total, that of pork, 
beef, and mutton reached 847,000 tonne, 3.6 percent more than in 
1992. The share of animal husbandry in the total output value 
of farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery was 31 
percent, an increase of 3.5 percentage points.

  The margin of increase in fishery was larger in 1993 than 
in 1992. The total catch of aquatic products reached 25,549 
tonne, an increase of 1,942 tonne or 8.2 percent and its margin 
of increase was 5.1 percentage points higher. 
  The technical level of agricultural production was enhanced 
to some extent and the scale of agricultural machinery 
allocation was expanded. In 1993, the proportion held by the 
improved varieties of hybrid rice and maize in the areas sown to 
these crops rose to 68 percent from 62.7 percent. The area of 
cultivation using practical agricultural techniques, including 
cultivating rice seedlings in two stages, standardized 
cultivation of paddy rice, rotation of crops on dry land, 
dissemination of growing maize on a tight schedule [jin cou xing 
4868 0410 0992], and so on increased somewhat. By the end of 
1993, the aggregate power of the province's farm machinery 
reached 3.514 million kw, up 11.6 percent. Of this, irrigation 
and drainage equipment had a total power capacity of 466,000 kw 
and processing equipment for agricultural products had a 
capacity of 1.386 million kw, up 18.6 and 9.6 percent 
respectively. There were 34,700 small tractors and rototillers, 
8,591 farm-related trucks, 721 spraying machines, and 52,400 
pumps for agricultural use. There were also 1,004 hydropower 
stations run by townships and villages across the province and 
the power generation in rural areas for the year was 536 million 
kwh. The application of chemical fertilizers (with 100 percent 
effective content equivalent) and pesticides reached 582,700 and 
7,800 tonne respectively. 
  Township and town enterprises entered a new development 
period with their total output value and business turnover 
breaking through the barrier of 10 billion yuan. According to 
the statistics of the Township and Town Enterprise Bureau, the 
total output value of the province's township and town 
enterprises amounted to 12.283 billion yuan (at 1990 constant 
prices), a growth of 40 percent and the business turnover for 
the year came to 13.016 billion yuan, a growth of 53 percent. 
<H5>  II. Industry and the Construction Industry </H5>
  Taking transformation of operational mechanisms, 
readjustment 
of product mix, and enhancement of economic results as focal 
points, the province's industrial enterprises made efforts to 
incrementally adapt themselves to the objective requirements of 
establishing a socialist market economy in various ways, at 
different levels, and through multiple channels in 1993. While 
overcoming difficulties and contradictions, such as shortage of 
funds, energy, and transportation capacity, as well as rapid 
changes in commodity markets, they maintained steady growth in 
industrial production. The total industrial output value 
registered 38.247 billion yuan, up 13.4 percent. Of this total, 
that at and above the township level came to 32.472 billion yuan 
and the added value was 10.739 billion yuan, up 8.8 and 7.2 
percent respectively. 
  As viewed from the types of industry, heavy industry showed 
a 
good momentum while light industry declined. In 1993, the total 
output value of heavy industry at and above the township level 
amounted to 22.323 billion yuan and its added value came to 
6.659 billion yuan, up 16.4 and 14.1 percent respectively. The 
total output value of light industry at and above the township 
level amounted to 10.149 billion yuan and the added value 
totalled 4.08 billion yuan, down 4.2 and 5.3 percent 
respectively. 
  As viewed from different economic sectors, nonpublic 
industry 
grew rapidly, while state-owned industry grew slowly. In 1993, 
of the total industrial output value at the township level and 
above, that of collective industry amounted to 4.611 billion 
yuan and that of other economic sectors amounted to 621 million 
yuan, up 21.4 and 10.5 percent respectively. However, the 
output value of state-owned industry totalled 27.241 billion 
yuan, increasing by only 6.5 percent, and its growth rate was 
14.9 and 4 percentage points lower than the collective and other 
economic sectors during the corresponding period. 
  Large and medium industrial enterprises continued to 
maintain 
their backbone position. In 1993, the total output value 
realized by large and medium-sized enterprises registered 21.902 
billion yuan, their added value amounted to 8.194 billion yuan, 
and their sales value totalled 21.049 billion yuan, accounting 
for 67.4, 76.3, and 68.3 percent respectively of the targets 
among industrial enterprises of similar size at the township 
level and above. The rate of production and marketing of large 
and medium enterprises was 96.1 percent, 2.8 percentage points 
higher than that of industrial enterprises. 
  The economic results in some industrial enterprises improved 
but the linkage between production and marketing was relatively 
poor. Judging from the industrial enterprises with independent 
accounting the overall labor productivity (in terms of value 
added) rose from 10,467 yuan in 1992 to 12,891 yuan in 1993; the 
profit rate on product sales rose by 0.5 percent; and the cost 
of sales income for 100 yuan was reduced by 6.6 yuan. However, 
the amount of losses reached 731 million yuan, 20.2 percent more 
than in 1992; the turnover of circulating capital slowed down by 
0.1 times to register only 1.25 times; the profit and tax rate 
on capital fell to 12.1 percent from 13.8 percent in 1992; the 
rate of industrial added value dropped from 38.9 to 37.4 
percent; and the composite index of economic results was 96.6. 
In 1993, the rate of production and marketing of industrial 
enterprises at the township level and above was 93.3 percent, a 
decline of 4.3 percentage points. Hence, the work linking 
production with marketing should be further intensified.

  The building industry strived to develop amid competition 
and 
its overall labor productivity was heightened. Value added by 
the state-owned building industry was 730 million yuan, an 
actual increase of 3.8 percent after allowing for price rises. 
Of this, value added by the building industry belonging to the 
central and local authorities was 470 and 260 million yuan, 
increases of 7.2 and 3.4 percent respectively. The overall 
labor productivity of this industry calculated with the output 
value of projects under construction rose to 19,502 yuan from 
14,808 yuan in 1992. The output value of projects completed 
during the year was 1.354 billion yuan, up 26.5 percent, and the 
completion rate was 54.6 percent, down 4.1 percentage points. 
The number of contracted operations in the building industry 
increased. In 1993, the contracted responsibility system was 
practiced in 88.7 percent of state-owned construction 
enterprises, up 5.4 percent age points. There were 1,072 
projects involving units undertaking contracts through public 
bidding, an increase of 72 projects and accounting for 29.4 
percent of the projects under the contracted responsibility 
system, showing a slight increase. 
<H5>  III. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  In 1993, the pace of construction in the province was 
notably 
quickened and investment was expanded by a large margin. 
According to preliminary statistics, the fixed-asset investment 
by the entire society during 1993 amounted to 9.603 billion 
yuan, up 35.4 percent. Of this total, investment accomplished by 
state-owned units amounted to 7.29 billion yuan, 34.5 percent 
up, and its proportion in the fixed-asset investment of the 
entire society reached 75.9 percent. Investment accomplished by 
the collective economic sector and urban and rural individuals 
amounted to 550 million and 1.763 billion yuan respectively. Of 
the total investment by state-owned units, that of capital 
construction came to 4.31 billion yuan and that of technical 
innovation and transformation came to 2.38 billion yuan, up 30.8 
and 33.9 percent respectively. 
  Investment in local projects increased by a larger margin 
with the proportion rising to some extent. Of the fixed-asset 
investment accomplished by state-owned units, that of local 
projects amounted to 4.03 billion yuan, up 36.4 percent and its 
proportion rose from 55.3 to 54.5 percent. Of this, investment 
in capital construction projects and innovation and 
transformation projects by the local authorities amounted to 
2.26 and 1.22 billion yuan, up 44.0 and 13.4 percent 
respectively. Whereas, investment in projects by the central 
authorities reached 3.26 billion yuan, up 32.2 percent. 
  New headway was made in key construction projects. In 1993, 
there were 21 large and medium state-owned capital construction 
projects in the province. Of these, 18 projects were officially 
started, two were being wound up, and one was being prepared. 
Investment in large and medium projects completed during the 
year amounted to 2 billion yuan, which was 97.9 percent of the 
plan and accounted for 46.3 percent of the accomplished 
investment in state-owned capital construction projects. In 
1993, there were 26 technical innovation and transformation 
projects above the norm and investment in these projects 
totalled 530 million yuan, accounting for 22.1 percent of such 
investments made by state-owned units. By the end of 1993, one 
large capital construction project, five single-item projects, 
and two above-norm projects were completed and put into 
operation. 
  Investment in commercial housing increased substantially. In 
1993, investment in commercial housing in the province amounted 
to 384 million yuan, a growth of 190 million yuan, or 96.5 
percent . Of this, investment in residential housing came to 310 
million yuan, a growth of 110 percent. Construction area of 
completed commercial housing totalled 600,000 square meters, of 
which residential premises covered an area of 500,000 square 
meters. Investment in commercial housing accounted for 32.5 
percent of the province's total investment in residential 
premises, which was 7.4 percent higher than in 1992. 
  New changes occurred in the investment structure as more 
investments were made in the energy and tertiary industries. In 
the province's fixed-asset investment made by state-owned units 
during the year, investment in the energy industry totalled 1.77 
billion yuan, an increase of 43 percent and accounting for 38.7 
percent of industrial investment. Of this total, that for the 
power industry increased by 49.4 percent, its share of 
industrial investment rising from 22.9 to 29.3 percent, and that 
for the tertiary industry totalled 2.6 billion yuan, up 92.1 
percent. Of this total, that for transport and post and 
telecommunications amounted to 860 million yuan, 1.2 times 
higher than 1992 and accounting for 32.9 percent of the 
investment in the tertiary industry. Key construction projects 
which were started in turn included the Guiyang-Zunyi Special 
Highway, the Guiyang Eastern Gate Highway, the first phase of 
the Panxiang-Baise Highway between Anlong and Hongjiang, 
Longdongbao Airport, and so on. Investment by state-owned units 
used to renovate and transform old projects to increase 
varieties and raise the quality of products amounted to 660 
million yuan, an increase of 17.4, accounting for 27.7 percent 
of the total investment in project renovation and 
transformation. However, agricultural investment and its 
proportion declined. Investment by state-owned units used in 
farming, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and water 
conservancy totalled 90 million yuan, down 4.8 percent, with its 
proportion dropping to 1.2 percent, down 0.5 of a percentage 
point. 
  There were 1,935 projects of capital construction, 
renovation, and transformation completed and put into operation 
in the province during the year, 1,678 of which were local 
projects. The newly increased fixed assets amounted to 4.15 
billion yuan, up 57.7 percent. The completed housing 
construction area totalled 4.12 million square meters, of which 
the residential area was 1.98 million square meters. The newly 
increased production capacity and project efficiency included 
40,000 tonne of electrolyzed aluminum, 232,000 kw of installed 
generator capacity, 202 km of transmission lines, 40,000 tonne 
of cement, 20,000 tonne of synthetic ammonia, 2,500 tonne of 
plastic and resin copolymer, 300,000 outer tires, 35,000 
automatic urban telephone lines, and 150,000 cubic meters of 
gas. In addition, the Guiyang Huaguoyuan Flyover and the 
Dafang-Nayong Class-two Highway were also completed and opened 
to traffic. 
  The major tough problems confronted by investment in 
construction projects were the considerable shortage of funds 
and the sharp price increases of building materials, which 
affected the progress of some key projects as well as investment 
effectiveness. 
<H5>  IV. Transport, Post and Telecommunications </H5>
  Taking the improvement of transport conditions as a dragon 
head, the province laid firm hold on the construction of 
infrastructural transportation facilities. In 1993, the 
province's total mileage of highways in operation reached 32,100 
km, an increase of 434 km. There were 20,300 km of highways of 
various grades in this total, an increase of 250 km. The rate 
of highways reaching certain grades was 63.1 percent. With 
transport operation as their nucleus, the existing transport 
enterprises tapped the potential for raising efficiency and 
increasing volume to ensure the effective transportation of key 
materials. The total volume of freight transport during the 
year was 160.55 million tonne, up 15.2 percent. The cargo volume 
was 30.091 billion tonne/km and that of passengers was 11.399 
billion person/km, both increasing by 13.4 percent .

  New developments were made in post and telecommunications 
undertakings. In 1993, the overall length of mail routes across 
the province reached 40,500 km, an increase of 3,000 km, and the 
total business transactions amounted to 277 million yuan (at 
1990 constant prices), an increase of 43.8 percent . Of this 
total, there were 71.59 million letters, 4.79 million telegrams, 
22.13 million long-distance calls, and 3,223 long-distance 
telephone lines, increases of 24.7, 8.4, 75.1 and 68.2 percent 
respectively. By the end of 1993, there were 155,100 urban 
telephone lines and 103,500 program-controlled lines, up 45.9 
and 220 percent respectively, and urban telephone subscribers 
totalled 100,900, an increase of 35.4 percent. 
<H5>  V. Domestic Trade and Market Prices </H5>
  In 1993, there were ample commodities in the markets 
throughout the province, sales grew steadily, and supplies of 
goods remained in a state of basic equilibrium. The total 
volume of social commodities purchased during the year was 26.69 
billion yuan and the volume of commodities in stock at the 
year's end totalled 9.718 billion yuan, up 61.8 percent. The 
total volume of retail sales amounted to 13.119 billion yuan, up 
12.7 percent. Of this, the retail sales volume of consumer 
goods totalled 11.832 billion yuan, up 15.2 percent. 
  Import and export trade grew steadily. In 1993, the 
province's total volume of import and export trade reached $363 
million, an increase of 8.2 percent, with exports of $245 
million and imports of $118 million, up 9.2 and 6.1 percent 
respectively. By the end of 1993, countries and regions having 
trade relations with Guizhou increased to 77. 
  Remarkable achievements were attained in importing foreign 
capital. Some 500 contracts to utilize foreign capital were 
signed, 290 more than in 1992. The contract amount totalled 
$645 million, an increase of 2.4 times. Foreign capital 
actually used in the year amounted to $42.94 million, a 1.2-fold 
increase. Of the foreign capital actually used, fund placement 
was extended to the tertiary industry from the secondary 
industry. The investment rate in secondary industry fell from 
95 to 88.9 percent, while that in the tertiary industry rose 
from 5 to 11.1 percent. 
  The tourist trade maintained a booming momentum. Making full 
use of the unique advantage of tourist resources, the province 
successfully sponsored the "Azalea Flower Festival" and the 
"1993 China Huangguoshu Sightseeing and China International 
Famous Wine Festival," which attracted a large number of 
overseas tourists. In the meantime, serious attention was paid 
to the construction of tourist service facilities to enhance the 
service level. Some 102,500 overseas tourists were received, an 
increase of 34.3 percent. Of these, foreigners numbered 42,600, 
an increase of 1.3 times; Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, 
and Taiwan compatriots totalled 59,900, an increase of 4 
percent. Foreign exchange earned from tourism amounted to 84.05 
million yuan (foreign exchange equivalent in terms of renminbi), 
an increase of 1.2 times. 
<H5>  VI. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health, and Sports </H5>
  New achievements were scored in science and technology, 
which 
provided fine conditions for the transformation of science and 
technology into productive forces. Research results were 
obtained in 280 projects, of which nine projects reached 
advanced international standards. A total of 205 projects 
received prizes for scientific and technological progress at the 
provincial level. Of this total, there were two first prizes, 18 
second prizes, 101 third prizes, and 84 fourth prizes. Among 
the research results scored by ordinary institutions of higher 
learning, 113 items passed appraisal, an increase of 25. The 
provincial government gave handsome awards to a number of 
scientific and technological development projects of a very high 
technical level and with outstanding economic results. By the 
end of 1993, there were 115 independent scientific research 
institutes above the county level and 24 scientific research 
organs under institutions of higher learning, which had been 
approved by the competent upper departments. However, the 
number of personnel engaged in scientific and technological 
activities declined and those reduced in ordinary tertiary 
institutions alone totalled 1,084 people. 
  Educational undertakings continued to develop in the course 
of speeded up structural readjustment. Provincial educational 
institutions took in 86 postgraduates and the total number of 
students taking graduate courses was 196. Ordinary institutions 
of higher learning enrolled 10,113 undergraduates for regular or 
specialized courses and the number of enrolled students totalled 
29,305. More than 40 new specialties were established in 
ordinary colleges and universities to meet the requirements of 
economic and social development. Some 17.3 percent of students 
were studying in these colleges or universities at their own 
expenses. Secondary vocational schools took in 24,435 students 
and the number of enrolled students in these schools totalled 
63,540. The enrolled students in senior and junior high schools 
totalled 124,500 and 881,100 respectively and the number of 
enrolled students in various secondary vocational and technical 
schools accounted for 47 percent of the total number of students 
receiving senior secondary education. The number of enrolled 
pupils totalled 4.398 million, with the enrollment rate for 
school-age children reaching 93.8 percent. Primary education 
was made universal in 74 percent of the 86 counties throughout 
the province and illiteracy numbers were reduced by 209,000. 
There were 985 kindergartens attended by 313,800 children. New 
achievements were made in tertiary education through self study. 
In 1993, 52,700 people signed up to participate in academic 
examinations through self study, achieving passes in 46,300 
single subjects and were granted certificates accordingly. The 
number of graduates through self study was 2,625, an increase of 
18 percent, but the high dropout rate remained a problem. In 
ordinary secondary schools, the dropout rate hit 8.9 percent, up 
5.3 percentage points, and in primary schools the rate was 7.5 
percent, with that in rural primary schools reaching 7.9 percent. 
  Cultural undertakings made contributions to enriching 
people's cultural lives. In 1993, the province successfully 
sponsored the "China Guizhou International Children's Art 
Festival." By the end of 1993, there were 32 art performance 
groups with 15 specialized art performance sites; seven 
broadcasting stations and 11 transmission and relay stations, 
with a coverage rate of 58.4 percent, a slight increase ; eight 
television stations and 1,350 transmission and relay stations, 
increases of one and 248 stations respectively, with a coverage 
rate of 66.2 percent, up 2.5 percentage points. There were also 
86 libraries and 84 cultural centers. In addition, 113.39 
million copies of books, 7.56 million copies of magazines, and 
170.26 million copies of newspapers of various kinds were 
published during the year. 
  Improvements were made in the conditions of medical care and 
public health. By the end of 1993, there were 1,623 hospitals 
with 51,900 beds, 1,563 out-patient clinics, 89 women and 
children health care centers, and 107 epidemic prevention 
stations among the 3,908 public health organs across the 
province. Meanwhile, the province boasted 103,000 specialized 
personnel for public health, including 4,067 practioners of 
traditional Chinese medicine, 20,521 doctors, 193 senior doctors 
combining Chinese with Western medical science, 8,613 
experienced nurses, and 9,723 nurses. 
  Urban markets were brisk while rural markets appeared to 
be bleak. In 1993, the retail sales volume of consumer goods in 
cities amounted to 6.308 billion yuan, that in county towns 
amounted to 2.639 billion yuan, and that in places below the 
county level amounted to 2.885 billion yuan, up 25.8, 6, and 4.3 
percent respectively. If price rises were allowed for, the 
actual retail sales volume of consumer goods in county towns and 
places below the county level declined by a relatively large 
margin. In particular, the total volume of the means of 
agricultural production sold to peasants during the year fell to 
1.29 billion yuan, down 6 percent. 
  The retail sales volume in the individual economic sector 
grew rapidly, while that in the collective economic sector 
declined. In 1993, the retail sales volume of the individual 
economy totalled 3.711 billion yuan, up 28.4 percent; that of 
the state-owned economy 4.899 billion yuan, up 7.5 percent; and 
that of the collective economy 2.628 billion yuan, down 4.1 
percent. The total volume of goods sold by peasants to 
nonagricultural residents was 1.861 billion yuan, up 28.8 
percent. The proportion of sales volume effected by individual 
economic sector and directly by peasants rose from 37.2 to 42.5 
percent. 
  Sales of commodities, food, clothing, and articles for daily 
use increased comprehensively and the growth tendency in 
clothing was conspicuous. In the retail sales volume of 
consumer goods, foodstuffs, clothes, and articles for daily use 
totalled 5.846, 2.307, and 3.679 billion yuan, up 12.9, 20.8, 
and 15.6 percent respectively. The ratio between them changed 
from 50.4:18.6:31.0 to 49.4:19.5:31.1 in 1993.

  The construction of rural bazaars progressed rapidly and the 
volume of transactions increased by a large margin. In 1993, 
the province raised funds through various channels to build 
rural bazaars and the financial input totalled 373 million yuan, 
of which 40.9 percent were raised from society. With the 94 
newly-built rural bazaars, the year-end figure numbered 2,718. 
The volume of business transactions amounted to 7.221 billion 
yuan, up 32.9 percent. Rapid growth was achieved by various 
specialized and wholesale markets for commodities such as 
medicine, poultry, eggs, fruit, grain, vegetables, small items, 
and so on. 
  Restricted by macroeconomic regulation and control, the 
purchases and sales in markets of the means of production 
presented a declining trend. In 1993, means of production 
bought and sold by material supply and marketing enterprises 
across the province amounted to 3.106 and 3.286 billion yuan, 
down 2.4 and 3.2 percent respectively. 
  Market prices rose sharply as prices in 1993 were the third 
highest in the past 15 years, after 1988 and 1989. The overall 
retail prices in the entire society rose by 14.8 percent and 
consumer goods rose 15 percent. The substantial price increases 
of food items, by 18.5 percent, was the major factor affecting 
the overall price level and their impact on the overall retail 
prices was 62.3 percent. Of these, grain prices rose by 46.6 
percent; edible oil 17.9 percent; meat, poultry, and eggs 25 
percent; sugar 28.9 percent; and aquatic products 12.7 percent. 
On the other hand, prices of fresh vegetables dropped by 2 
percent. The soaring prices of building and decoration 
materials and fuel was another major factor pushing retail 
prices upward. The prices of building and decoration materials 
rose by 31 percent and fuel by 41.1 percent. The extent of their 
impact on overall retail prices was 15 percent. Affected by the 
excessively rapid price rises in both food items and services 
charges, the margin of increase of residents' cost of living 
exceeded retail commodity prices. The overall level of urban 
and rural residents' cost of living rose by 16 percent, of which 
charges for service items including rent, water, electricity, 
communications, recreation, and so on went up by 19.1 percent. 
  The margin of price rises in rural areas was larger than in 
cities and towns. The overall retail prices in rural areas rose 
by 16.1 percent and those in cities and towns by 13.6 percent. 
The cost of living rose by 16.2 percent in rural areas while it 
went up by 15.8 percent in cities and towns. 
  Prices of the means of production increased universally. In 
1993, the production prices of industrial products rose by 18 
percent, of which those for industrial products such as the 
means of production rose by 28.3 percent. The purchase prices 
of major raw and semifinished materials, fuel, and power rose by 
44 percent. Of these, the prices of fuel and power rose by 36.9 
percent and those of ferrous metal rose by 83.6 percent. 
Judging from the principal types of the means of production, 
steel products, cement, and soft coal went up by 83, 77.9, and 
19.9 percent respectively. 
<H5>  VII. Foreign Trade, Economic Cooperation, and Tourism </H5>
  Persisting in the policy of promoting development with 
openness and fostering openness with development, the province 
lay firm hold of the construction of new hi-tech industrial 
development zones at the national level and economic development 
zones at the provincial level, positively conducted various 
tasks to solicit business and absorb funds from abroad and, 
through the coordinated actions of economic cooperation, trade, 
and tourism, extensively held various kinds of trade fairs and 
talks to quicken the pace of opening Guizhou to the outside 
world. 
  New breakthroughs were made in sports. At the Seventh 
National Games, 158 athletes from the province reached 18 
finals, in which they won four golds, three silvers, and one 
bronze medal. Participants in a total of 21 events finished 
between fourth and eighth places. The province's total of gold 
medals ranked 24th in the country and the collective score of 
114 points, ranked 27th, thus comprehensively achieving the 
objective of "increasing participation, increasing medals, 
raising scores, and raising places." The province staged 1,470 
sports meets at and above the county level with 430,800 athletes 
participating. In the major competitions at home and abroad, 
athletes from the province won 126 prizes including 18 gold, 25 
silver, and 14 bronze medals. Of these prizes, 12 were won in 
international competitions, 22 athletes broke 25 provincial 
records, and 12 athletes broke 14 adolescent provincial records. 
A total of 1,166,700 people reached the national standard of 
physical exercise, an increase of 45.6 percent. Of this total, 
102,600 people attained the superior class, up 39.3 percent, and 
six people reached the standard of national master sportsmen. 
<H5>  VIII. Social Insurance and Environmental Protection </H5>
  The insurance business was further expanded. Insurance 
premiums for the entire province reached 53.757 billion yuan and 
total income and expenditure for insurance services were 566 and 
307 million yuan, up 24.8 and 60.8 percent respectively. There 
were 186,900 claims with an indemnity of 182 million yuan paid 
for settled cases. 
  Social welfare undertakings developed rapidly. There are 
3,487 beds in 54 social welfare institutions run by civil 
affairs departments throughout the province, providing services 
to 1,696 people, increases of 46.8 and 9.9 percent respectively. 
The occupants in 866 homes for the aged run by urban and rural 
collective units totalled 6,039, an increase of 10.3 percent. 
In rural areas, 51,800 people were supported by collective 
units as individuals entitled to the treatment of "five 
guarantees." A total of 3.626 million people in financial 
difficulties received social relief from civil affairs 
departments. 
  New changes occurred in the labor markets. With increasingly 
wider and more numerous employment channels opening up, labor 
markets gradually advanced toward standardization, job search 
agencies sprung up, and a number of people were assigned jobs 
through labor departments. By the end of 1993, the total number 
of workers and staff members across the province was 2.356 
million. Of this total, those working in state-owned units 
numbered 1.94 million and those working under the contracted 
employment system reached 254,000, an increase of 4.3 percent 
and accounting for 10.8 percent of the entire workers and staff 
members. 
  New achievements were gained in environmental protection. In 
1993, there were 51 environmental monitoring stations and 1,310 
personnel under the provincial environmental protection 
department. During the year, 40 items of rectification of 
environment pollution were completed within limited periods and 
the financial input totalled 11.58 million yuan. Sewage 
disposal charges collected amounted to 24.006 million yuan. 
Twenty soot-control zones, covering an area of 78 square km, 
and 15 noise-control zones, covering an area of 67 square km, 
were constructed in 1993. In addition, three projects were 
acknowledged as scientific and technological research results 
with regard to environmental protection at the provincial level. 
<H5>  IX. Population and Living Standards </H5>
  According to a sample survey on population changes, the 
province's birth rate in 1993 was 22.6 per mill, up 0.2 per mill 
points; the death rate was 8.5 per mill, down 0.2 per mill 
points; and the natural growth rate was 14.1 per mill, up 0.22 
per mill points. Calculated on this basis, the province's 
population by the end of 1993 totalled 34,086,900 people, up 
473,400. As the number of increased population was larger than 
that of the previous year, the task of population control is 
still extremely arduous. 
  Along with the sustained growth of the national economy, and 
particularly with the accelerated development of the 
nonstate-owned economy in cities and towns as well as township 
and town enterprises in rural areas, the channels of residents' 
income were broadened. In the meantime, the people's living 
environment and facilities had also improved. According to a 
sample survey on urban and rural families, the per capita income 
used by urban residents as living expenses was 2,006.53 yuan, up 
22.5 percent, an actual increase of 5.8 percent after allowing 
for price rises. The per capita expenditure was 1,876.24 yuan, 
up 19.9 percent over 1992. The expenses for clothing items and 
daily necessities showed relatively greater increases of 21.9 
and 21.8 percent respectively, 6.7 and 6.6 percentage points 
higher than food items. The expenses for purchasing or building 
houses increased by 100 percent because real estate became a 
consumption hot spot among urban residents. The peasant per 
capita net income was 579.67 yuan, up 73.54 yuan or 14.5 
percent, which represented an actual increase of 2.7 percent 
after allowing for price rises. The net income derived from 
tertiary industry was 57.78 yuan, up 1.4 times, and peasant per 
capita cash payments came to 518.70 yuan, up 13.2 percent. Of 
this, payments used in production and as living expenses were 
137.44 yuan and 264.40 yuan, up 13.3 and 14.3 percent 
respectively. The margin of increase for urban and rural 
residents' income in 1993 was the largest since the beginning of 
the Eighth Five-Year Plan. However, further enhancement of the 
living standards of some urban and rural residents was affected 
due to the excessively rapid increases in the overall retail 
price level and the residents' cost of living during the 
corresponding period.
