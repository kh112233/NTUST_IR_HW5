FT  24 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Metal and bone join forces
It sounds at first like an unlikely investment for a Japanese metals
company: Kobe Steel's European venture capital arm is to take a 33 per cent
stake in Promotus, a Swiss company developing a bio-material for bone
implants and artificial hip joints.
But Kobe is itself a manufacturer of conventional metal hip joints and is
attracted by the potential of Promotus's new material, Proplast. It is soft
and extremely porous - made from an open matrix of PTFE (a high performance
plastic) coated with hydroxyapatite (the mineral in bone).
The Promotus implant has a coating of Proplast over the metal stem that fits
into the central cavity of the patient's thigh bone. This has two advantages
over conventional hard implants, according to the company: it acts like a
shock-absorber, allowing natural 'micro-motion' to take place in the
artificial joint; and it encourages the body's own connective tissues to
grow into the stem and make it more stable.
