  [Text] An official media spokesman has expressed surprise 
at some of the foreign media coverage of current developments in 
Yemen, which he said used inexact phrases that do not fit the 
new political and geographical reality in the united Yemen. 
These media organizations, he said, speak of a conflict between 
north and south and northern and southern forces, while, in 
reality, there is a single state and a single constitutional 
legitimacy. The military operations in some governorates of the 
Republic of Yemen are not pitting two systems of government or 
two states against each other. They are confrontations between 
the regular forces of the united government of Yemen and 
secessionist rebels defying legitimacy and law and order. 
  The spokesman said he regretted that certain Arab media are 
making the same mistake, using the same phrases that reflect the 
former state of division, which existed before 22 May 1990, 
after which date Yemen was reunified and the Republic of Yemen 
proclaimed. The spokesman hoped the media, particularly the 
Arab, would be more accurate and observe the official 
designations.
