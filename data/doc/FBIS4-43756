  [Excerpt] This year's 30th Cherry Festival in Tekirdag 
turned into a bloodbath. A bomb exploded at Tarsal tourist 
installations where a part of the festival was being held. 
Twelve persons were injured, one of them seriously. No one was 
killed. The explosion, which occurred at Tarsal's cocktail 
lounge at 2115, created a great panic at the crowded beach. 
  The police officials said it was a fragmentation bomb and 
that investigation into the case is continuing. No organization 
has yet assumed responsibility. [passage omitted]
