  [Excerpt] Cairo/Tripoli (DPA) -- According to Western 
diplomats in Tripoli, the Libyan authorities have released the 
bodies of an official of the German Federal Office for the 
Protection of the Constitution [BfV] and his wife after carrying 
out an autopsy. They are now to be brought to Germany as 
quickly as possible, diplomats in the Libyan capital told DPA in 
reply to a telephone inquiry on Wednesday [20 April]. 
  According to the results of the investigations so far, the 
Libyan auth orities assume that the couple fell victim 
to a robbery. However, investigations have not yet been 
concluded. At the moment, there are no indications of any 
connection between the man's violent death and his work as 
section head in Department 6 of the BfV. This department deals 
with foreigner extremism and international terrorism. 
  Robberies of tourists have increased, a Western diplomat 
said. However, it is unclear whether the victims were indeed 
robbed. Money and Eurocheques were found on them. 
  Circles of Western intelligence services operating in the 
Middle East have said that it is extremely unlikely that Mr. 
Becker was engaged in covert investigations in Libya. However, 
one cannot rule out that there was indeed a link between 
Becker's work and the motive for the deed, such as an act of 
revenge. [passage omitted]
