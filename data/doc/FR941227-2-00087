Background




Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort
the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery
Plans describe actions necessary for the conservation of the species, establish criteria for the recovery levels
for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice, and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comments period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

The Florida Manatee, a subspecies of the West Indian manatee, was originally listed under the Endangered Species
Act on March 11, 1967. The Service developed an initial recovery plan for manatees in 1980. The 1980 plan focused primarily,
but not exclusively, on manatees in Florida. In 1986 the Service adopted a separate Recovery Plan for manatees in Puerto
Rico. To reflect new information and planning needs for manatees in Florida, the Service revised the original plan
in 1989 focusing exclusively on Florida's manatees. The revised plan covered a five-year planning period ending
in Fiscal Year 1994. In view of progress since 1989 and planning needs beyond 1994, the Service is once again updating
and revising the plan.


West Indian manatees are also protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1461


et seq.

). This Act establishes the objective of continued maintenance of the health and stability of marine ecosystems,
and whenever consistent with this primary objective, obtaining and maintaining optimum sustainable populations
of marine mammals. It also establishes a moratorium, with certain exceptions, on harassing, hunting, capturing,
killing, or attempting to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal. Section 115(b) requires that conservation
plans be developed for marine mammals, including West Indian manatees, considered ``depleted'' under the Act. The
purpose of conservation plans is to identify actions needed to restore species or populations to optimum sustainable
population levels as defined under the Act. The revised recovery plan meets this planning requirement.
