METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ROBBERY DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF MURDER 
Two armed-robbery defendants are responsible for the 1988 murder of an 
Inglewood police sergeant even though they are not charged with pulling the 
trigger, the prosecuting attorney argued in Torrance Superior Court on Friday. 
Joevone Elster, 23, and Van Otis Wilson, 22, both of Los Angeles, face 25 years 
to life for first-degree murder and robbery charges in the March 31, 1988, 
shooting death of Inglewood Police Sgt. George Aguilar. 
Police say the bullet that killed Aguilar -- the first Inglewood police officer 
to be murdered in the line of duty in the department's 81-year history -- was 
fired by Leslie Holget, also of Los Angeles. Police say Holget died after 
shooting himself at the end of a 45-mile chase that led police to Newhall. 
A 15-year veteran who worked as an undercover narcotics officer, Aguilar was 
shot while in a high-speed chase of suspects in the armed robbery of a Los 
Angeles gas station money courier. 
Four defendants -- including Elster and Wilson -- were charged with robbing 
Masih Modani, the courier, of about $2,000. Because Aguilar was killed while 
investigating the robbery, all four defendants faced murder charges. 
One of the defendants, a 15-year-old, has been found guilty of first-degree 
murder and sentenced to the California Youth Authority until he is 25. Patrick 
Anthony Carr has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and agreed to testify 
in the trial of Elster and Wilson. He is awaiting sentencing.
