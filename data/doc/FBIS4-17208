  [Text] In accordance with the treaty on conventional 
weapons in Europe, a team of U.S., Norwegian and Danish military 
experts visited the garrisons of Russia's Northern Fleet. 
Representatives of the department for treaty implementation 
Captain Aleksandr Arbatov reports that military inspectors have 
visited the coast-guard division, located in the village of 
Lesnaya Rechka and the aviation regiment in the village of 
Katunino in the Arkhangelsk Region, where they were informed of 
the dislocation of the units and their strength and armaments. 
  This is NATO's third inspection mission to be carried out in 
the Northern Fleet since the conclusion of the treaty on 
conventional weapons in Europe and the Vienna document. After 
the treaty on the reduction of strategic offensive weapons goes 
into effect, military inspectors will visit the Northern Fleet's 
nuclear facilities in Severomorsk. The date of the visit has 
not been fixed yet.
