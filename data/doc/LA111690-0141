SCHOOL WORKERS WIN NEW CONTRACT 
The Newport-Mesa Unified School District board this week approved a new 
contract for its classified employees for the 1990-91 school year. 
The contract covers the district's nearly 800 full- and part-time non-certified 
employees in positions including maintenance and custodial workers, bus drivers 
and administrative support staff. 
Salaries will be increased by 5.27%, retroactive to July 1, raising the average 
monthly pay of classified employees from $1,932 to $2,037, according to Carol 
Stocker, the district's chief negotiator. The district is also covering the 
increased cost of health-care benefits and reducing the amount of time required 
to earn vacation time. 
In all, the compensation package will cost the district 8.06% more than last 
year and is a result of five months of negotiations between the district and 
the union that represents classified employees during contract talks.
