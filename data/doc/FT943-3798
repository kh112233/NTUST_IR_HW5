FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (13): The business visitor fares
best - The tourism industry's struggle to overcome a number of obstacles
Tourism in the Philippines might be described as optimism in the face of
adversity.
Superficially, there is every reason for visitors to be deterred. Until the
late-1980s, the political climate was unstable. Continuing 'internal
security' problems - from the activities of Muslim separatists in the
southern island of Mindanao, to random street crime - attract enough
international attention to give the Philippines a serious image problem.
Countries like the UK or Australia still provide consular advice notices to
travellers, despite requests from Filipino government officials to have
these warnings lifted.
The country also encounters more than its fair share of natural disasters.
Parts of the northern Luzon region, for example, were badly affected by the
1991 earthquake, in which over 2,000 people died.
Even in Manila's grander hotels, visitors will find that the standard fire
notices carry a separate, equally prominent, warning about earthquakes. 'If
unable to go down the stairs, go up to the roof,' reads one soothing, if
unhelpful, message.
The country averages over a dozen typhoons in a good year, some of which
have caused major damage in potential tourist centres in the Visayas.
If these factors fail to deter the more intrepid traveller, there is the
paucity of infrastructure, which is more annoying that exhilarating. In the
early-1990s, power-cuts were a feature of everyday life. Telephone
communications can still be erratic, and a trip around Metro Manila, the
country's major urban centre, means one long traffic-jam.
Yet, despite all of these obstacles, the Philippines is plainly aware of the
benefits which a flourishing tourist trade can bring, and is keen to play up
its limited gains. In 1993, 1.4m visitors arrived in the country, a 19 per
cent improvement on the previous year. The percentage gain in 1992 was of
the same order.
According to Mr Vicente Carlos, secretary at the department of tourism
(DoT), the country now seeks to attract around 1.65m visitors in 1994, and
2m in 1995. He takes comfort from the fact that the most recent monthly
figures - for May - showed that around 100,000 people arrived, a record
number for what is traditionally a lean month.
But while these statistics may provide grounds for encouragement, they
should also be kept in perspective. For a start, the Philippines is moving
off an exceptionally low base. Other centres in the Asia-Pacific region, for
example, notch up many times these numbers. Hong Kong, tiny in comparison,
attracts around 10m visitors a year.
Moreover, it is not entirely clear how many of the 1.4m arrivals in 1993
were 'expatriate' Filipinos returning to see their families. Just under
one-fifth of visitors emanate from the US. According to the DoT in Manila,
anyone holding a US 'green card' counts as an 'overseas worker', and only
Filipinos who have taken up US citizenship should fall into the North
American visitor category. But no one believes that these niceties are
scrupulously observed.
Nevertheless, as Mr Vicente stresses, 1993's 1.4m figure does better
anything the Philippines has achieved in the past. Moreover, he claims that
departmental statistics show that visitors average a fairly lengthy nine-day
stay, and spend quite highly during that time. This, he says, makes tourism
the second largest earner of foreign exchange for the Philippines - after
remittances from overseas workers. The industry accounts for about 5 per
cent of gross domestic product.
Clearly, the relatively stable political climate has been one major factor
in improving the sector's fortunes. Basic infrastructure improvements, like
the more secure electricity supply, are another.
A third, and less self-evident, reason for the upturn may be the fact that
tourists can now skirt Manila, and take direct international flights into
provincial cities like Cebu. Apart from a sleazy sex industry and an
intriguing golf-course built over the moat of the old walled town, Manila
has little to offer the overseas visitor who is there for reasons other than
business. Its international terminal, while functional, is discouragingly
dilapidated; the domestic terminal is accepted as a national disgrace.
Business travellers are better served: the Makati district, the city's main
financial and commercial centre, has recently added a number of new luxury
hotels, while the old-established Peninsular is undergoing renovation.
Asked what the Philippines can capitalise on as it pursues the tourism road,
Mr Vicente points to the country's beaches, the opportunities for activities
like scuba-diving, the fact that English is widely-spoken, and its people's
well-deserved reputation for friendliness and conviviality. The primary aim,
he says, is to attract some the intra-Asia tourist trade - notably from
Taiwan and Japan - with European travellers potential extra. Already
visitors from East Asia (as opposed to the Asean countries) account for
about 40 per cent of total visitors.
There is some evidence that the commercial sector is heeding the message,
and putting its money behind the official policy. A number of big Asian
property group or conglomerates - including the Philippines' Ayala Land
Corporation and Malaysia's Kuok group - have either been developing resort
sites in the area or have plans to do so. The Manila Hotel, an impressive
complex overlooking the bay and used by General Eisenhower as his
headquarters during the war, may also go up for privatisation, and interest
is reported already to be pronounced.
But, despite all the fine words, the tourist authorities have a thin
promotional budget, and know they are competing against heavy-spending
neighbours. To date, the most visable product of their efforts has been the
hosting of the Miss Universe contest earlier this year. A promotional show
in Paris is promised for the autumn, to coincide with President Ramos' visit
to the French capital.
