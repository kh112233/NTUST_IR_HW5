FT  21 OCT 92 / Jobs boost for west Belfast
FURTHER details emerged in the US yesterday about one of west Belfast's most
significant employment boosts for years.
Belfast MPs Dr Joe Hendron and Mr Cecil Walker reached a provisional
agreement with senior executives of the National Semi-Conductor Corporation,
one of the top US electronics groups, for it to buy microchips made at the
west Belfast plant of BCO Technologies (Northern Ireland). The project is
being supported by the Industrial Development Board, and offers hopes of 400
new jobs.
