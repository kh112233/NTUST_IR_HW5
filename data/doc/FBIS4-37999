  [Text] Jordan and Israel have agreed to open three joint 
border crossings: one between Elat and al-'Aqabah; one in the 
'Arava, linking southern Jordan and Beersheba; and one in the 
Bet She'an area, linking Irbid and Tiberias. 
  Foreign diplomatic sources in Israel told our correspondent 
that an agreement in principle was reached in a recent meeting 
King Husayn held with Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister 
Peres in Elat. 
  Jordan expressed its wish to set up direct links with Israel 
without the Palestinians, and the opening of these border 
crossings is an expression of that policy. Israeli sources said 
agreement has so far been reached only on the opening of the 
crossing between Elat and al-'Aqabah, and that while the other 
crossings are on the agenda, they have still not come up in 
actual talks.
