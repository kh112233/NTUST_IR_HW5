WORLD; 
SISTER SEES HOPE FOR HOSTAGES 
The sister of the longest-held Western hostage in Lebanon said today as she 
ended a pilgrimage to Europe and the Middle East that she believes the 
atmosphere is right for the release of all 18 captives. 
"I think that this is the beginning of the end," said Peggy Say, sister of 
Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent of the Associated Press. 
"It might not happen tomorrow, it might not happen next week, but when it 
happens, I believe it's going to be all of them, and I would rather see all the 
hostages come out next month than see Terry Anderson come out today alone," 
Peggy Say told British Broadcasting Corp. television. 
Say is especially optimistic because she believes that for the first time since 
Anderson was seized nearly five years ago, the three key nations -- the United 
States, Syria, and Iran -- are working together to try to free the hostages.
