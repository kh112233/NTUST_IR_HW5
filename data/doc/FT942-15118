FT  16 APR 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Win some, lose some
Is a company called Consolidated Tin Mines of Burma Ltd still trading? I
inherited 850 ordinary shares in 1958. Are they worth anything? I have also
inherited 300 ordinary shares in London &amp; Associated Investment Trust Ltd.
Is it still in business?
Consolidated Tin Mines of Burma Ltd was dissolved on December 31 1976. We
suspect the shares are valueless. At the time of writing, shares in London &amp;
Associated Investment Trust Ltd were trading at 42 1/4 p. (Answer by Murray
Johnstone).
