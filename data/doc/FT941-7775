FT  23 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Tomato war ends as market is sliced up
The transatlantic tomato war is over. Zeneca, the UK biosciences company,
and its US foes, Calgene and Campbell Soup, have negotiated a comprehensive
settlement of their long-standing dispute over patents for genetically
engineered non-squashy tomatoes.
The three companies have agreed how to slice up the market for so-called PG
tomatoes, which last longer than the natural fruit without rotting. These
are expected to take a substantial segment of the Dollars 11bn (Pounds
7.5bn) a year world market for tomatoes, because they can be picked ripe and
still reach the supermarket or processing plant in good condition.
Calgene, a Californian biotechnology company, will have exclusive worldwide
rights to fresh PG tomatoes. It is ready to sell these in the US under the
Flavr Savr trademark.
Zeneca and Campbell will share world rights to use PG tomatoes for processed
foods such as paste, soups and ketchup. These are likely to reach the US
market late in 1995, according to Zeneca.
Mr Simon Best, manager of Zeneca's fruit and vegetables business, said the
UK company was happy to give up the fresh PG market 'because we are
developing alternative technologies to achieve a tomato that will keep for
longer with a better flavour.'
The dispute arose because Zeneca and Calgene (with funding from Campbell)
independently developed the same genetic method for blocking the PG enzyme
which makes tomatoes soften as they ripen.
Zeneca's attempt to squash the Calgene patent made Mr Roger Salquist,
Calgene chief executive, see red. 'I didn't spend Dollars 95m in research in
order to give it away to some bozos from Great Britain,' he was quoted as
saying in 1992.
Now the companies are regrouping to fight a common enemy - the anti-biotech
activists who see the PG tomato as a target in their battle against
genetically engineered food.
