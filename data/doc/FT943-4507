FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: British Biotech breakthrough
British Biotechnology, one the UK's largest biotechnology companies,
yesterday claimed it had made a breakthrough in developing a drug to treat
acute pancreatitis, a condition with no effective cure at present, writes
Tim Burt.
Shares in the group rose 6p to 461p after the group said preliminary tests
showed the drug - lexipafant - was an effective remedy and, if fully
developed, could exploit a market worth an estimated Pounds 300m a year.
'Given the high margins in this business, it could turn the company round,'
said Mr James Noble, finance director.
The group is about to embark on Phase Three clinical trials of the drug and
expects to seek regulatory approval to market it before the end of 1996. It
is also on course in developing a new anti-cancer drug - Batimastat - which
could be the world's first oral treatment for cancer sufferers
Shares in Anagen climbed 17p to 65p yesterday after the biotechnology
company received clearance from the US Food and Drug administration to
market Auraflex, its automated immunoassay system.
The system can be used to measure the presence of infectious diseases,
monitor cancers and make fertility assessments.
