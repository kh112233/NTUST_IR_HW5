SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The inventions available for licensing are:



NIST Docket NO. 91007 




Title:

 X-Ray Photoelectron Emission Spectrometry System.



Description:

 New NIST technology using x-ray photoelectron emission spectroscopy makes it possible to obtain depth information
on chemical species located 1 to 5 nanometers beneath a material surface. The technique eliminates distortions in
the data which may result from changes in position between the sample and electron spectrometer during analysis.
It also takes advantage of the x-ray reflectivity of the sample.



NIST Docket No. 92049




Title:

 Faraday Effect Magnetic Field Sensor.


Description:

 NIST researchers have successfully demonstrated a flux-concentration technique for enhancing the sensitivity
of magneto-optic magnetic field sensors. The resulting Faraday effect sensor is 200 times more sensitive than the
magneto-optic material alone.



NIST Docket No. 93024




Title:

 Piezoelectric Linear Stepping Motor.


Description:

 The NIST ``Miliped'' is a piezo driven linear stepping motor that uses a novel application of the expansion properties
of piezo ceramics coupled with a novel motor housing. This design provides greater clamping/driving force in a robust
and stiff actuator that is easily manufactured. Range of travel is limited only by housing length with a minimum step
size limited only by the quality of the power supply.



NIST Docket No. 93053




Title:

 Thin Film High Temperature Silicide Thermocouples.


Description:

 The invention includes a method of preparing a thin film metal silicide thermoelements for thermocouples with superior
durability in air at 700900 degrees Celsius and thermocouples made using this structure.



NIST Docket No. 93072C




Title:

 Multiple Memory Self-Organizing Pattern Recognition Network.


Description:

 A NIST neural network has been developed which allows patterns to be filtered, recognized, and classified with no
prespecified class or filtering information. The technology allows adaptive, high accuracy, parallel classification
of complex noisy patterns from a small set of training examples.
