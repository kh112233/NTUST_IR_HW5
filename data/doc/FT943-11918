FT  28 JUL 94 / 'PVC cartel' fines reimposed
The European Commission yesterday reimposed fines on 12 chemicals companies
for an alleged plastics price-fixing cartel during the early 1980s. The move
followed a decision last June by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg
to overturn fines previously imposed to punish a cartel in polyvinyl
chloride (PVC). The court threw out the fines because of translation
differences between the German, English and French texts of the Commission's
decision on the cartel. The textual differences invalidated the entire legal
process, the court said. The Commission has reimposed fines worth a total of
Ecu23.5m (Pounds 18.5m) against BASF, Hoechst, Wacker Chemie, and Huls of
Germany; Imperial Chemical Industries and Shell International Chemical of
the UK; DSM of the Netherlands; Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij of Belgium;
Enichem and Montedison of Italy; and Elf Atochem and Societe Artesienne de
Vinyl of France. The fines on Solvay of Belgium and Norsk Hydro were not
affected by the court's decision. ICI said yesterday it would be appealing.
The Commission alleges a cartel was started at the end of 1980. Delegates
from the companies met on a monthly basis, normally in Zurich, when they
discussed quotas, monthly sales in each country, and pan-European prices.
