  [Text] Russian military experts monitoring the 
dismantlement of two naval nuclear reactors at Paldiski, Estonia 
will leave it by August 31, when the last Russian troops 
withdraw from Estonia. 
  Reporting this in the National Assembly on Monday, Estonia's 
Foreign Minister Juri Luik explained that the operation would 
subsequently be controlled by Estonian specialists and estimated 
the cost of dismantling the reactors at this former USSR naval 
base 30 kilometers west of Tallinn at about 10 million dollars. 
  The money is expected to be raised through donations from 
various international sources. 
  But so far only five million dollars have come mainly from 
U.S. the Estonian side, Luik said, is ready to pay only for 
organizing dosimetric control, conducting rescue work in 
emergencies, and maintaining law and order in areas close to the 
nuclear facilities. In Luik's opinion, Russia is to compensate 
for the 8 million krons spent by Estonia to lay a special 7 
kilometer rail track to evacuate the reactors.
