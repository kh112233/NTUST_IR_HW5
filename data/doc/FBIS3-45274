  [Text] Hong Kong, Jan 14 (AFP)--Zhou Duo, a major figure 
in the 1989 democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, 
has quietly returned to China after more than a year abroad, 
human rights sources said Friday. 
  Zhou, 45, an economist, crossed into the neighboring city of 
Shenzhen -- apparently without hindrance -- on Wednesday after 
spending six days with friends in Hong Kong, the sources said. 
He was expected to proceed to Beijing. 
  Zhou had been abroad for 14 months, travelling through 
Europe, including Russia, and the United States. 
  Much of his time was spent at Harvard University, where he 
"voraciously" read Chinese books banned or otherwise unavailable 
in the People's Republic, one of the sources said. 
  Zhou was among four dissidents -- another was Taiwan pop 
singer Hou Dejian -- who staged a hunger strike just before the 
Chinese army shot its way into Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. 
  He was subsequently jailed for 10 months without charge, 
then 
detained for another 18 days on the first anniversary of the 
massacre. 
  Another Tiananmen veteran, labor activist Han Dongfang, 
remains stranded in Hong Kong -- despite repeated attempts to go 
home -- after being expelled from China in August following a 
year in the United States.
