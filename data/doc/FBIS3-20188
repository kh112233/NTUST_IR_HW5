<F P=106> [Statement by Kani Yilmaz, PKK representative for Europe and </F>
spokesman of PKK Secretary General 'Abdullah Ocalan, "over the 
weekend"; place not given -- recorded; Yilmaz statements in 
unidentified language with superimposed German translation] 
  [Text] On behalf of the Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK], 
I want to tell the German public and the German people the 
following: We are not at all interested in creating problems in 
Germany, that is, to disturb the Germans, establish street 
barricades, or create unrest. I think that there would have 
been no riots if the police had not provoked the masses. 
  Let me now come to the question of whether the PKK organized 
these actions. The PKK did not plan these actions, but the PKK 
supports the people's actions, which were right. 
  I want to say the following about our relations with 
Germany. 
We also have a relevant message, that is, an instruction from 
our Secretary General 'Abdullah Ocalan. To eliminate all 
existing problems and prevent negative consequences, we are 
prepared to discuss the problems with the FRG Government. In 
concrete terms, we do not have any prejudice against the FRG 
Government. This is the first thing. Second, if the democratic 
rights that are due to the Kurdish people, for example, the 
right to demonstrate, the organization of cultural events, and 
the right of assembly, are not restricted in any way, we are in 
exchange prepared to eliminate existing problems, that is, 
actions regarded as disturbing here in Germany, in a joint 
action through consultations with the FRG Government. 
  Finally, I want to say that the PKK has absolute authority 
over the Kurdish people and, also that the people are backing 
its leadership.
