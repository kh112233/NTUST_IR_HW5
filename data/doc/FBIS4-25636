  [Text] The assistant director of the Hong Kong branch of 
China's official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Wang Rudeng, yesterday 
assured Hong Kong journalists that they would still enjoy press 
freedom after 1997. "The Chinese government and the XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY respect press freedom in Hong Kong," he said. "The 
problem of offending the Chinese government has never emerged." 
  Speaking to journalists after the opening of the Dragon Boat 
Festival, Mr Wang said the Chinese government had often assured 
Hong Kong that it would enjoy press freedom after 1997. "Even 
if the news criticises the Chinese government, it is all right." 
  But he said press freedom did not mean that journalists 
could 
fabricate reports. Commenting on the case of Xi Yang, the Ming 
Pao journalist who was sentenced to 12 years jail in Beijing in 
April, he said every journalist had to abide by the law. "If 
anyone, including journalists, offends the law, he will be 
punished," Mr Wang said. 
  He also said the recent dispute between the ATV management 
and the editorial office was an internal ATV matter. "It is not 
related to press freedom," he said.
