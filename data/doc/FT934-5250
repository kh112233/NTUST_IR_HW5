FT  30 NOV 93 / Iranian aircraft hijacked
An unidentified Iranian yesterday hijacked a government aircraft with 38
people on board during a domestic flight in Iran then surrendered after it
landed in southern Iraq, AP reports from Nicosia.
The Iraqi news agency, INA, said the male hijacker gave himself up six hours
after the twin-prop Fokker Friendship F-27, owned by Iran's Oil Ministry,
landed in the Iraqi port city of Basra.
It did not say whether the hijacker was armed, or if any of the passengers
were hurt in the ordeal. INA also did not say what the hijacker's demands
were, except that he requested asylum in Iraq or any other country.
The hijacker's wife and five children were with him on the flight, INA said.
The agency said the aircraft landed in Basra following a request by Iranian
authorities. Iran's official news agency, IRNA, said Iranian officials had
requested that Iraq refuse to provide ground services for the hijacked
aircraft.
