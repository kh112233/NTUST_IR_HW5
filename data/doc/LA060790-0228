NATION; 
EX-PLAYMATE GUILTY IN TAX CASE 
A federal jury today convicted a former Playboy model on charges she failed to 
pay taxes on $398,000 she received to provide companionship to an elderly 
millionaire. 
The jury deliberated about 3 1/2 hours Wednesday evening and this morning 
before finding Leigh Ann Conley, 35, guilty on four misdemeanor counts of 
failing to file federal income tax returns. 
The conviction comes a month after her twin sister, Lynnette Harris, also a 
Playboy model, was found guilty of evading taxes on $686,000 she received from 
the same businessman, the late David Kritzik, who died last summer at age 89. 
The identical blonde twins appeared nude in Playboy magazine and in two films, 
"I, the Jury" and "Sorceress." 
Conley could be sentenced to four years in prison and $325,000 in fines.
