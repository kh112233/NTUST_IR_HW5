FT  24 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Extending help to the leaning
tower
The leaning tower of Pisa is not only leaning, it's also revolving according
to initial findings emerging from data collected by the UK-based Building
Research Establishment which is monitoring the tower's movements for the
Italian authorities.
BRE has installed electrolevels, originally developed for aircraft
navigation, to detect movements of the tower, some of which have not been
observed before.
An electrolevel consists of a glass phial containing an electrolytic fluid
and three electrodes, spaced at equal distances along its length. As the
phial tilts, the quantities of fluid between the electrodes change and the
electrical resistance between them is altered. The gives a measure of the
rotation.
When work to stabilise the tower begins, the data from the BRE instruments
will be used to give early warning of any changes in the tower's tilt. BRE:
