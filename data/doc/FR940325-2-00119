<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition from the Environmental Investigation Agency to
suspend the import of African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, and Benin to the United States under the
Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (WBCA). The Service has reached a final decision on the petition and determines
that sufficient information exists to suspend the importation of African grey parrots (

Psittacus erithacus

 and all subspecies) from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, and Guinea. Information the Service has gathered, including
the petition, supports the suspension of the import of African grey parrots under the WBCA, in the interest of conservation
of the species. However, because a statutorily mandated moratorium on importation of this species became effective
on October 23, 1993, except as allowed pursuant to regulations which the Service has promulgated, no additional prohibition
on importation of this species is necessary. The Service notes however that it is required under the WBCA to issue and
publish notice of the final decision reached on this petition. The Service will take into account its decision on this
petition in reviewing any future applications for the importation of African grey parrots from C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire,
Togo, Benin, and Guinea to the United States under the WBCA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 23, 1992, the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA) of 1992 (16 U.S.C. 49014916) was signed into law.
The purposes of the WBCA include promoting the conservation of exotic birds by: ensuring that all imports into the
United States of species of exotic birds are biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring
that imported birds are not subject to inhumane treatment; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs
in countries of origin. 



Pursuant to Section 105(b) of the WBCA (16 U.S.C. 4904), ``Emergency Authority to Suspend Imports of Listed Species,''
the WBCA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to suspend the importation of exotic birds of any species that is
listed in any Appendix to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES,
or Convention), if the Secretary determines that: 

(A)(i) Trade in that species is detrimental to the species, 

(ii) There is not sufficient information available on which to base a judgment that the species is not detrimentally
affected by trade in that species, or
