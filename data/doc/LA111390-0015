VOTERS OK OF TERM LIMITS 
I found Robert Presley's lament most entertaining. The passage of Proposition 
140 does not necessarily indicate that the majority of the people of California 
have lost faith in the professionalism of their legislators. 
It just might, however, indicate that the people have come to believe their 
legislators have been just a little too professional at the wrong things, i.e., 
collecting honorariums, soliciting bribes, selling votes and attending 
fund-raisers while allowing "immense social and economic problems" to go 
unsolved and even unaddressed. Frankly, the legislators of the California 
Assembly and Senate have only themselves to thank for the passage of 
Proposition 140.
