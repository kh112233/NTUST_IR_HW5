FT  08 MAY 93 / World News in Brief: Legionnaire's checks
Westminster City Council has ordered Trafalgar Square's fountains to be
turned off and all water cooling towers in the Piccadilly Circus and
Leicester Square areas of London to be inspected after the death of a man
from Legionnaire's Disease last month. The dead man and two people who
recovered from the disease had been in the area in the 10 days before the
onset of symptoms.
