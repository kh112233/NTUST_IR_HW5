FT  09 NOV 93 / Castro turns eye to tourism potential
PRESIDENT Fidel Castro of Cuba has said that efforts by the US to isolate
the country through an economic embargo are instead isolating US business,
which is missing investment opportunities in the Caribbean island.
In several weekend statements, Mr Castro also said that Cuban workers were
not efficient enough and praised foreign investors in Cuba for increasing
productivity in several sectors, including tourism.
He told a group of foreign businessmen investment opportunities in Cuba were
worth many billions of dollars and that tourism alone had the potential for
Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.5bn) in new foreign business.
Opportunities for foreign investment in Cuba were growing so quickly that
there would be 'not one square metre of beach' left for US companies.
'Those who impose a blockade impose a blockade on themselves,' he said.
Speaking to a conference of Communist party delegates, Mr Castro said his
government was committed to expanding the tourism sector, as it was the only
economy activity which could ease Cuba's economic problems.
The Cuban economy has been under severe strain following the break-up of the
Soviet Union, the island's former benefactor, and a poor sugar harvest.
