MILKEN'S SENTENCE 
Milken is lucky he lives in the United States. In three to six years, he will 
go home a free man and a millionaire as well. 
Even if much of his billion-dollar empire is liquidated by legal expenses, 
fines and operating costs, a few million remaining in 1993 or even 1996 would 
still ensure a reasonable and comfortable lifestyle as compared with working 
people making $35,000 or even $50,000 a year. 
His 10-year sentence is hardly a deterrent. History has shown that no matter 
what punishment is extracted by the law, it does not deter similar crimes in 
the future. Crimes are motivated by greed, anger, revenge and other compelling 
factors. Even if he were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole, some other junk-bond clone would emerge to do as he had done -- or even 
worse.
