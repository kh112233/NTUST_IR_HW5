FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major challenges Kinnock over policy on
private care
THE TORIES sought to regain the initiative on health yesterday as Mr John
Major called on Labour's leadership to make clear its attitude towards
private health care and accused the party of 'shroud-waving'.
Visiting York District Hospital, the prime minister challenged Labour over
the thrust of its election broadcast - that people who paid for private
health care could be treated more quickly than if they used the National
Health Service.
Such a charge was 'inaccurate unless they (Labour) are going to say that
they are going to stop all private health care', he said. 'If this is what
they are going to say, then let them say it, and say it clearly.' Ending
private health care would reduce the total amount of health care available,
'ensuring that queues in the National Health Service rise', he added.
Mr Major said that previous examples of individual emotive cases produced by
Labour had not lived up to the claims made about them. 'They have been
shroud-waving in one form or another for a long time and case after case
that has been examined has not been what it was held out to be in the first
instance,' he said.
Mr Major's visit to York hospital, which will become a self-governing trust
next week, was arranged to coincide with the BMA conference, which the
Tories had predicted would be hostile to the health reforms.
The prime minister said that Labour's success in the opinion polls on the
NHS argument did not reflect the real improvements that had been made. He
contrasted the small group of demonstrators he had met on his way into the
hospital with the work being carried out inside it.
'You saw people outside waving Labour placards but if they were in here
looking at what has happened in the health service, at the improvements in
care, perhaps the climate might be different,' he said.
