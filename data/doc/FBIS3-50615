  [Text] Colombian Public Health Minister Juan Luis Londono 
de la Cuesta is currently visiting Cuba. The minister and the 
delegation accompanying him will visit approximately eight 
health and research centers. Minister Londono today met with 
the Cuban Public Health Ministry directorate and Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina. Public Health Minister Londono told 
this newscast that his visit to Cuba is to: 
  [Begin Londono recording] Try to find channels for 
commercial 
trade that will allow us to improve our commercial relations 
between Colombia and Cuba and take advantage of the outstanding 
work you have developed in the field of health. We are going to 
try and gain knowledge of your contribution in the fields of 
pharmaceuticals, primary health care, and hospital care. We are 
trying to learn more and take advantage of the experience you 
have in these areas. [end recording] 
  Minister Londono also talked about the public health 
situation in Colombia. 
  [Begin Londono recording] In Colombia we have several 
problems. Perhaps the most important achievement is our 
reduction in the morbidity and mortality rate in transmitted 
diseases which are typical because of the poverty. We have been 
able to reduce these diseases considerably in the past 15 years. 
However, we are now, unfortunately, being affected by the 
trauma of violence in the country. More people are getting 
killed in Colombia than in any other country of the world. Not 
only are more people getting killed but the hospitals are 
constantly treating more and more wounded people. This has 
completely changed [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  Minister Juan Luis Londono and the delegation accompanying 
him will return to Colombia on 11 January.
