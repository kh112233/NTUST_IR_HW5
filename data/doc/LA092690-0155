NATION; 
WRONG MAN CONVICTED OF RAPE 
A landscaper has served three years and three months of a life prison term 
after being convicted of a 1986 rape-burglary he apparently did not commit, 
officials said today. 
Anthony Echols, 26, of Loganville, confessed Tuesday to a crime for which 
Willie Frank Williams was convicted in June, 1987, said Loganville Police Chief 
Eddy Sharpe. 
Williams was sentenced to life in prison for the rape of an elderly Loganville 
woman. 
Police picked up Echols after reopening the investigation some six weeks ago 
for reasons they have not revealed. 
Authorities are working on William's release from the Dodge County Correctional 
Institute in Chester, where he has served his time.
