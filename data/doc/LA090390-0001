SURROGATE PARENTING 
"Hard cases make bad law." We make law based on the normal case, not the 
exception. Surrogate contracts should be routinely viewed as valid and subject 
to normal contract law. 
The claim of Anna Johnson is clearly invalid. She is not a parent of the child, 
merely a baby-sitter or nurse for an extremely young child and prospective 
adopter if for some reason the parents were found not able or willing to raise 
their child. 
The Times feels it is somehow inhumane to view this as a contract. But not to 
do so is obviously inhumane. That would be to forbid people to arrange things 
in a manner they both find satisfactory. Nor do we clarify the legal picture by 
removing the profit motive. In fact, we remove one of the clearer standards 
from consideration and have to go by fuzzy ones. 
The Times' suggestion for a legislative approach clashes with its own 
acknowledgement that "writing rules to cover any contingency will be difficult, 
perhaps impossible." Our best course is largely to treat these rare cases as 
pure contract disputes. Surrogate parents are not a subject for some bureaucrat 
to foul up.
