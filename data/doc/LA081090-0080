REAGAN ADMINISTRATION OBSTRUCTED AGENT ORANGE STUDY, PANEL CLAIMS 
A House committee concluded Thursday that White House officials in the Ronald 
Reagan Administration "controlled and obstructed" a federal study of Agent 
Orange exposure among Vietnam veterans. 
The congressional panel said that a secret White House strategy to deny federal 
liability in toxic exposure cases led to the cancellation of the Centers for 
Disease Control study in 1987. 
The report by the House Government Operations Committee bolsters arguments of 
two veterans' groups, the American Legion and the Vietnam Veterans of America, 
which filed a lawsuit last week seeking to have the CDC resume its study of the 
health effects of Agent Orange exposure. 
"The White House compromised the independence of the CDC and undermined the 
study by controlling crucial decisions and guiding the course of research, at 
the same time it had secretly taken a legal position to resist demands to 
compensate victims of Agent Orange exposure . . . " the report said. 
Agent Orange was a herbicide used to destroy ground cover during the Vietnam 
War. It has been blamed by veterans' groups for 19 cancers and other health 
problems, including birth defects. 
Congress ordered the CDC study to determine which Vietnam veterans had been 
exposed to Agent Orange. It was to be used as a basis for other studies. 
The committee said the study should not have been canceled "because CDC did not 
document that exposure could not be assessed" and disregarded other methods of 
measuring exposure.
