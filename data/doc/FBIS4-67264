  [Text] Colon - More than 840 kg of cocaine was seized 
aboard the Panamanian-registered vessel Christian in the port of 
Coco Solo by the canine section of the Free Zone and the PTJ 
[Judicial Technical Police]. The photograph shows a large 
number of boxes that contained cocaine camouflaged by clothing, 
addressed to the Republic of Haiti as the port of destination. 
Investigations have determined, however, that the true final 
destination of the drug could be the port of Miami.
