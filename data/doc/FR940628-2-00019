<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. DOE established regional biomass program to promote the development of effective uses of bioenergy for energy.
The legislative authority directs U.S. DOE to ``carry out activities related to technology transfer, industry support,
resource assessment, and matching local resources to conversion technologies.'' The US DOE is seeking projects
that demonstrate bioenergy technologies which produce energy saving through displacement of non-renewable resources,
or that produce energy through the direct combustion of renewable resources. Projects will also be evaluated on their
ability to minimize environmental impacts and their ability to improve the economic viability of a specific bioenergy
industry or technology. Projects shall be located in the region consisting of the states Alaska, Washington, Oregon,
Montana and Idaho. All project sponsors will be required to provide a minimum cost sharing of 1:1. Acceptable demonstration
technologies will use one or more of the following biomass fuels: Landfill debris and landfill gas; logging residues;
agricultural crops and wastes; biomass farming; urban, forest, and forest products wood wastes; municipal solid
waste; animal wastes; and food processing wastes. Bioenergy projects can produce electricity, mechanical power,
space heat, and industrial process heat. The U.S. DOE plans to award up to 5 grants of approximately $100,000 for each
project. The U.S. DOE allocation for this program in FY 1994/95 is $450,000.
