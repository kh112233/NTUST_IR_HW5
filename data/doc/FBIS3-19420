"Liliana Ferraro Draws Conclusions From Aix Summit -- `A World 
Conference on the Mafia'"] 
  [Text] [Heuze] Following the French-Italian meeting in 
Aix-en-Provence, are you pleased with the ground covered by 
international collaboration against the Mafia? 
  [Ferraro] It is not always easy to measure the amount of 
ground covered. The countries involved in the discussions have 
very different crime situations. It is therefore normal that 
they take widely varying approaches to the phenomenon. Having 
said that, we have taken a great step forward, both on the 
bilateral level, at Aix, and on the level of the European 
Community in the working group on organized crime set up in 
association with the interior and justice ministers. 
  [Heuze] What is your opinion of Franco-Italian cooperation 
in 
this area? 
  [Ferraro] For a year and a half we have been working in 
close 
harmony. Michel Debach, a French judge, is permanently attached 
to the Criminal Affairs Department of our Justice Ministry. 
That has simplified relations between our two administrations 
and has made dossier processing more efficient and more 
flexible. The Aix meeting was also very productive. 
  [Heuze] In what respect? 
  [Ferraro] It is encouraging to note that major progress has 
been made in Europe in how this phenomenon, which unfortunately 
is not solely an Italian problem, is viewed. We have to 
understand that, when one country strengthens its fight against 
organized crime, as Italy has done for some time now, the 
Mafiosi can very easily set up in another country and continue 
their activities. That is a phenomenon requiring action from all 
the countries of Europe. 
  [Heuze] Not all criminals are Mafiosi, though... 
  [Ferraro] When we speak of the Mafia, we are referring to a 
group of criminals who organize themselves for criminal activity 
of whatever type. When you consider the aggressiveness of these 
organizations, in Italy and elsewhere, and the extent of their 
resources, you realize how much of a risk we would run by not 
immediately taking measures to try and curb their penetration. 
At Aix, for example, my colleagues explained that, due to the 
fact that we in Italy did not realize in time this scourge's 
extraordinary capacity for expansion, the Mafia was able to 
leave its traditional habitat (Sicily, Calabria, and the Naples 
region) and spread outward. 
  [Heuze] Do you believe that France is aware of this? 
  [Ferraro] I think that the measures that [French Justice 
Minister] Pierre Mehaignerie wants to implement are very 
important, such as judges specializing in organized crime and 
the creation of a centralized structure. 
  [Heuze] Italy has a whole legal arsenal designed to fight 
the 
Mafia. What are its main features? 
  [Ferraro] Firstly, there is the law of 1982 which 
establishes 
the notion of a "Mafia-type criminal association." Then there 
are the laws governing repentants, drugs -- enabling undercover 
operations -- and telephone bugging. Also, an anti-Mafia 
investigation department was set up which made it possible to 
assemble a body of specialist police officers in a centralized 
structure. Then there are all the legal adjustments that were 
adopted subsequently in the light of the constantly shifting 
crime situation. That was how we were able to sequester 
considerable Mafia assets. When you take a clan chief's money 
away from him, you remove almost all his power. We also spoke 
in Aix of the need to establish stricter penalties against 
people who have been prosecuted and found guilty of Mafia 
activity. 
  [Heuze] Do you want other European countries to bring their 
legislation in line with your laws? 
  [Ferraro] That is the main thing. It would also be good if 
the laws governing informers and the confiscation of property 
were adopted by other countries. 
  [Heuze] Is the Mafia present in France? 
  [Ferraro] Of course. Mafiosi -- mostly from the Camorra 
group -- have taken refuge is a number of regions. We have 
witnessed this through joint police operations such as the Green 
Tide operation. At Aix, Prefect Mancuso, the Naples prosecutor, 
reiterated that there had been links going back to 1984 between 
the Marseilles underworld and the Camorra. Moreover, since 
Michele Zeza was not just a Camorrist but also had ties with the 
Mafia, his presence on the Cote d`Azur was not just a 
coincidence -- as Judge Falcone said: "There are no coincidences 
in the Mafia" -- obviously he was there "on business." Each 
time there is an easy opportunity to make major property or 
capital investments, the dirty money rushes in. Knowledge of 
this phenomenon should force us to take steps in due course. 
  [Heuze] Do you think the Mafia was involved in the murder of 
Yann Piat? 
  [Ferraro] There are no clues to indicate that. Anyway, we 
did not touch on that specific subject at Aix. 
  [Heuze] Italy has proposed a UN conference on organized 
crime. What will be the aims of this conference? 
  [Ferraro] This conference will be held in Naples from 24 to 
26 October. It will not aim to examine the phenomenon of crime 
on a world scale, but should enable the world's governments to 
compare their legislations. Organized crime is the number-one 
enemy of democracy. It tries to take control on the ground and 
corrupt local authority and the financial markets. It aims at 
preventing democracies from autonomously governing public life. 
We propose making the world fight against the Mafia more 
incisive and examining together how we can prevent dirty money 
laundering. It will then be up to each government to implement 
the measures it deems necessary. The main thing is to face these 
problems on a world level.
