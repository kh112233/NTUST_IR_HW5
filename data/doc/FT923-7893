FT  14 AUG 92 / UN shies away from direct military intervention
THE two resolutions which were yesterday passed by the United Nations
Security Council authorise all necessary measures aimed at protecting the
humanitarian relief operation in Bosnia.
But they fall short of calling for explicit military involvement to protect
aid convoys, let alone as a means of halting the war or ending the process
of 'ethnic cleansing' in the former Yugoslav republic.
The two resolutions were backed by Britain, France, the US, Belgium and
Russia. But the text of the first resolution, left many countries,
particularly the Islamic, and east European states, dissatisfied.
'The point is that the first resolution, which authorises all necessary
measures to ensure the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies to Bosnia,
is an incremental step towards applying force,' a Nato diplomat said.
The second resolution, which deals specifically with violation of human
rights in Bosnia, strongly condemns the practice of 'ethnic cleansing.'
In the first resolution's original draft, drawn up by the US last week,
Washington wanted a specific reference to the government of Bosnia.
'A provisional resolution stipulated that all humanitarian efforts should be
performed in conjunction with the government of Bosnia-Hercegovina. But some
EC countries opposed this,' said a US diplomat. 'We wanted to give the
government of Bosnia some backing and recognition,' he added.
The final draft recognised the need to respect the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. But a Nato
diplomat described this article as 'an insult' to the Bosnian population.
'Entire villages have been destroyed. Tens of thousands have been forcibly
deported. Serbs have grabbed 70 per cent of the territory. Croatia has
grabbed some land as well. We should be talking about ways to reconstruct
the republic of Bosnia,' he added.
As a means of defending the republic of Bosnia, the Organisation of the
Islamic Conference (OIC), an umbrella for the 46 Islamic countries, and
which recently set up its own contact group or lobby at the UN, tried to
'give more teeth' to the first resolution, a Turkish diplomat at the UN
said.
'We wanted Bosnia to be excluded from the UN arms embargo imposed on all the
republics of the former Yugoslavia,' he said. 'Our amendments never made
their way into the Security Council.'
However, the implicit use of force is spelt out in article two of the first
resolution. It calls upon states to take ..all measures necessary to
facilitate ..the delivery of ..humanitarian assistance to Sarajevo and
wherever needed in other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
But Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the UN, said that the
precise interpretation of what is meant by 'all measures necessary' should
have been spelt out.
The reluctance by the west to intervene is also reflected in the second
resolution, which concerns the violation of human rights in Bosnia.
Article 3 demands that all authorities in the former Yugoslavia and all
military forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, immediately cease and desist from
all breaches of international humanitarian law ..
'How can we implement this article?' an Austrian diplomat asked. 'The Serbs
are armed to the teeth. I don't know how this clause will stop the
intimidation and killing which is taking place in those towns and villages
which are not visited by aid agencies, or the media. Without using force,
and its success is not even guaranteed, I don't know how we can make any
side comply.'
