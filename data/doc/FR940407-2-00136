SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Two indictments were returned on December 13, 1993, in the U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey. The first,
a five (5) count indictment, charging Rexon Technology Corporation, Gary D. Kauf, Jerome S. Shafir, James A. Bittel,
and Ronald L. Laib, with conspiracy (18 U.S.C. 371) to violate and violating section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act
(22 U.S.C. 2778) (AECA) and its implementing regulations, the ITAR. Second, a four (4) count indictment, charging
Ordnance Technologies, Ltd., John Paul Grecian, and Bryan Mason with conspiracy (18 U.S.C. 371) to violate and violating
section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) (AECA) and its implementing regulations, the ITAR. The indictment
charges that the defendants conspired to export illegally 300,000 sets of United States-origin fuze components
to Iraq, while stating that the fuzes in question were for use by the Jordanian Armed Forces, without having first obtained
the U.S. Department of State requisite authorization. Also, the defendant was charged with causing a false statement
to be made in applications to the Department of State for licenses to export those defense articles to Iraq by supplying
a cover story that stated the fuzes were going to be assembled in Jordan and used by the Jordanian Armed Forces. (
