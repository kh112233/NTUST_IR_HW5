FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: VideoLogic predicts higher interim losses
of over Pounds 3.5m
VideoLogic, the electronics company demerged four months ago from Avesco,
the broadcast equipment and services group, said yesterday that it expected
to report an operating loss of between Pounds 3.5m and Pounds 3.8m for the
half year to September, compared with a deficit of Pounds 2.3m last time.
The shares, 45p at the time of the demerger, have been slipping steadily and
closed yesterday at 22 1/2 p, down 4 1/2 p.
The company said the likely losses reflected heavy spending on development
and marketing and the continuing price war in the personal computer
industry.
Mr Derek MacLaren, chairman, said the announcement was not a profits
warning. When the company was floated, it had agreed to provide its
shareholders with progress reports at regular intervals, as well as half
yearly figures.
He and fellow directors were yesterday giving investors and analysts a
series of presentations on the state of the company and its future.
VideoLogic estimated sales for the first half at about Pounds 5.5m, some 20
per cent ahead of last year. Price cutting by personal computer
manufacturers was affecting margins and reducing profitability.
The company said its cost base was under continuous review, with an emphasis
on cutting product costs and improving operational efficiency. It expected
that the cost of research and market development as a percentage of sales
would reduce during 1995.
VideoLogic designs silicon chips and circuit boards which confer multimedia
capabilities on conventional personal computers. Sales growth has been due
primarily to a mass market product - 928Movie - which improves operating
system performance, as well as adding multimedia.
The company is still in the development phase, however, with a high
requirement for cash for research and development and marketing. The
demerger from Avesco was a consequence of this requirement.
