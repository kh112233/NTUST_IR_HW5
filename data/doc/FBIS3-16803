  [Excerpts] President Lennart Meri highly rated his visits 
to Israel and Ukraine; they were also productive. [passage 
omitted] Foreign Minister Juri Luik provided a survey of the 
agreements concluded. 
  [Begin Luik recording] With Israel we signed an agreement on 
the protection of investments. Now that there is quite 
substantial economic interest in Estonia on the part of Israeli 
businessmen this will definitely liven any business dealings and 
provide some kind of security and guarantees. 
  With Ukraine we signed agreements on developing scientific 
and cultural links and on visa-free travel for the holders of 
diplomatic passports. (?Travel on diplomatic passports does 
not, of course, amount to much) but it displays the first signs 
of goodwill, all the same. Serious agreements are probably to 
follow after a while. The most serious agreement will evidently 
be the one on free trade between the two countries. Estonian 
businessmen find it impossible to transport many goods, with the 
customs duty at 30 percent, which is definitely too much, so 
talks were held in this respect. We also have Peeter Tohver, 
the Economics Ministry's deputy chancellor with us. Evidently, 
an agreement on transit transport will also be completed in the 
near future. It will enable Ukraine to use Estonian ports as 
well as us using the services of Black Sea ports, should the 
need arise. So, I believe that trade and business relations 
between the two countries received quite a substantial boost 
[words indistinct]. [end recording]
