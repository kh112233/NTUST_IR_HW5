FT  04 JUL 94 / International Company News: Biogen says drug will reduce
disability in MS sufferers
Biogen, the US biotechnology company, expects to announce clinical trial
results within the next four to five weeks which should demonstrate one of
its drugs can reduce disability in multiple sclerosis patients.
It would be the first time a drug has been shown capable of reducing
disability caused by MS, a degenerative disease, which affects about 300,000
people in the US and as many as 400,000 in Europe.
The two-year clinical trial involving 300 patients is designed to show the
safety and effectiveness of Biogen's beta-interferon treatment. Mr Jim
Vincent, chairman, said the trial was designed to show the medicine
measurably reduces disability in MS patients.
At present, the only licensed product for multiple sclerosis is Betaseron,
Schering's treatment. This can slow nerve degeneration and cut the frequency
of attacks, but has not been demonstrated to reduce disability.
The drug, which was launched last year, has had to be rationed because of
huge demand. The product is expected to generate sales of DM560m (Dollars
351m) next year, according to US brokers Morgan Stanley.
If Biogen's beta-interferon receives a licence, the company plans to market
the drug on its own in the US and Europe, where the group believes it can
cover the market with no more than 200 sales representatives.
In Japan, Biogen plans to license the drug to another company. Mr Vincent
said the group was talking to several companies, both Japanese and
multinationals in Japan, and a decision would be taken soon.
Mr Vincent said he did not expect Biogen would need to return to the capital
markets during the launch of beta-interferon and Hirulog, a product that
blocks clotting of the blood. However, he warned the group's profitability
could be affected by the cost of finishing the trials and launching the two
drugs simultaneously in Europe and the US.
