  [Text] Wiesbaden -- The president of the Federal Criminal 
Office [BKA] Hans-Ludwig Zachert has issued a warning against 
the kind of drugs policy "that increases the number of addicts 
and at the same time turns the law-enforcement bodies into a 
kind of letter-scale police force [Briefwaagenpolizei]." 
  Speaking to DIE WELT, Zachert expressed himself publicly for 
the first time about the likely impact on the police of the 
Constitutional Court's ruling on hashish and on the subsequent 
North Rhine-Westphalian decree. The judges in Karlsruhe had 
decided that the possession of "small quantities" of hashish and 
marijuana would not be punishable in future. Later, North 
Rhine-Westphalian Justice Minister Rolf Krumsiek issued a decree 
also permitting smaller quantities of hard drugs like heroin, 
cocaine, and LSD, limiting the amount of heroin and cocaine that 
can be possessed to 0.5 grams. 
  According to Zachert, the German police will be placed in a 
ridiculous situation in the combatting of crime. "The police 
will be expected to obtain from organized drug dealers 
assurances that a confiscated supply of hard drugs was merely a 
small quantity, intended for occasional use," says Zachert. 
"Police investigators will find it extremely difficult to 
differentiate between a dealer and a consumer. The 
international drug business will adapt to the new situation and 
organize its drug supply is accordance with Germany's new 
regulations on drugs." The next objective of the drug dealers 
will be to establish further consumer markets for hard drugs. 
"And that will increase the number of hard drug addicts," says 
Zachert. 
  Zachert regrets the fact that the new policy on drugs, and 
the resultant trends, will make the state's preventive efforts 
more difficult. "It is difficult enough to explain to young 
people that they should avoid so-called soft drugs. But if the 
consumption of small quantities of soft drugs remains 
unpunishable, it is just a matter of time before they move on to 
increasing quantities of hard drugs," says Zachert. 
  This will have a negative effect on the fortunes of 
thousands 
of addicts, according to Zachert. "Apart from that, wherever 
soft drugs can be obtained, hard drugs are not far away," says 
Zachert. 
  Zachert claims that Eastern European drug rings are playing 
an increasing role in supplying the German market. For 
instance, the heroin in Germany no longer comes from just 
Pakistan, Afghanistan, or Iran, but also from central Asian 
countries like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Other 
than that, poppies have been grown in Ukraine for centuries, so 
the illegal drug market is also fed from there. 
  Poland almost plays a leading role in the supply of 
amphetamines to Western Europe. "But major centers of cocaine 
trade are also establishing themselves in Eastern Europe," says 
Zachert. "Investigations have revealed that the Colombian Cali 
cartel also has bases in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The 
quantities of drugs seized in Moscow indicate that more and more 
criminal elements from Western countries are taking advantage of 
the instability in the former Soviet Union for their own 
purposes."
