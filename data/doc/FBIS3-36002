  [Text] According to the Defense Ministry's press service, 
603 tanks, 630 armored cars, and 175 combat aircraft were 
scrapped in Ukraine by 17 November, 1993, in keeping with 
Ukraine's commitments under the treaty on conventional forces 
reductions in Europe. During 1993 over 50 international 
inspection teams visited Ukraine. They visited tank 
manufacturing and repair factories in Lvov, Nikolayev, Kiev, and 
Zhitomir, which are expected to shortly scrap a total of 100 
tanks and 60 armored cars. The newest stage in Ukraine's 
conventional weaponry reductions provides for scrapping over 600 
tanks and more than 300 armored cars.
