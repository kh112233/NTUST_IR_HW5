WORLD; 
MURDER-SUICIDE AT CONSULATE 
A Turkish guard at the Turkish Consulate killed an Italian co-worker in a fit 
of rage and turned his gun on himself in a murder-suicide spree today at the 
diplomatic mission. 
Police identified the victims as Ahmet Gulduoglu, 37, a Turkish policeman 
assigned to guard duty at the consulate, and Italian Vicenzio Di Scala, 
employed for the past 10 years at the mission. 
According to investigators, the morning shootings began after consular driver 
Kaliskan Adiguezel, 39, arrived at work and showed a newspaper article to Di 
Scala and Gulduoglu, who had just completed a security inspection of the 
garage. 
Police said the Turk went into an unexplained rage.
