SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order No. 905 [7 CFR part 905] regulating the handling
of oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tangelos grown in Florida, hereinafter referred to as the order. This order
is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C 601674], hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 



This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act which provides that whenever specified commodities, including
grapefruit, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of these commodities into the United States are
prohibited unless they meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements as those in effect
for the domestically produced commodities. Section 8e also provides that whenever two or more marketing orders regulate
the same commodity produced in different areas of the United States, the Secretary shall determine which area the
imported commodity is in most direct competition with and apply regulations based on that area to the imported commodity.
The Secretary has determined that grapefruit imported into the United States are in most direct competition with
grapefruit grown in Florida regulated under Marketing Order No. 905, and has found that the minimum grade and size
requirements for imported grapefruit should be the same as those established for grapefruit under Marketing Order
No. 905. 

The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they
present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.
