  [Text] The total production of the fuel and energy 
resources in 1990-1992 declined primarily due to a decrease in 
the coal and oil production. The lack of technical readiness to 
extract oil from the ground using more complicated practices 
precludes attempts at stabilizing or even increasing somewhat 
the oil production in the next 30-40 years. Coal production will 
increase yet it will be utilized primarily near the mining 
locations--in Russia's eastern regions--due to the difficulty of 
delivering it to the western regions. An increase in the gas 
production should be treated as an important yet 
difficult-to-meet goal. The planned nuclear power development 
scale would hardly make it possible to complete Russia's fuel 
balance. 
  Such a situation necessitates a search for new energy 
sources. In recent decades, scientists in Russia and abroad 
focused attention on the possibility of utilizing the heat 
released during the splitting of the so-called 
high-molecular silicates 
M[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]_x_SiO[.sub]2[/] type, where M=Na 
or K and _x_=3 or 4, e.g., the 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/] silicate. In this 
case, anhydrous silicon compounds of the SiR type, where R=C or 
N may serve as the splitting substance, e.g., a mixture of 
silicon carbide and nitride SiC + Si[.sup]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]. 
  The fission process may occur in two ways: the first is the 
conventional chemical reaction which is characterized 
by the interaction of material particles; the 
second--physical-chemical chain reaction--which is 
determined by the level of the material-energy reaction chains. 
A chain reaction may develop only in the case where the energy 
released during the occurrence of the preceding reaction is 
sufficient to start the next one. Academician A.N. Semenov 
characterized these type of reactions as the development of a 
chain process by means of energy chains. 
  The fission process occurs until the development of the 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]SiO[.sub]2[/] low-modulus 
silicate and CO and SiO carbon and silicon monoxide. According 
to the general theory of chain reactions, the presence of active 
silicate complexes and energy chains alone is insufficient to 
ensure a chain process. The crucial feature is the presence of 
the so-called critical mass of the silicate. Not all 
silicates can break up by the chain mechanism. In a number of 
silicates, the necessary initial energy in the initial state is 
consolidated only partially, so it must be additionally 
consolidated artificially from the initial substances. For 
example, in producing the 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/] silicate from the 
original products, i.e., sodium carbonate and sand: 
  (1)Na[.sup]2[/]CO[.sub]3[/] + 3SiO[.sub]2[/] = 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/] + 
CO[.sup]2[/]. 
  This process is widely known and is utilized in the 
glass-making industry. 
  The quantity of energy released during fission is calculated 
from the following formula [1, 2] 
  (2)Q = 
k[.sup]i[/][.sup].[/]10[.sup]3n[/], 
  where k is the indicator of the fuel type and 
purity and n is the coefficient of the chain reaction 
order; for the hydration process, n = 0, for a 
chemical reaction, n = 1, for a physical-chemical 
reaction, n = 2, for a nuclear reaction, n 
= 3, and for a fusion reaction, n = 4. 
  Analyses show that in the course of a purely chemical 
decomposition reaction, 1 kg of silicate releases 3,350 cal of 
heat [2], which is the same as Ekibastuz coal, while in a chain 
physical-chemical reaction, it releases 8.5 million kcal, i.e., 
in this case, it may replace 1,000 t of fuel oil. 
  Physical-chemical silicate chain reactions amount to a phase 
transformation during the process. At first, the high-modulus 
silicate is in the solid phase. To trigger its decomposition 
process, it is necessary to supply a relatively small quantity 
of initial energy from outside. As a result, it will be 
partially converted to the liquid phase, and the chain reaction 
will begin to develop. 
  Given a total transition of the critical silicate mass to 
the 
liquid state, reaction byproducts and energy are released 
abruptly (at a rate of an explosion). One can retard the energy 
release only by adding to the molten silicate mass special rods 
from anhydrous silicate compounds and withdrawing them. 
Insertion of the rods increases the energy chain multiplication 
factor, while their withdrawal decreases it. 
  The energy released in the devices as a result of the 
high-modulus silicate splitting under the effect of anhydrous 
silicon compounds may be broadly utilized virtually in all 
branches of the national economy with the help of a conventional 
heat exchange circuit using well-known designs. The gain from 
the transition to silicate fuel is indisputable. For example, we 
know that 39 t of liquid fuel are pumped into the tanks of the 
TU-154 airplane, yet the same energy can be derived from 39 kg 
of silicate. 
  Silicate fuel is inexpensive, and approximately 1.5 million 
t 
of it is produced annually in Russia. In the power industry, 
silicate power plants could be installed in place of boiler 
plants at thermal electric power plants and large boiler rooms. 
This is a new environmentally clean type of fuel, which is 
especially desirable for heat and power generating plants with a 
combined heat and electricity production as well as large urban 
boiler rooms located in residential construction and suburban 
areas. 
  The high-modulus silicate decay products, i.e., CO and SiO, 
are not discharged into the atmosphere but are forwarded to a 
special recovery module. In this module, carbon monoxide is 
converted to carbon dioxide, while silicon monoxide--into 
silicon dioxide. These substances are used for silicate recovery: 
  (3)Na[.sup]2[/])[.sup].[/]SiO[.sub]2[/] + 
2SiO[.sup]2[/] = 
Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]3SiO[.sub]2[/]. 
  The thermal pollution of the atmosphere is also greatly 
decreased, i.e., 
  Na[.sup]2[/]O[.sup].[/]SiO[.sub]2[/] + 
2SiO[.sup]2[/] = Na [sic]

  A schematic diagram of a power plant with a gaseous energy 
source is shown in the figure. In contrast to boiler furnaces, 
heat transfer in the water wall tubes is realized due to heat 
transfer from the more-heated medium to the less-heated medium 
through the pipe walls rather than due to radiative transport 
from the fuel combustion flare. 
  Silicate power engineering is still in its infancy. Today, 
the State Association of the National Scientific Research and 
Design Institute of Power Industry together with the Energy 
Physics Institute (Obninsk) and the Gidropress Special Hydraulic 
Press Design Office (Podolsk) are developing the design of a 
pilot silicate power plant with a 25 MW power with 6 MPa and 
275C heat transfer agent parameters. Shop drawings of the 
pilot-commercial power plant using the new energy source have 
been prepared and its assembly is in the finishing stages.
