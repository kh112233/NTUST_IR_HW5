FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Showa Denko in red after damages
charge
SHOWA DENKO, the Japanese chemicals producer being forced to settle damages
claims in the US as a result of blood disorders caused by a dietary
supplement it marketed there, took an extraordinary charge of Y46.18bn
(Dollars 442m) in the half-year to June to cover the suits.
Although it was able to offset more than half of this by selling land and
other assets, the interim net loss was still Y17.24bn, compared with
earnings last time of Y1.09bn.
The food additive, L-tryptophan, was withdrawn in 1989. More than 1,500
Americans were affected, of whom some 30 died.
