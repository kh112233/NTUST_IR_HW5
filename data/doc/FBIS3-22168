  [Text] The Pattani River has been found to be highly 
contaminated by such toxic heavy metals as cadmium and arsenic, 
which come from mining activities in Yala Province. 
  Research conducted by a team of lecturers at the Prince of 
Songkla University since 1992 has indicated that the amount of 
such dangerous substances is higher than the acceptable 
standards set by the World Health Organisation. This is 
especially so for arsenic which was recorded at 0.13 
milligrammes per litre against the standard of 0.05 mg/l. 
  The amount of cadmium in the river was measured at 0.04 
milligrammes per litre against 0.01 mg/l while lead 
contaminatlon was found at 0.02 mg/l. 
  The contamination is believed to be caused by mining 
activities at the Thalu Cave area in Yala's Bannang Sata 
District as miners dumped a huge amount of contaminated earth 
and sand into natural waterways. 
  Prof. Dr. Prawet Wasi, president of the National 
Sub-committee on Epidemiology, provided more funds to the team 
of researchers, led by Prince of Songkla Engineering Rector 
Suraphon Arikun. 
  Arsenic from tin-mining has long been the cause of a disease 
in Ron Phibun District in Nakhon Si Thammarat.
