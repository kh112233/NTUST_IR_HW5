SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Participants in the fraud and tax-evasion trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter began a 
three-week vacation Friday. 
The U.S. District Court case, in which Hunter is accused of 234 counts related 
to the giant J. David &amp; Co. Ponzi scheme, began April 18 after a three-week 
jury-selection process. 
Prosecutors have so far presented more than 100 witnesses. Two jurors and two 
alternate jurors have been released because of family illnesses, work 
conflicts, and, in one case, for knowing a witness. 
When the trial resumes Sept. 6, federal prosecutors are expected to spend two 
weeks before resting their case. Hunter's attorneys recently said they expect 
to take about three weeks presenting their theory that Hunter was blinded by 
love for convicted swindler J. David (Jerry) Dominelli and was unaware of any 
fraud.
