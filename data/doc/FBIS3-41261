  [Text] Piranshahr, W. Azarbaijan Prov., Feb. 8, IRNA -- 
There is some evidence that a large part of Dahuk Province in 
north of Iraq is under poppy cultivation. Publication of a map 
which has unveiled the activities of narcotics dealing bands in 
northern Iraq in the past three years, has caused a great 
concern among political and religious Kurdish circles whether 
the northern Iraq would be turned into a drug dealing center. 
  A 35-year old member of a Kurdish political group in 
northern 
Iraq who preferred not to be named, said that cultivation fields 
are in the areas under the control of `Guli' and `Birwari' 
tribes in Zakho. Some Iraqi military officials who have spent a 
hard life in the mountains in northern Iraq have taken advantage 
of the situation and are cooperating with the bands. 
  In view of the observers who are following developments in 
the region, if current trend is continued, northern Iraq will be 
turned into a big centre for production and distribution of 
narcotics of the `golden triangle' type.
