FT  27 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Boots Plunges
Shock news that Boots' heart drug could kill sent the company's shares
plunging. The fall reversed gains made earlier in the day which had been
prompted by unfortunately timed recommendations.
Several brokers were advising clients to buy stock first thing yesterday.
They have been arguing that worries over the Do-It-All chain have been
overdone and the share rating is undeservedly low.
Then, in the afternoon, Boots issued a statement on Manoplax which contained
the chilling sentence: 'Preliminary results have shown that patients
receiving the 100mg a day dose of the drug have a significantly increased
risk of death compared to those not receiving the drug.'
The shares plummeted from a high of 497p to close 29 down on the day at 464p
after unusually high turnover of 6.6m.
Analysts were generally unprepared to speak out publicly after the news but
many said the whole future of the drug was now in question. One said: 'This
is the second piece of surprise news on Manoplax. Last time it was indicated
that the placebos were more effective than the drug.' Another spoke of
'complete incompetence on the part of the management'.
Analysts had pencilled in earnings projections of around Pounds 250m for the
treatment in 1996. However, if the drug is pulled it will boost short-term
profits, which are being dragged down by spending of up to Pounds 45m in
marketing and research and development.
