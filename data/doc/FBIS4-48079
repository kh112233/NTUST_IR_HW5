  [Text] Foreign aid does not have a good reputation in the 
United States. There is an understandable perception that it's 
wrong to dispense charity abroad when so much is needed at home. 
There is also a feeling that much foreign aid simply drains 
into the bottomless pit of incompetent, spendthrift Third World 
countries. 
  As a result, legislation is being overhauled this year to 
make foreign aid more flexible and allow its use as an incentive 
for countries which pursue the right political and economic 
policies. The $600 million development, trade and investment 
package which President Clinton has offered South Africa over 
the next three years should be seen in this light. 
  Most of the money is intended for the private sector rather 
than government. Much is indirect aid or seed money aimed at 
"leveraging" greater amounts of private sector investment, both 
domestic and American. So, typically, the aid will consist of 
guarantees to building societies and other institutions to grant 
housing loans to black homeowners, or credit to black 
businessmen or guarantees to U.S. businesses to cover 
investments here. 
  The idea is to help jump-start the economy to the growth 
level needed to deliver the material needs of the back 
population. Not included in the $600 million total is the 
lifting of duties on 4,400 categories of South African products 
imported into the U.S. And the package is also designed to 
promote American business by opening up trade and investment in 
what America has identified as one of the world's top 10 
emerging markets. 
  South Africa should be reassured by this pragmatic approach. 
Ultimately it is only a flourishing private sector which will 
meet development needs.
