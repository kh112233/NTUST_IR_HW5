    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 19 
April. 
  The Guatemalan Government acknowledged today the difficulty 
in meeting its commitment with the IMF to increase taxes from 8 
to 10 percent, in relation to the gross domestic product (GDP). 
The finance minister admitted that in the first quarter tax 
revenues reached only 7.3 percent in relation to the GDP due to 
tax evasion. In addition, the finance minister reported the 
president had outlined a draft bill on tax reform, which could 
be approved shortly. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0036 GMT 14

  Tourism, the second largest grosser of foreign exchange, 
following coffee, will not reap $100 million this year due to 
the wave of violence unleashed in the country. Sources in the 
tourism sector have reported more than 45 percent of the trips 
by U.S. and European tourists have been canceled. The same 
source has said Guatemala cannot compete with Mexico and Costa 
Rica if they buttress their promotions with political stability 
while the state here persists in a permanent dispute and while 
there is no end to the war. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1939

  Guatemalan inflation reached 3.7 percent in the first 
quarter 
of 1994 after a rise in the consumer price index in January of 
2.14- percent, .95 percent in February, and .58 percent in 
March. The National Institute of Statistics has reported an 
increase in food and beverages prices of 3.53 percent; housing 
costs, 3.15 percent, health services, 3.9 percent; and home 
furnishings, 3.24 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0001
