  [Text] Cairo, March 25 (AFP) -- An outlawed Islamic 
militant group warned Friday it would avenge the deaths of eight 
of its members who it said were ``liquidated'' by police. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) said in a 
statement sent to AFP that the eight were killed after five 
policemen were shot dead last Sunday by al-Jama'ah militants in 
Sedfa, in the troubled southern province of Asyut. 
  The group said two militants were killed by police in 
fields, 
three died in a shootout in Balayza village in Asyut province, 
and three others were arrested at home in the same region then 
shot by police, who dumped their bodies next to the Balayza 
victims, saying all six died in the same gunbattle. 
  The al-Jama'ah said police had adopted a new tactic of 
releasing detained militants and ``liquidating'' them allegedly 
for taking part in attacks. 
  It called on human rights organisations to put pressure on 
the authorities ``to stop such practices.'' 
  Islamic militants have targeted the security forces, 
foreigners and Coptic Christians in their two-year campaign to 
destabilise the country and topple the secular government of 
President Husni Mubarak. 
  More than 300 people have died in the unrest.
