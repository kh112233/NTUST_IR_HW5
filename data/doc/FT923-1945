FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (14): A continent drifts
into crisis - Natural and man-made disasters, disease and debt are racking
Africa / Poverty and Hunger
'THE challenge facing Africa is exceptional . . . the cost of failure would
be appalling,' warned the World Bank nearly three years ago.
The challenge - to reverse the economic decline of the region - turned out
to be overwhelming, and the cost of failure is proving catastrophic. Without
a combination of further debt relief, additional resources assisted by
better management, and an upturn in the world economy, recovery in the
foreseeable future is out of reach.
Today sub-Saharan Africa, home to more than 500m people, is racked by
natural and man-made disasters, disease and the burden of foreign debt
exceeding Dollars 175bn. From Somalia to Zaire, from Mozambique to Sudan,
economies and social structures are collapsing, symptoms of the continent's
seemingly irreversible decline.
In its seminal analysis of the continent's plight - Sub-Saharan Africa: From
Crisis to Sustainable Growth - the bank said that 'overall, Africans are
almost as poor today (1989) as they were 30 years ago'.
To register 'a modest improvement in living standards', the report
calculated, 'sub-Saharan economies must grow by at least 4 to 5 per cent
annually'. Highly ambitious, given the region's past performance, the
report's authors acknowledged, 'but we believe it can be achieved'.
Nothing like that target has been reached, and nor does the bank's own
forecast of growth in the 1990s suggest that it will be attained in the
years to come.
Aggregate GDP for sub-Saharan Africa rose by 1.3 per cent in 1990, and
around 2.4 per cent in 1991: 'Not sufficient, in the context of Africa's
high population growth rate (3.2 per cent),' observes the bank's 1992 annual
report, 'to prevent per capita income from falling 0.6 per cent.'
Earlier this year the bank was expecting growth of 3.4 per cent in 1992  -
now being revised downward as the full affects of drought and a weak
international economy are taken into account - and projected an average
annual growth for the period 1990-2000 of 3.5 per cent.
'By 2,000, per capita gain in real income will be minimal for the region as
a whole', warned the bank in its report, Global Economic Prospects and the
Developing Countries, 'and may be negative in some countries.'
'Although relief can be expected from real increases in commodity prices and
debt and debt service reduction measures,' the report continued, sub-Saharan
Africa's limited stock of capital in equipment, infrastructure, and human
resources precludes any sharp improvements in living standards.'
Behind this detached analysis lies a tragedy of a dimension only partly
revealed by some of the grim statistics carried in the bank's annual report.
It calculates the number of poor at 228m - more than half sub-Saharan
Africa's population. Per capita income of Dollars 340 in 1990 is 'exceeded
by all the world's regions except South Asia'.
For many of the poor, their hold on life is tenuous. War and drought have
left 21m people at risk of starvation in the Horn of Africa. In southern
Africa, enduring its worst drought this century, some 19m people need food
aid.
But what the statistics conceal is the extent to which the infrastructures
and institutions have been disintegrating, leaving a generation of Africans
without the resources to implement blueprints for recovery. With few
exceptions, civil services are inefficient, schools and universities
ill-equipped, and management weak.
Whether the existing levels of aid can be sustained in the 1990s is open to
doubt. Africa's worries that concessional assistance might be diverted to
eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union, are valid,
acknowledges the bank: 'Unless donors' aid budgets are increased,' it warns,
'other developing countries may be affected.'
No significant help is likely in the form of external investment. One of the
most telling yardsticks of the loss of confidence in sub-Saharan Africa is
the flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Official figures show that
non-oil exporting countries in sub-Saharan Africa received on average less
than Dollars 0.5bn a year during the second half of the 1980s - 'roughly
what Papua New Guinea alone attracted during the same period', a UN report
wryly notes, and concludes: 'The low levels of FDI flowing to Africa
underline the increasing marginalisation of the region.'
Meanwhile, the spectre of Aids hangs over a continent already debilitated by
malaria, bilharzia, guinea worm and other parasitic diseases. Estimates of
the impact of Aids vary, but a conference last December in the Senegalese
capital Dakar was told that even at the most conservative official estimates
of the infection rate, at least 25 per cent of Africa's workforce could be
affected by 2010.
One in every 40 adults in Africa is already infected with the HIV virus that
causes Aids. These victims are part of Africa's economic engine - 15 to
49-year-old farmers, mine workers, even the educated elite.
Research presented at the conference on Aids in Africa found that the
labour-intensive agricultural and mining industries, the two pillars of the
economy of sub-Saharan Africa, are already suffering the impacts of Aids.
Some economists warn that the Aids pandemic poses a threat of unprecedented
economic disruption as the disease takes its toll. Some experts forecast
that Aids will kill 5m or more adults in the next eight years.
African officials argue that the world has a stake in helping their
countries stem a disease that could, they fear, cripple the key economic
sectors of the continent.
'Africa must not be abandoned,' says Dr Kekoura Kourouma, head of Guinea's
national Aids programme. 'Remember, a sick population will not be able to
work, will not be able to pay its debts.'
Whether such an appeal to self-interest in the west will have a greater
impact than humanitarian appeals remains to be seen. What seems certain is
that the worst of Africa's anguish may be yet to come.
