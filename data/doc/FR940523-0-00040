 

Regarding animal feed, food-producing animals consume primarily processed forms of cottonseed and rapeseed, in
which, as discussed above, the 

kan



r

 gene is not expected to remain intact. In addition, researchers have shown that nucleic acids introduced into the
rumens of calves, or incubated with calf, sheep, or cow rumen contents in vitro, were rapidly and completely degraded
to nucleotides and nucleosides (Ref. 29). 
c. 

Calculation of worst-case transformation frequencies. 


In its submission, Calgene addressed the potential for horizontal transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene. Natural transformation, i.e., the uptake and incorporation into the genome of free DNA, is known to occur in
some bacterial species. This is the only possible mechanism by which intestinal microflora could take up free DNA
(Ref. 30). However, none of the species known to be present in the GI tract has been found capable of acquiring exogenous
DNA by natural transformation. Nonetheless, to consider the worst-case scenario, Calgene assumed that all microbes
in the intestine would be able to take up and incorporate exogenous DNA at a frequency found for certain species of the
genus 

Streptococcus. 

Calgene noted that although the firm developed its transformation model for certain 

Streptococcus 

species, they are not aware of any information indicating that 

Streptococcus

 species found in the GI tract can be naturally transformed. 
To undergo natural transformation, the recipient bacterium must be transformation-competent, i.e., ready to take
up DNA. As noted, none of the bacterial species that occur in the GI tract is known to be capable of becoming transformation-competent.
In addition, the genome of a recipient bacterium should contain DNA homologous to the incoming DNA (Refs. 31 and 32).
Because the genomes of intestinal 

Streptococci 

or other intestinal bacteria are not expected to exhibit homology to the DNA constructs containing the 

kan



r

 gene

6

, Calgene assumed that the 

kan



r

 gene could only undergo ``illegitimate'' recombination, a process that does not require significant DNA homology.
Calgene noted that illegitimate recombination occurs in microorganisms at a much lower rate than homologous recombination.

One population that does contain DNA segments homologous with part of the 

kan



r

 construct is 

E. coli, 

because the 

kan



r

 construct contains part of an 

E. coli 

gene. Although 

E. coli 

constitutes one of the predominant species of aerobic GI tract bacteria, 

E. coli 

is not transformation-competent under conditions that prevail in the GI tract (Ref. 33). Thus, transformation of


E. coli 

due to homologous recombination is not an issue.

Under the foregoing worst-case assumptions, Calgene estimated that if a person consumes fresh tomatoes at the 90th
percentile level (i.e., eats more tomatoes than 89 percent of the individuals in the population), the transformation
frequency of the intestinal microorganisms with the 

kan



r

 gene will be approximately 3&times;10

^15 

transformants per day. This transformation frequency is more than 5 orders of magnitude less than the frequency of
mutation to kanamycin resistance per bacterial replication, i.e., 10

^9

 (Ref. 12). Thus, Calgene showed that for every 300,000 bacteria that mutate to kanamycin resistance per replication
(generally a matter of hours), there would be, at most, under worst-case conditions, one kanamycin-resistant bacterium
per day added to that number due to transformation. 
Calgene stated that the potential for food-producing animals to experience decreased efficacy of antibiotic therapy
as a result of pathogenic intestinal microflora incorporating and expressing the 

kan



r

 gene would be similar to that described for humans, i.e., equally improbable. In reaching this conclusion, Calgene
relied on the finding that DNA is rapidly and completely digested in the gut of food animals (Ref. 29) and on the contention
that the worst-case transformation scenario described above for human gut microorganisms also applies to microorganisms
found in the gut of food-producing animals. 
With respect to epithelial cells lining the intestinal lumen, Calgene provided information that no transformation
of human epithelial cells has been demonstrated in vivo (Ref. 2). In addition, even if transformed, intestinal epithelial
cells are terminally differentiated (i.e., do not divide) and have a relatively short life span (Ref. 34), and thus
would continually be shed and replaced by nontransformed cells. 


2. Potential Transfer of the 

kan



r

 Gene to Soil Microorganisms 


Calgene also considered the possibility that the 

kan



r

 gene might be transferred to soil microorganisms, thereby increasing the level of antibiotic-resistant organisms
in the environment. Calgene pointed out that the only plausible mechanism by which gene transfer could occur between
plants and bacteria is through natural transformation. Taking this mechanism into consideration and using worst-case
assumptions similar to those discussed above for intestinal microorganisms, Calgene calculated that, at worst,
kanamycin-resistant transformants resulting from plant DNA left in the fields would represent not more than one
in 10 million of the existing kanamycin-resistant soil population.
