SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Police have released a Clairemont man who had been held in connection with his 
wife's shooting. 
William Joseph Hine, 34, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder Tuesday 
after an incident in which his wife, Sabrina, 26, was shot in the head with a 
.357 magnum, a police spokesman said. 
Police released William Hine on Wednesday after his wife, who had been 
unconscious since the shooting, revived and told investigators that her husband 
was trying to prevent her from committing suicide when the gun went off, said 
Police Detective Rick Shaw. 
The district attorney's office will still review the case, but William Hine 
will "definitely" not be charged with attempted murder, Shaw said.
