FT  13 OCT 92 / Russians board Greenpeace ship
Russian coastguards yesterday fired three shots across the bow of a
Greenpeace ship investigating nuclear contamination and boarded the vessel,
Reuter reports from Moscow.
The Solo, with an international crew of 34, was boarded off the northern
islands of Novaya Zemlya. It is on a mission to monitor radiation at a place
where Soviet authorities dumped 15 nuclear reactors and 17,000 containers of
nuclear waste.
French naval police detained a Greenpeace ship and arrested four of its crew
in the port of Cherbourg yesterday as they protested over a planned shipment
of plutonium to Japan.
