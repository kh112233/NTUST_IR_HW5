SOLVENT TAKEN OFF DERAILED TRAIN; EVACUEES RETURN 
Hundreds of people evacuated near a derailed train were allowed to return home 
Wednesday after explosive naphtha solvent was unloaded from an overturned 
leaking tank car, authorities said. Nine cars of a 99-car Southern Pacific 
freight train jumped the tracks in the railroad yards on the southeastern edge 
of the city Tuesday.
