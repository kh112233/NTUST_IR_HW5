BERLIN WALL BITS USED AS RADIO GIMMICKS 
Two Twin Cities radio stations say they have made deals to acquire small pieces 
of the Berlin Wall and will give them away to listeners. 
A third station called the idea "pretty tacky." 
KDWB-FM made the first offer Monday morning when announcer Steve Cochran 
invited listeners to win a piece of the wall by calling the station. The 25th 
caller wins. 
KJJO-FM expects to start its promotion Friday. It will give away its 40 small 
pieces by asking listeners to call when they hear songs with wall in the 
titles. 
Mike Boen, general manager at KTCZ, said he was noncommittal when a radio 
syndicate offered 40 pieces of the wall for $500. 
The promotion "trivializes the whole episode," he said. "It kind of hit us as 
pretty tacky."
