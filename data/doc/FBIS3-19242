  [Text] Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring said 
tonight it had been made very clear to the IRA that there was no 
possibility of its involvement in negotiations in present 
circumstances. 
  The IRA had been told that if it ended terrorism, the 
British 
and Irish governments would be "generous in their response," he 
added. 
  But he said there had to be "an absolute renunciation of the 
violence, an end to violence, and an acceptance that violence 
will not solve the problems that we have on this island." 
  After recent incidents -- "the endangering of life at 
Heathrow, the murders in Belfast, it is time the IRA came to 
their senses and put it to an end," said Mr Spring, who is also 
his country's Foreign Minister and joint chairman -- with Ulster 
Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew -- of the Anglo-Irish Northern 
Ireland Conference. 
  Mr Spring said the IRA's actions over the past few days 
appeared totally contradictory. "On the one hand, they are 
saying they are flexible, they want to look at the peace 
process. At the same time, they are insulting the intelligence 
of ordinary people by bombing Heathrow airport, threatening 
innocent people in their daily lives. That to me is a total 
contradiction. 
  ``They have to end the violence, they have to show 
willingness and an acceptance that the Downing Street 
declaration is the best prospect for establishing peace on this 
island,'' he said.
