EXXON SPILL KILLED AS MANY AS 270,000 BIRDS, REPORT SAYS 
The Exxon Valdez oil spill killed between 90,000 and 270,000 sea birds, making 
it the deadliest such accident in history, and it will take up to 70 years for 
wildlife to recover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported Friday. 
The new mortality estimates are based on the number of carcasses recovered from 
Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska, as well as the known population of 
animals in the once-pristine region polluted by 11 million gallons of crude oil 
that spewed from the supertanker Exxon Valdez when it ran aground March 24. 
"On a global scale, the northern Gulf of Alaska harbors enormous populations of 
marine birds, and so the magnitude of losses from the Exxon Valdez spill was 
predictable and, not surprisingly, exceeds any other record of oil mortality we 
can find," said Fish and Wildlife Service biologists John Piatt and Calvin 
Lensink in their report. 
"It will take years and decades for some populations to return to pre-spill 
numbers," the biologists said.
