METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SLIGHTLY INJURED IN CAR CHASE, CRASH 
A pursuit of a stolen car by sheriff's deputies in Lawndale ended in a geyser 
of water about 40 feet high when the car ran a red light at 75 m.p.h., crashed 
into a late model Lincoln, slightly injuring its driver, and then hit a fire 
hydrant. 
The driver of the stolen car -- a 1990 Chrysler taken from a Torrance 
dealership -- James Earl Mays, 22, of Torrance, suffered minor injuries as did 
the driver of the Lincoln, Marilyn Causman, 45, also of Torrance. 
Deputies had tried to stop the car for making an illegal U-turn, but Mays sped 
off, Sheriff's Sgt. Robin Sawyer said. Mays then allegedly tried to ram a 
sheriff's car in the ensuing pursuit but lost control and ran the light. 
Mays was booked for investigation of grand theft auto, assault with a deadly 
weapon (the car) on a peace officer and felony evading arrest.
