FT  09 NOV 94 / UN to set up Rwanda war tribunal
The Security Council voted yesterday to set up an international tribunal to
try those responsible for the genocide in Rwanda, AP reports from the United
Nations in New York.
The new Rwandan government voted against the measure. It objected because
the resolution rules out the death sentence for those found guilty of
organising and carrying out the ethnic and political slaughter in the
central African nation. However, UN officials said the Rwandan government
had indicated it would co-operate with the tribunal.
Rwanda was the only member of the 15 member Security Council to vote against
the resolution which will open the way for an international court similar to
the one set up to try war criminals from the former Yugoslavia. China
abstained.
More than 500,000 people are believed to have perished in violence that
swept over Rwanda after the country's president was killed in an air crash
last April.
