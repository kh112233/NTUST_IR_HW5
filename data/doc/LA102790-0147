CONGRESS PASSES BILL TO EXPAND FOOD LABELS 
Congress approved legislation Friday to give consumers more nutritional 
information about the foods they purchase, sending the bill to President Bush. 
The House approved the bill setting specific standards for nutrition labels and 
requiring them to be on packaged foods. 
The legislation, passed by the Senate on Wednesday, also mandates that bulk 
food in bins, raw fish and fruits and vegetables be displayed with a sign or 
brochure providing nutritional information. 
Food sold by restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals and grocers with annual sales 
of less than $500,000 is exempt. 
Labels would be required to display: 
 -- Serving size. 
 -- Number of servings per container. 
 -- Calories per serving and number of caloriers from fat. 
 -- Amount of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates, 
complex carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber, protein. 
The measure requires the Department of Health and Human Services to publish 
draft regulations 12 months after enactment, and final regulation six months 
later.
