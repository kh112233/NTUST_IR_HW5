1 DEAD, 3 INJURED IN HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT 
A 67-year-old North Hollywood woman was killed and three others injured in a 
hit-and-run car crash in which one car ran a red light Sunday afternoon at 
Victory Boulevard and Bellaire Avenue, police said. 
Sirour Mazmanyan was killed when she was ejected from the passenger side of a 
Nissan Sentra when it collided with an American Motors vehicle. 
Two other passengers in the car were hospitalized. A third received minor 
injuries and was treated at the scene, police said. None of the injured were 
wearing seat belts. 
Police were searching for the male driver of the American Motors car Sunday 
night. A witness wrote down the license plate number of the vehicle. 
It was unclear which vehicle ran the red light, Officer Joanna Needham said. 
The Nissan was traveling on Bellaire and turning left onto Victory about 1 p.m. 
when it was broadsided by the other vehicle, police said. 
The names of the injured were not released.
