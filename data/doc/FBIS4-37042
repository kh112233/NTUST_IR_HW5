  [Text] Tehran, June 15 (AFP) -- A visit by an Iranian 
delegation to Iraq, which was due to take place on June 11, has 
been indefinitely postponed, a reliable source said Wednesday. 
  The source did not say which side had postponed the visit or 
why it had been delayed, but added that it was not caused by 
political problems but by timetabling difficulties. 
  The delegation had been expected in Baghdad on Saturday to 
prepare a visit in July by 'Ali Akbar Velayati, who would be the 
first Iranian top official to visit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf war. 
  The sources said the delegation was to leave for Iraq "in 
the 
near future," but did not give a specific date. 
  The decision to postpone the visit appears to have been 
taken 
at the last minutes as Velayati confirmed his visit to Iraq last 
Friday and the daily Kayhan International said Sunday that the 
delegation had already left for Baghdad. 
  The last visit by an Iraqi delegation to Iran was also 
postponed from November to February, following a "decision by 
Baghdad." 
  Last October, Iran and Iraq resumed talks, broken after the 
Gulf war, to normalise ties, five years after the end of 
1980-1988 war. 
  However, little headway has been made as Tehran and Baghdad 
are sharply divided over a number of issues, mainly the fate of 
thousands of prisoners of war from both countries. 
  Velayati, who met his Iraqi counterpart Sa'id al-Sahhaf on 
the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement conference in Cairo 
earlier this month, has warned that "more time is needed to 
restore confidence." 
  President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani has for his part 
urged caution over any chances of success from Velayati's visit. 
  "There are too many subjects to be discussed," he said last 
week. "If the results of negotiations are acceptable, they could 
open way towards improving ties."
