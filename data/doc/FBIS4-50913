Social Sciences Sociology Research Institute : "Which Provinces 
and Municipalities Are Developing Faster in the Wake of Reform 
and Opening Up?"] 
  [Text] In the 14 years since reform and opening up 
(1979-1992), China has registered rapid growth in its economic 
and social development. To make a comprehensive assessment of 
the overall achievements made since reform and opening up and 
draw a comparison between provinces and municipalities, the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Sociology Research Institute 
"Social Indicator" Topic Group selected 20 representative major 
indicators from the 1993 China Statistics Almanac and 
information provided by relevant departments, used composite 
index numbers to make vertical and horizontal comparisons, and 
assessed and arranged sequentially the social development growth 
of the provinces and municipalities. 
<H5>  I. Coastal Areas Register Swiftest Growth, With Zhejiang, </H5>
Guangdong, Hainan, Jiangsu, and Shanghai Taking the Lead 
  Regarding the composite growth indices for the 20 indicators 
in economic and social development since reform, Zhejiang ranked 
first, registering an increase in 1992 of 180 percent over 1978, 
an average annual growth of 7.6 percent; Guangdong ranked 
second, an annual rise of 7.5 percent; Hainan and Jiangsu, were 
both up 7.4 percent annually; and Shanghai was up 7 percent. 
The provinces ranking 6th to 10th were: Yunnan and Shandong, 
up 6.9 percent; and Fujian, Xinjiang, and Henan, up 6.3 percent. 
Those ranking 11th to 20th, with an annual progressive growth 
of 6.1 percent to 5.2 percent were: Hebei, Jiangxi, Guizhou, 
Guangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and Shanxi. 
Those ranking 21st to 30th, with an annual growth of 5.1 
percent to 4 percent were: Liaoning, Beijing, Ningxia, Tianjin, 
Jilin, Tibet, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, and Qinghai. 
  1. Hainan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Zhejiang have the 
fastest growth in the economic efficiency index. 
  The economic efficiency index, which comprises the six 
indicators of per capita GDP, social labor productivity 
(calculated according to comparable prices), original value of 
the state's industrial fixed assets, capital profit and tax rate 
of industrial enterprises, per capita local revenue, and grain 
produced by every agricultural laborer, is the key to social 
development and a better quality of life. It reflects the 
comprehensive increase in economic efficiency of industrial and 
agricultural production. As regards the national composite 
index, the average annual growth was 6.2 percent in the 14 
years. The quickest growth of 9 to 10 percent was registered in 
Hainan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Zhejiang. A relatively fast 
growth of 7.6 to 7.9 percent was recorded in Fujian, Guizhou, 
Jiangsu, Xinjiang, and Shandong. The per capita GDP is an 
essential composite indicator reflecting economic and social 
development. The growth in Zhejiang was the fastest in 14 
years, with an annual increase of 11.6 percent while Guangdong 
registered an 11.5 percent rise. A relatively fast growth of 8 
to 9.9 percent was recorded in Jiangsu, Fujian, Shandong, 
Xinjiang, Hainan, Henan, and Sichuan. The social labor 
productivity (average national income) is an important indicator 
reflecting overall economic efficiency. Zhejiang ranked first, 
with a 10.6 percent rise while Guangdong rose by 10.2 percent. 
The growth was between 8.2 to 9.6 percent in Jiangsu, Fujian, 
Xinjiang, and Shandong. The capital profit and tax rate of 
industrial enterprises is an important indicator reflecting 
industrial economic efficiency. Compared with 1978, the 
country's rate in 1992 had dropped 59 percent. With the 
exception of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet which registered 
increases, the rate in the other 27 regions dropped. 
  2. The index of social set-up increased fastest in 
Hainan, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, and Hunan. 
  The social set-up, which comprises the four indicators of 
the 
ratio of laborers in the tertiary industry, the ratio of 
nonagricultural laborers, the ratio of nonagricultural 
population, and the ratio of social investment, reflects the 
extent of urbanization and social development. The nation's 
average growth has increased 4.5 percent annually over the past 
14 years, with Hainan, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, and Hunan 
registering the highest rate of 8.2 down to 6.5 percent. In the 
ratio of laborers of the tertiary industry, the country's 
average rose from 12.1 percent in 1978 to 19.6 percent in 1992, 
a rise of 62 percent or an annual rise of 3.5 percent. A fast 
rate of 6.2 percent down to 5.1 percent was recorded in Hubei, 
Guangdong, Fujian, Tibet, Qinghai, Zhejiang, Shandong, and 
Anhui. Viewed from the proportion of the laborers in the 
tertiary industry, the highest rate of 45.6 percent down to 27.2 
percent was recorded in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and 
Guangdong. The proportion of nonagricultural population 
developed at a relatively slow pace, with the country's average 
rising from 15.8 percent in 1978 to 21.7 percent in 1992, a rise 
of 37.2 percent. Shandong achieved the quickest rate, rising 
from 8.8 to 20.5 percent, up 133 percent or an annual increase 
of 6.2 percent. A relatively quick annual rate of 4.1 down to 
3.2 percent was also registered in Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, and 
Guangdong. 
  3. The population quality index rose fastest in 
Shanghai, Shandong, and Xinjiang. 
  Comprised of the natural growth rate, the proportion of 
people with junior high school education in the total 
population, and the number of university and college graduates 
per 10,000 workers, the number of technicians per 10,000 
workers, and the number of doctors per 10,000 people, the index 
reflects the ability to control population growth and the 
quality of culture, technology, and health. As the improvement 
in population quality requires a relatively high input and 
training people takes a long time, its growth is slower than 
other systems. The national average rose at an annual rate of 
4.1 percent, with Shanghai, Shandong, and Xinjiang in the 
forefront, at 8.8, 5.7, and 5.4 percent respectively. The 
nation's natural growth rate decreased from 12 per mill in 1978 
to 11.6 per mill in 1992. Shanghai did a good job in population 
control and dropped its natural growth rate from 5.1 per mill in 
1978 to 0.5 per mill. Shandong ranked second, with its rate 
dropping from 10.5 to 4.6 per mill. The rate in Beijing dropped 
from 6.8 to 3.1 per mill. If calculated backwards with the 
negative index, the annual average increases for the province 
and two municipalities are 17.3, 6.2, and 5.7 percent 
respectively. As regards the number of technicians per 10,000 
workers, the nation's average increased from 612 in 1978 to 
1,616 in 1992, up 164 percent or an annual rise of 7.2 percent. 
The rate was relatively fast in Xinjiang, Fujian, Guangdong, 
Yunnan, and Zhejiang, registering annual increases of 9.2 down 
to 8.6 percent. However, the number of technicians per 10,000 
workers in Xinjiang and Guangdong is around 1,400, which is a 
relatively low level. The number of doctors per 10,000 people 
increased from 11.2 to 15.7 nationwide, an annual rise of 2.4 
percent. A relatively high growth of 3.9 to 3.4 percent was 
recorded in Henan, Zhejiang, Hainan, Xinjiang, Tianjin, and 
Jiangsu. 
  4. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Guangdong had the 
highest index in quality of life. 
  Quality of life reflects consumption, wages, incomes, and 
social welfare. Viewed nationwide, the rate in 1992 rose by 172 
percent over 1978, an annual increase of 7.4 percent. It is one 
of the systems with the quickest growth. Viewed from the 
regions, a fast growth of 9.9 percent was registered in Jiangsu, 
9.3 percent in Zhejiang, 8.8 percent in Shanghai, and 8.3 
percent in Guangdong. The consumption level of inhabitants rose 
at an annual rate of 6.8 percent (after deducting the factor of 
price increases, same hereafter). Hainan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, 
Shanghai, Tibet, and Hubei had the quickest growth of 8.4 to 7.5 
percent. The per capita net income of peasants rose at an 
annual rate of 7.6 percent, with Jiangsu, Tibet, Zhejiang, 
Shandong, Tianjin, and Fujian registering a high rate of 10.8 to 
8.8 percent. The workers' average wages increased 4 percent 
annually, with Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Tianjin 
achieving a high rate of 6.5 to 5.1 percent. 
<H5>  II. A Few Problems Which Merit Attention in Development </H5>
  1. The degree of coordination in economic and social 
development still needs improvement. Since reform and opening 
up, the uncoordinated economic and social development has been 
manifest in the following: 
  First, the improvement in the quality of life surpasses that 
in economic efficiency. Generally speaking, the improvement in 
the quality of life can be steady only when it is based on an 
increase in economic efficiency. Over the past 14 years, the 
nation's annual average growth was 7.4 percent, surpassing the 
6.2 percent of economic efficiency by 1.2 percentage point. 
Second, the improvement in population quality is slower than 
that in economic growth. The improvement in population quality 
is the motive force for economic growth. Because training 
people requires a relatively long time, growth is relatively 
slow. The average annual improvement in the nation's population 
quality was 2.1 percentage points lower than economic 
efficiency. If it is too low, it indicates that the two are not 
coordinated and that the increase in the number of technicians 
cannot meet the needs of economic growth. Third, the increase in 
revenue is lower than economic growth. Viewed nationwide, the 
growth in per capita revenue is slightly higher than that in per 
capita GDP. Nevertheless, the factor of price increases is not 
deducted in revenue. When it is done, the growth in the former 
will be slower than that of the latter. 
  2. Never slacken efforts to keep population strictly 
under control because population growth will directly hinder 
economic and social development. 
  The natural growth rate over the past 14 years experienced a 
process of drop, recovery, and drop again, reaching 11.6 per 
mill in 1992, a slight drop of 0.4 per mill from 1978. Viewed 
from the net increase of population over the past 14 years, the 
country had an increase of 209 million people, 21.7 percent or 
an annual rise of 1.4 percent or 14.94 million people. To 
further boost economic and social development, it is necessary 
to keep population strictly under control and lower the 
excessive growth rate. 
  3. Regional development is uneven and the gap between 
the east and west is further widening. 
  The coastal areas have developed rapidly since reform. Of 
the 13 areas with a high composite index in development over the 
past 14 years, 8 are coastal areas. Of the 14 areas ranking 
ahead in improving life quality, 9 are coastal areas. The areas 
with a rapid growth were basically the same as those which 
attained the advanced social development level in 1992. As the 
coastal areas took bigger strides in reform and opening up and 
maintained a high-growth competitive superiority, they could get 
the upper hand in both development level and growth. Because of 
their weak economic foundation prior to reform and their low 
base figure in 1978, Yunnan, Henan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Anhui, and 
other underdeveloped regions have developed rapidly since reform 
and opening up. Their growth rates propelled them into 
positions better than 16th place, with Yunnan ranking 6th. 
  However, the 1992 social development level of these regions 
still lagged behind 22d place. Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and 
Jilin, which had sharp contrasts in their development levels and 
growth, ranked 4th, 6th, and 8th, respectively in their 1992 
social development level but their growth in the past 14 years 
was 21st, 28th, and 25th, respectively. The development levels 
of Beijing and Tianjin were 1st and 3d but their growth ranked 
22d and 24th, respectively. The main reason is that these 
municipalities had a sound foundation. Since reform, however, 
there have been no major changes in the social set-up or an 
increase in economic efficiency. Therefore, their composite 
development indexes were relatively lower than other regions. 
It is noteworthy that the gap between the economically 
developed coastal regions and the underdeveloped remote areas is 
further widening.
