FT  18 FEB 93 / Familiar ground is scoured again: Alan Pike predicts what
Virginia Bottomley is likely to tell Michael Portillo when his search for
savings moves to the NHS
MR MICHAEL Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, will tread hallowed
ground when he takes the government's review of public expenditure into the
Department of Health.
It is less than five years since a small ministerial committee, including
Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister, and Mr John Major, her successor,
undertook a similar task as part of the review leading to the 1991 National
Health Service reforms.
They discovered that the NHS stands up to international comparison as a
broadly efficient means of delivering healthcare - one reason why Britain's
GDP expenditure on health is relatively low. But they also discovered that
healthcare costs rise faster than general inflation, and that public
expectations - fuelled by factors such as the growing number of elderly
people in the population - rise faster still.
Mr Portillo will make the same discoveries. Health has benefited from more
generous financial settlements than most Whitehall departments in recent
years. Yet his spending review will start its quest for savings when doctors
and other NHS staff are again saying the service is underfunded - and when
there is little appetite among ministers for radical reform. The unthinkable
about the NHS was examined five years ago during the Thatcher review, when
the main alternative way of funding health care - through individual
insurance - was examined.
The No Turning Back group of Conservative MPs - of which Mr Portillo is a
member - and free-market think tanks put forward ideas such as offering tax
concessions for taking out private insurance and opting out of NHS
provision.
The government decided to retain the taxation-based system, and given the
political problems encountered in introducing its health reforms there is no
enthusiasm among ministers - and little among backbenchers  - for reopening
these arguments.
Re-examination would, in any case, almost certainly lead to retention of the
status quo. Tax incentives were rejected because they would encourage
working-age people, who use the NHS least, to opt out. Their tax revenue
would be lost, while NHS costs would be little changed.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, will tell Mr Portillo she is
trying to attract more private-sector investment. Health authorities and
hospitals are being urged to seek joint ventures with the private sector in
providing expensive equipment and services such as waste incineration and
energy conservation.
The Independent Healthcare Association would like the government to go
further and involve the private sector in overall national health planning,
and increase opportunities for private hospitals to treat NHS patients. This
is starting to happen through the activities of GP fund-holders, but is
unlikely to offer great savings to the NHS.
Mrs Bottomley will tell Mr Portillo the NHS is becoming more efficient as a
result of the 1991 reforms. She will point to an increase in the number of
patients treated through cost-effective advances like day-case surgery. She
will cite her plans to reform London healthcare as a further example of her
determination to get maximum value from her Pounds 29bn budget. But these
developments will, at best, help reduce the NHS's appetite for extra funds
rather than provide opportunities for savings.
Attempts by politicians to curb health spending, either by raising
prescription and other charges or reducing activity, are almost as old as
the NHS itself. They invariably cause political agony.
Lord Lawson, the former chancellor recalls in his book The View from Number
11 that when in 1982 the Thatcher government was presented with a think tank
programme of cuts, including replacing parts of the NHS with compulsory
health insurance, it caused 'the nearest thing to a cabinet riot in the
history of the Thatcher administration.'
After a decade of accusations that its good faith towards the NHS was in
doubt, the government would find such decisions even more difficult now -
even if it did not have a manifesto commitment to annual increases in real
NHS resources.
Next month Mrs Bottomley will speak at a British Medical Association
conference on health rationing. This marks the beginning of a brave attempt
by politicians and doctors to tell the public that no healthcare system can
deliver every possible good thing. Priorities must be agreed.
Such an approach, which implies putting gradual limits on the scope of NHS
activities, offers the best long-term hope of containing health expenditure.
But it is a difficult and sensitive debate, and one that has hardly started
in Britain.
Mr Portillo will be looking for speedy savings, not philosophical shifts in
attitudes. The NHS has few to offer.
