  After his arrival, President Idriss Deby made a statement to 
JANA in which he said: I am extremely happy at being here today 
on the soil of the Great Jamahiriyah, the friendly country with 
which we share several common elements, including our history, 
blood, and culture. I am visiting the Great Jamahiriyah to 
discuss, strengthen and bolster our relations, and to look for 
further ways to promote fruitful and useful cooperation. 
  I would like, in the name of Chad, to thank the Libyan 
people 
and its leadership for the courage and understanding they have 
shown regarding the implementation of the International Court of 
Justice's resolution [on the Aouzou Strip], an element which 
could not be neglected. We believe that it is now time to open 
a new era of cooperation. My visit comes within this framework.
