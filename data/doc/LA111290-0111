Mazda Recalls Somes RX-7s: Mazda voluntarily recalled 2,708 RX-7s after it was 
told by air-bag maker TRW that there might be three defective bags among the 
sports cars made between Nov. 1, 1989, and July 2, 1990, a Mazda spokesman 
said. 
Owners are being notified by mail to take their cars to Mazda dealers for 
inspections. If necessary, air bags will be replaced at no cost. Mazda said it 
was not aware of any injuries.
