<F P=106> [Report of Maritime Kray Statistics Administration: "The </F>
Kray Is Actually Making the Move to Market Relations; the 
Socioeconomic Status of Maritime Kray in 1993"] 
  [Text] The results of 1993 indicate that the economy was 
not stabilized in Maritime Kray and that the economic reforms 
are running into difficulty. One thing is absolutely certain, 
however: The kray is actually making the move to market 
relations. 
  The number of enterprises is rising. By the end of the year 
there were already more than 31,000. More than 10,000 are 
private or individual enterprises, and 17,000 are joint-stock 
companies, partnerships, and public organizations. 
  The private and mixed forms of ownership extended to almost 
one-fourth of all large and medium-sized industrial enterprises. 
They produced 16 percent of the whole industrial product, 86 
percent of the product of light industry, and 21 percent of the 
product of the food industry. During the year the commodity 
turnover of private enterprises rose from 5 percent of the total 
to 16 percent, and their share of paid services for the 
population rose from 6 to 10 percent. These entities performed 
38 percent of all of the construction and installation work of 
contracted construction organizations. 
  Price controls are virtually nonexistent. Prices are now 
influenced mainly by supply and demand. 
  The consumer market, which had been in ruins by the end of 
1991, was revived and is operating dynamically. The supply of 
goods in the market has increased substantially, although some 
prices are extremely high. The prerequisites have been 
established for a stock exchange and a securities market. 
  These positive processes, however, occurred at a time of 
severe crisis in the production sphere. The decrease in 
production volume was characteristic of all branches of the 
economy. 
  The following are indicators of the kray's socioeconomic 
status:

<H5>  Finances </H5>
  Profits in the kray in 1993 were estimated at 600 billion 
rubles, with an average monthly rate of increase of 178 percent, 
exceeding the rate of increase in prices. Industry accounted for 
more than 40 percent of all profits. 
  The value of enterprise income, however, was reduced 
perceptibly by rising prices. Around 24 percent of all the 
enterprises in the kray were operating at a loss in 1993. Most 
of them were in branches of the non-production sphere: around 60 
percent of the enterprises in housing and public utilities and 
consumer services, 25 percent in editing and publishing, and 
over 50 percent in culture and art. 
  The financial status of enterprises compounded the 
nonpayment 
crisis. The new wave of reciprocal indebtedness slowed down the 
flow of commodities and created difficulties in the acquisition 
of the necessary crude resources and materials and in the sale 
of finished products. 
  The overdue payments of industrial and agricultural 
enterprises and construction and transport organizations on 
debts to suppliers had reached 92 billion rubles by 1 December 
1993. 
  The amount had quadrupled since the beginning of the year 
just in industry and construction. Meanwhile, overdue payments 
by customers and clients amounted to 106 billion rubles by 1 
December 1993, representing 43 percent of the total purchaser 
debt. 
  Enterprises covered much of the shortage of financial 
resources with bank credit. The total amount of indebtedness for 
bank credit was 128 billion rubles on 1 December 1993, including 
60 billion rubles, or 47 percent, owed by state enterprises. 
  The absence of strict control in mutual settlements between 
enterprises and the budget is affecting their financial 
stability. The rate of solvency is low in nonferrous metallurgy, 
machine building, metalworking, and agriculture. 
  The indebtedness of enterprises to their own workers also 
continued to grow. The total on 1 January 1994 was 15 billion 
rubles (excluding transfers to workers' bank accounts), 
displaying a 19-fold increase since the beginning of the year. 
This increasing indebtedness is connected mainly with the 
shortage of funds in current accounts. 
  By the end of 1994 the amount of back pay owed to the 
workers 
of industrial enterprises was equivalent to 94 percent of the 
whole amount designated for the payment of wages to these 
workers during the month. The figure was 82 percent in 
construction and 87 percent in agriculture. 
  According to Finance Administration data, the kray budget 
deficit at the end of the first 11 months of 1993 was 16.5 
billion rubles. The main elements making up the deficit were 
uncollected profit tax--45 percent, value-added tax--20 percent, 
and income tax from physical persons--20 percent. A much small 
portion of the budget consists of revenue from privatization--3 
percent, excise tax--2 percent, property tax--1 percent, and 
state duties--0.5 percent. 
  Budget expenditures in January-November totaled 390.9 
billion 
rubles, with no significant changes in expenditure patterns. 
This included 170.6 billion rubles for the kray economy, 
representing 44 percent of all expenditures, 157.2 billion 
rubles for sociocultural measures (40 percent), and 10.8 billion 
rubles for the maintenance of state governing and administrative 
bodies and law enforcement agencies (3 percent). 
  According to Central Bank data, credited investments in the 
kray economy (excluding Savings Bank credits) totaled 517.9 
billion rubles on 1 January 1994--a figure 5.9 times as high as 
the figure for 1 January 1993. 
  Most of the credit extended was used for current economic 
needs rather than investment. The proportional amount of 
long-term credit decreased from 2.8 percent of the total at the 
beginning of the year to 1.5 percent at the end. Commercial 
banks extended virtually no long-term credit to enterprises 
because of the insufficient funds in enterprise current accounts. 
  According to Tax Inspectorate data, taxes and other 
obligatory payments amounted to 701.9 billion rubles on 1 
January 1994, including 245.3 billion rubles in payments to the 
federal budget and 456.6 billion to the local budget. 
  In addition to this, there were deposits of 68.9 billion 
rubles in extra-budgetary funds, including 35.1 billion rubles 
in highway funds, 500 million in environmental funds, 10 billion 
in the employment fund, and 23.3 billion in the medical 
insurance fund. 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  By 1 January 1994, 921 enterprises in the kray had been 
privatized--641 of them in 1993. 
  Around 86 percent of the latter were sold to private owners 
and 14 percent underwent joint-stock conversion (complete or 
partial). 
  There were no significant changes in the sectorial structure 
of enterprises slated for privatization in the past year, but 
there were perceptible changes in their structure in terms of 
forms of ownership. The enterprises privatized in 1993 included 
federal property (7 percent) and territorial property (6 
percent), while the proportional amount of municipally owned 
plants and factories decreased slightly and amounted to 87 
percent. 
  "Small-scale" privatization generally took the form of sales 
with no governmental restrictions. Leased property with a 
buy-out option represented 16 percent of all privatized 
enterprises, 54 percent were privatized by means of commercial 
competitive bidding, and 15 percent were sold at auction. 
  The average transfer value of sold enterprises (the 
relationship between the sale price and the original price) in 
1993 was 46.6 percent: 61.6 percent for municipally owned 
enterprises, 3 percent for territorial property, and 2 percent 
for federal property. 
  The higher sale rate of municipally owned enterprises in the 
kray was due to their lower cost and consequent heightened 
accessibility to investors. These facilities usually do not 
require large investments after acquisition. 
  The privatization of large and medium-sized enterprises 
generally takes the form of stock issues. The second advantage 
option, allowing the labor collective to keep the controlling 
package of stock, is the preferred method. This option was 
chosen by 91 percent of the enterprises that became joint-stock 
companies. 
  Revenue from the privatization of enterprises (including 
funds received from enterprises privatized in 1992) amounted to 
over 21 billion rubles in currency and more than 202,000 
privatization checks. 
  The territorial budget received 68 percent of the currency, 
the federal budget received 21 percent, and other agencies 
received 11 percent. 
  During the year 129,700 apartments with a total area of 
6,135,200 square meters--47.3 square meters was the average 
apartment size (costing 86,000 rubles)--were privatized and 
became the personal property of citizens. 
  Since the beginning of the housing privatization process 
(1989), 173,000 apartments, or almost a third of all the 
apartments slated for privatization, have been sold to citizens 
or transferred to them without charge. 
<H5>  Liberalization of Prices </H5>
  The situation in the kray consumer market in 1993 
contributed 
to the escalation of inflationary processes. 
  The consumer price index, measuring inflation dynamics 
(excluding non-essentials), for all of 1993 was 1,161 percent of 
the December 1992 figure. 
  The rate of increase in the prices of goods and services 
declined during the year. The average monthly increase in 
consumer prices decreased from 28 percent in the first quarter 
to 19 percent in the fourth and reached its lowest level in 
December--14 percent. 
  Food prices were 10 times as high at the end of the year as 
at the beginning. The prices of meat, poultry, sausage, and fish 
products were more than 15 times as high, and the prices of 
eggs, flour, bread, and baked goods were 11-13 times as high. 
Food prices in urban markets were more than 10 times as high as 
in December 1992. The highest recorded increases were for dairy 
products--17 times--and farming products--9-13 times. 
  Vladivostok remained on the list of Russia's "expensive" 
cities all year. Most of the food prices here were 1.5-2 times 
as high as the Russian average. The prices of manufactured goods 
were 10 times as high at the end of the year as at the 
beginning, and the prices of cotton fabric, hosiery, leather 
footwear, and underwear were 12-16 times as high. There was an 
even more perceptible rise in the prices of office and school 
supplies, detergents, and building materials (16-25 times). 
  Medicine prices rose at a particularly dramatic rate--71 
times on the average and 150 or more times for some medications. 
  The rise in the cost of paid services was much higher than 
the rise in the cost of goods. Services cost almost 28 times as 
much at the end of the year as at the beginning--triple the rate 
of increase in the consumer prices for goods. Fees for notary 
services were more than 900 times as high as they were in 
December 1992, maritime transport rates were 95 times as high, 
motor transport fares were 31 times as high, and the services of 
public health and cultural establishments were 28-30 times as 
high. 
  The passage of Decree No 1001 of the Russian Federation 
Government of 2 October 1993 "On Immediate Measures for the 
State Support of the Maritime Kray Economy in 1993-1995" set 
electricity rates for industrial consumers at 40 rubles per 
kilowatt-hour, and the wholesale price for coal at the level for 
June the previous year--1,141 rubles a tonne. As a result, 
prices in power engineering were only 7.1 times as high at the 
end of the year as at the beginning, and the price of coal did 
not rise after October of last year, although the overall rise 
in wholesale prices in the basic industries was 10-12 times. 
This has had an adverse effect on the financial status of coal 
and power engineering facilities. 
  Freight transport rates were 20 times as high in 1993 as in 
1992, including 21 times for maritime transport and 11 times for 
motor transport. 
<H5>  Social Sphere </H5>
  The population of the kray was around 2,287,000 on 1 January 
1994 (77 percent urban). In the past year it decreased by almost 
15,000 (two-thirds of the decrease was the result of natural 
attrition). The birth rate decreased by 15 percent, but the 
death rate, on the contrary, rose 25 percent. 
  In 1993 more than 17,000 people in Maritime Kray got married 
and almost 13,000 marriages broke up. Young adults represented 
the highest percentage of those getting married and those 
getting divorced--women from 20 to 24 and men from 25 to 34 
after 5-9 years of living together. 
  The kray is still accepting refugees and people who have had 
to move out of regions racked by ethnic conflicts. The recorded 
number on 1 January this year was 1,725 (711 families), which is 
almost triple the figure for the beginning of last year. 
  Around a million workers and employees work in all branches 
of the economy. The proportional number of people employed in 
nonproduction branches was higher than it had been the previous 
year (almost 27 percent). 
  Although the rate of officially registered unemployment was 
relatively low--0.5 percent (6,966 people), in comparison with 
the Russian average of 0.85 percent, there was more hidden 
unemployment, taking the form of part-time employment, 
obligatory unpaid leaves, etc. 
  The monetary income of the population was 
estimated at 1.3033 trillion rubles for the year and was 14 
times as high as the figure for the previous year. 
  Monetary income in December was 41 percent higher than it 
had 
been the previous month and 19.4 times as high as it had been 
the previous December, but the respective increases after 
adjustments for rising prices were only 22 percent and 71 
percent. 
  The population spent 62 percent of its total income (68 
percent the previous year) on goods and services and 13 percent 
(10 percent the previous year) on taxes and various fees, 
deposited 5.7 percent (3.8 percent in 1992) in bank accounts, 
and acquired state bonds worth 118.1 million rubles and Russian 
Federation certificates worth 38.2 million rubles. The increase 
in personal deposits in branches of the Savings Bank was 42.4 
billion rubles, and the figure for commercial banks was 22.3 
billion rubles. The respective account balances on 1 January 
1994 were 52 billion rubles and 23.3 billion rubles, or 5.4 
times and 22.7 times the figures for 1 January 1993. 
  The population had over 255 billion rubles (20 percent of 
all 
income) in cash on hand at the end of the year. The reduction of 
available cash was covered constantly by the issuance of new 
currency, amounting to 263.2 billion rubles during the year 
(13.8 times as much as in 1992). The average monthly income of 
one worker in December was 244,400 rubles. It was 10.9 times as 
high as in December 1992 and 43 percent higher than in November 
1993. 
  The personnel of cultural establishments were on an unequal 
level. Their average monthly income in December was 132,000 
rubles, or 54 percent of the kray average. The respective 
figures for other spheres were 150,400 rubles and 62 percent for 
science, 141,900 rubles and 58 percent for public education, and 
175,400 rubles and 72 percent for public health. 
  The personnel of finance and credit establishments had an 
average monthly income of 865,700 rubles in December, or 3.5 
times the kray average. The significant difference was due to 
the income of commercial bank personnel. 
  Consumer market for goods and services: Consumer 
goods worth 705.3 billion rubles were produced in the kray 
during the year. This was 11.2 percent below the 1992 figure (in 
comparable prices). 
  The output of food and non-food items decreased in physical 
terms. The output of alcoholic beverages was 6.2 percent above 
the 1992 figure. 
  More than three-fourths of all consumer goods are food 
products (79 percent). The output of all of the products 
included in the minimum consumer budget was smaller than in 
1992. There were particularly perceptible decreases in the 
output of canned fish--48 percent, and of noodles, cereals, 
canned fruits and vegetables, margarine and whole-milk dairy 
products, bread and baked goods--24-28 percent. 
  There was a significant reduction (19 percent) in the output 
of non-food items, particularly the products of light industry 
(35 percent). The main reason for the unstable work of these 
enterprises was the shortage of working capital and difficulties 
in selling products as a result of the stronger emphasis in 
public demand on food products and of the larger supply of 
imported goods. 
  After household appliances and radios were unable to compete 
with imported equipment in the market, the output of radios was 
reduced by half and the output of washing machines was reduced 
by almost one-fourth. 
  The output of furniture in the kray was 13 percent below 
last 
year's figure, the output of china and pottery was 14 percent 
below, the output of facial soap was 32 percent below, and the 
output of household soap was 29 percent below. 
  The following data are indicators of the output of some 
non-food items: 


Products                       1993                     1993 in % of 1992 

Refrigerators                  104,837                  1.6 times 

Radios                         54,481                   50 

Washing machines               64,005                   76 

Furniture, millions of         27,944                   87 
rubles (existing prices) 

Sewing machines, millions of   14,397                   37 
rubles (actual existing 
prices) 

Knitwear, thousands of items   2,213                    49 


Footwear, thousands of pairs   707                      82 


Children's footwear            162                      63 

Household soap, tonnes         8,584                    71 

Facial soap, tonnes            3,488                    68 


  Retail commodity turnover at officially registered trade 
enterprises was 636.6 billion rubles in 1993, or 10.2 times the 
1992 figure in actual prices. The sales volume decreased by 17.8 
percent in physical terms. 
  The population bought 365.9 billion rubles' worth of food 
(57.5 percent of all commodity turnover). 
  The reduction of sales volume in physical terms was recorded 
everywhere in the kray but the cities of Dalnegorsk and 
Ussuriysk. Sales of butter, tea, and liquor through the official 
network decreased by 20 percent and sales of meat and poultry, 
sausage, fish, eggs, sugar, potatoes, and vegetables through 
this network decreased by 40 percent because of high prices, 
inadequate supplies, and other reasons. 
  The official trade network had to compete with sales in the 
"free trade" sphere, with an estimated sales volume of 140 
billion rubles. This sphere was distinguished by brisk trade in 
alcoholic beverages, ice cream, fruit, and confectionery 
(especially imported candy). The number of markets selling 
clothing increased. The private market (including the consumer 
cooperative network and "free trade") took over much of the 
business of the state network. Its share decreased from 66 
percent in 1992 to 54 percent. In spite of all difficulties 
(common to the state network and the private market), the 
financial results of the private market were much more 
impressive. 
  At the beginning of the year and in the last two months of 
the year, meat was in short supply in one out of every four 
rayons or cities, there was an egg shortage in one out of every 
three, and sales of potatoes and vegetables were sporadic in 
Vladivostok and in Kirovskiy, Olginskiy, Oktyabrskiy, and 
Chuguyevskiy rayons. Sales of potatoes and vegetables decreased 
by 31 percent and 22 percent respectively in comparison with 
1992 figures. Average per capita sales for the year amounted to 
14 kilograms of potatoes, 13 kilograms of vegetables, and around 
5 kilograms of fruit. This is far below recommended dietary 
standards. 
  The population of rayons equivalent to the Far North in 
terms 
of delivery conditions had difficulty acquiring consumer goods 
last year. 
  There were shortages of seasonal items for adults and 
children, sporting goods, and toys for preschoolers and 
school-age children in the consumer market for nonfood items 
during the year. Sales of radios and electrical appliances were 
sporadic. 
  Reserve commodity stocks on 1 December were estimated at 
131.6 billion rubles, sufficient for 36 days of trade, or 9 days 
less than the previous December. Most of the stocks were 
concentrated at enterprises of the state trade network--78.4 
billion rubles (59.6 percent), the consumer cooperative 
network--26.6 billion rubles (20.2 percent), and private trade 
enterprises--24.5 billion rubles (18.6 percent). Reserve 
commodity stocks in Khorolskiy and Kirovskiy rayons and in 
Lesozavodsk and Partizansk were far below the kray average. 
  The commodity turnover of officially registered enterprises 
in the food service industry was 33 billion rubles, or 7.2 
percent below the 1992 figure (in comparable prices). Sales of 
their own products amounted to 21.3 billion rubles, or 4.3 
percent below the 1992 figure. 
  Paid services were performed for 102.6 billion 
rubles, which was 12 times as high as the figure for the 
previous year. The sales volume for paid services in physical 
terms was 55.3 percent below the previous year's figure. 
Enterprises in the state and municipal sector accounted for more 
than 83 percent of the total sales volume. The share of private 
enterprises is still negligible. 
  Housing and cultural-consumer construction: New 
residential buildings with a total area of 449,900 square 
meters, or 7,384 apartments, were completed last year, including 
52,500 square meters, or 723 apartments, in rural communities. 
The total amount of new housing was only slightly below last 
year's figure, by 300 square meters. 
  State enterprises and organizations were responsible for the 
construction of 54.4 percent of all new housing, joint-stock 
companies were responsible for 28.2 percent, economic 
partnerships were responsible for 9.7 percent, the population 
built 5.6 percent at its own expense or with state credit, and 
cooperatives built 0.8 percent. Annual housing start projections 
were fulfilled by 54.5 percent. Private residential construction 
rose slightly, accounting for 5.6 percent of the total. The 
amount of new housing in the following locations was below last 
year's figures: the cities of Artem, Vladivostok, Lesozavodsk, 
Dalnegorsk, and Bolshoy Kamen, and Anuchinskiy, Kavalerovskiy, 
Kirovskiy, Lazovskiy, Lesozavodskiy, Partizanskiy, 
Mikhaylovskiy, Pogranichnyy, Terneyskiy, Ussuriyskiy, 
Khankayskiy, Khasanskiy, and Khorolskiy rayons. The amount of 
new housing was more than double the figures for last year, 
however, in the following locations: the cities of Arsenyev and 
Dalnerechensk and Spasskiy, Chuguyevskiy, and Oktyabrskiy rayons. 
  New schools were opened for 2,546 students (79.8 percent of 
the previous year's figure), as well as new kindergartens for 
330 children (15.6 percent), polyclinics for 325 patients a day 
(78.3 percent), and clubs to accommodate 950 people. There were 
no new hospitals or vocational and technical institutes. Capital 
investments amounting to 12.1 billion rubles, or 87.5 percent of 
the previous year's figure, were used for the construction of 
basic facilities in the public utilities sector. These included 
10.69 kilometers of water lines, pumping stations for 3,000 
cubic meters of water a day, 0.4 kilometers of sewer lines, 
heating supply systems for 22.45 Gcal, and 17.42 kilometers of 
heat supply lines. 
  The main reason for the reduction of social construction 
projects in comparison with the previous year was the shortage 
of funds in local budgets and of clients. Federal budget 
allocations were extremely late in arriving and were 60-70 
percent of the promised amounts. 
  Public health: Outbreaks of several infectious 
diseases were recorded in the kray in 1993. There were 978 cases 
of diphtheria (16 times as many as in 1992), 1,701 cases of 
measles (20 times as many), 574 cases of whooping cough (2.8 
times as many), and 5,031 cases of viral hepatitis (1.4 times as 
many). 
  The rates of pediculosis (lice)--9,124 cases, as compared to 
8,429 in 1992, scabies (3.2 times the previous rate), 
syphilis--2.7 times the previous rate, and gonorrhea--1.2 times 
the previous rate--are still disturbing. 
  The number of reported cases of severe upper respiratory 
infections was the same as in 1992, and the number of cases of 
influenza was only one-third as high. 
  Education: There were 714 general education day 
schools, two schools attached to higher academic institutions 
(the academy of the Far Eastern Technology Institute and the 
business college of the Far Eastern State University), and 12 
private schools at the beginning of the 1993/94 academic year. 
  The curriculum of 147 of the schools offers intensive 
courses 
in various subjects, including five preparatory schools and 
three academies. 
  There were 39,500 new admissions to the first grade in state 
schools in the new academic year, and 2,500 of the children are 
attending preschool institutions. In addition, 256 others are 
doing course work in first-grade classes. 
  Just as in the last academic year, one out of every three 
schoolchildren attends a second or third shift, and the number 
of students in the third shift decreased by 8.7 percent. 
  In 1993, 17,200 students graduated from kray schools with a 
secondary school diploma, and 2,400 of them were simultaneously 
employed in the production sphere. 
  Vocational training was offered by 65 vocational and 
technical institutes, two of which (the Nakhodka Polytechnical 
College and the Vladivostok Liberal Arts and Engineering 
College) train specialists with a secondary specialized 
education. At the end of the year there were 23,800 students 
enrolled in vocational and technical institutes. During the year 
they trained 12,300 skilled workers. 
  Specialists with a higher and secondary specialized 
education 
are trained at 10 higher academic institutions and 36 secondary 
specialized academic institutions (including two colleges 
attached to vocational and technical institutes). Their 
respective enrollment figures at the beginning of the academic 
year were 41,100 and 27,900. 
  The number of specialists with a higher and secondary 
specialized education trained for the national economy in the 
1992/93 year was 7,200. The respective numbers of full-time 
students were 5,200 and 4,800. 
  The problem of placing graduates in jobs became much more 
acute. According to the data of academic institutions, 65.4 
percent of the graduates of higher academic institutions and 
55.6 percent of the graduates of secondary specialized 
institutions were placed in jobs, and the rest found jobs on 
their own. 
  Environmental protection: Capital investments in 
environmental protection and resource conservation projects 
amounted to more than 3.137 billion rubles, or 0.9 percent of 
all capital investments. This was 57.8 percent below the 1992 
figure. 
  Ecological conditions were as unsatisfactory last year as in 
previous years. The highest levels of air pollution were 
recorded in Vladivostok, Artem, and Spassk-Dalniy and in 
Pozharskiy Rayon. 
  There were 144 sudden accidental discharges and emissions 
during the year, including 74 accidental discharges into water 
resources. The resulting environmental damages amounted to 248.5 
million rubles. 
  Administrative actions were taken against 492 officials and 
citizens for violations of environmental laws, with the 
imposition of 16.1 million rubles in fines. Enterprises were 
sued for 708.5 million rubles for violations of this kind. 
  Administrative actions were taken against 734 officials and 
citizens for violations of laws protecting flora and fauna and 
of fishing regulations, including 14.4 million rubles in fines. 
  There were 284 forest fires on 11,300 hectares during the 
year. They consumed or damaged 52,200 cubic meters of timber 
stands. Timber losses were estimated at 77.4 million rubles. 
  Crime: There were 77,200 reported crimes in 1993, 
or 6.8 percent more than in 1992. The crime rate rose in almost 
all rayons of the kray. The number of crimes increased more than 
1.3-fold in Lazovskiy, Krasnoarmeyskiy, Kavalerovskiy, and 
Chuguyevskiy rayons. 
  Just as before, the majority of crimes (53.2 percent) were 
committed against the personal property of citizens. There were 
32,600 reported thefts of the personal property of citizens 
during the year, and around half were home burglaries. The 
number of robberies and muggings increased by 7 percent and 29 
percent respectively. 
  The number of felonies rose by 23.2 percent. One out of 
every 
five crimes was a felony. There were 754 homicides and attempted 
homicides, 1,704 cases of intentional infliction of serious 
bodily injury, and 266 rapes during the year. 
  The investigated crimes included 8,066 group crimes (an 
increase of 14.9 percent), 6,000 crimes committed by juveniles 
or with their participation, and 13,200 crimes committed in a 
state of intoxication. 
  Law enforcement agencies instituted criminal proceedings 
against 20,100 people during the year. The proportional number 
of solved crimes rose to 43 percent. 
<H5>  Material Resources </H5>
  The kray economy had difficulty acquiring supplies of all 
types of material and technical resources last year, 
particularly petroleum products, fuel, and thermal and 
electrical power. 
  The main reasons were the recession, the disruption of 
economic ties within Russia and with nearby foreign states, the 
higher shipping costs, the institution of advance payments for 
goods, and the insolvency of enterprises. The lack of financial 
resources precluded the accumulation of sufficient reserves of 
fuel for the heating season, which led to an energy crisis at 
the end of the year. 
  Fuel conservation reduced the output of electrical and 
thermal power. The shortages of these affected industrial 
enterprises and the population of the kray. 
  There were six commercial exchanges operating in the kray in 
1993. They conducted 545 trading sessions and concluded 2,250 
transactions. Total turnover in the exchanges was 468.8 billion 
rubles. The proportional amount of transactions in the sale of 
goods for production and technical use, however, did not amount 
to even 1 percent of the total. Consequently, the exchanges had 
virtually no effect on the supply of material resources in the 
kray economy. 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  Enterprises, joint-stock companies, and partnerships of all 
forms of ownership produced goods worth 1.165 trillion rubles in 
existing prices in 1993, which was 6.8 times the indicator for 
1992. The physical volume of industrial production was 16.5 
percent smaller than the previous year's, including a reduction 
of 22.2 percent in December. 
  No branch of industry reached the 1992 production level. The 
payment crisis had its most severe effects on enterprises in the 
chemical industry, light industry, and the construction 
industry, where the reduction of output since 1992 was 48 
percent, 32 percent, and 27 percent respectively. The reduction 
of output was less sizable (up to 10 percent) in electrical 
power engineering, the fuel industry, the timber and woodworking 
industry, and the food industry, including the fish industry. 
  There were work stoppages in some production units at an 
average of 10-12 enterprises a month during the year because of 
shortages of crude resources, materials, fuel, electricity, and 
components and the insolvency of consumers. These losses 
amounted to 327,500 man-days during the year and cost the kray 
37 billion rubles. 
  More than half of all the year's losses were caused by 
difficulties in selling products (52.6 percent). 
  The fuel and energy complex produced 11.987 million tonnes 
of 
coal, 10.22 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, and 6.357 
million gigacalories of thermal power during the year, which was 
5-8 percent below the previous year's production levels. 
  In machine building and metalworking the decrease in 
production output stayed within the limits common to this branch 
throughout the year--16 percent. Machine building's contribution 
to kray production output was reduced by the effects of the 
conversion of enterprises of the defense complex, where the 
output was almost 20 percent smaller than in 1992. The 
production of civilian goods did not compensate for the reduced 
output of military products because the civilian output was also 
reduced. While the reduction of military output was equivalent 
to 16 percent, civilian output decreased by 22 percent. 
  The increase in social construction projects and private 
residential construction during the year increased the demand 
for the products of the construction materials industry, 
including cement. The slump in cement production was equivalent 
to only 47.5 percent by the end of the year, as compared to 82 
percent at the beginning of the year. 
  The slump in the production of building brick became less 
pronounced, decreasing from 36 percent in the first half of the 
year to 24 percent by the end of the year. The respective 
figures for prefabricated reinforced concrete structures were 32 
percent and 26 percent. 
  The timber and woodworking industry continued to suffer from 
a slump in the production of commercial timber, plywood, lumber, 
particle board, and fiberboard. 
  The catch of fish and other sea food in the fish industry 
was 
13 percent below the previous year's figure, which reduced the 
output of canned goods by almost half and the output of 
commercial fish products by 2 percent. 
  The denationalization of enterprises continued in industry 
last year. On 1 January 1994 almost one out of every four large 
and medium-sized industrial enterprises had been transferred to 
private and mixed forms of ownership. They accounted for 16 
percent of the industrial product. Non-governmental forms of 
ownership are most common in light industry, the food industry, 
metalworking, and the construction materials industry. 
  The largest reduction in output for the year (18 percent) 
was 
recorded at federally owned enterprises, and the reduction at 
kray-owned enterprises was 17 percent. Municipal enterprises and 
enterprises in the non-governmental ownership categories 
(private and mixed) experienced a minimal reduction in output--4 
percent in relation to the 1992 figure. 
<H5>  Capital Construction </H5>
  Investment dynamics were increasingly sluggish. Capital 
investments in 1990 were 4.7 times as high as in 1993 
(investments in 1991 were 3.8 times as high and investments in 
1992 were 1.3 times as high). Investments last year totaled 
354.8 billion rubles. The amount contributed by state 
enterprises and organizations to total capital investments was 
176.9 billion rubles (49.9 percent), joint-stock companies 
contributed 143.5 billion rubles (40.4 percent), and economic 
partnerships contributed 14.9 billion rubles (4.2 percent). 
  Enterprises and organizations of all forms of ownership used 
89.8 billion rubles in centralized investments during the year, 
including 53.7 billion rubles from the federal budget (54 
percent of the previous year's figure) and 36 billion rubles 
from the local budget (87.6 percent). 
  In spite of the severe fuel and energy crisis in Maritime 
Kray, investments in electrical power engineering were 36.6 
percent below the previous year's figure and amounted to 21.7 
billion rubles. The respective figures for the coal industry 
were 51.4 percent and 23.7 billion rubles. Investments also 
displayed a sizable decline in a branch of such vital importance 
as the medical industry (17 percent in relation to the previous 
year's figure) and in the construction industry (27.6 percent). 
  Capital investments in the agroindustrial complex were 46 
percent below the previous year's figure and amounted to 86.8 
billion rubles, including a decrease of 53 percent in 
centralized capital investments. The establishment of peasant 
and family farms cost 703 million rubles, or 0.8 percent of all 
capital investments in the agroindustrial complex. 
  The only branch of the kray economy experiencing a 
significant increase in investment (more than sevenfold) in 
comparison with the previous year's figure was maritime 
transport. 
  New fixed capital acquired in 1993 by enterprises and 
organizations of all forms of ownership cost 158.3 billion 
rubles, including 124.3 billion rubles for production 
facilities. Capacities were incorporated for the production of a 
million tonnes of coal at the Pavlovsk Coal Mine and for the 
production of datolite ore at the Bor Production Association; 
295.5 kilometers of 500-watt power transmission lines 
(Chuguyevka-PrimGRES [Maritime Kray Regional State Electrical 
Power Plant]) were installed, telephone service was automated 
for 10,200 telephones in Vladivostok and 1,500 in Novopokrovka, 
a shop was opened for the production of 3 million standard cans 
of fruit and vegetables at the Dalnerechensk Meat Combine, and 
several other facilities were established. Only two, however, of 
the 11 top-priority, budget-financed projects were completed. 
  Because of the substantial difference between the amount of 
capital investments used and the incorporation of fixed capital 
in the kray, the volume of unfinished construction increased 
dramatically and amounted to around 600 billion rubles, or 169 
percent of all capital investments used (as compared to the 
standard 70 percent). 
  The market for unfinished construction projects is still in 
the formative stage, and the demand for these facilities is 
negligible. Most of the demand was for unfinished social 
projects in the housing, trade, and food service sectors--9 of 
the 14 sold facilities. Only two production facilities were 
sold: a roofing materials shop and a bank of assembly shops at 
the Askold Plant. 
  Construction organizations of all forms of ownership and 
small enterprises employing fewer than 50 people performed work 
worth 246.3 billion rubles, representing 63.3 percent of last 
year's figure. The proportional amount of work performed by 
state enterprises decreased from 51 percent last year to 16.3 
percent this year. Productivity per worker was 40 percent higher 
in private firms than at state enterprises, average monthly 
wages were 13 percent higher, and average annual profits were 35 
percent higher. 
  The average recorded number of workers was 52,858 during the 
year, or 5,127 below the 1992 figure. Average monthly wages per 
worker during the year were 106,600 rubles, and average wages in 
December were 290,800 rubles. The state of settlements in the 
construction complex grew worse. Indebtedness for work and 
services performed by construction organizations amounted to 
59.752 billion rubles at the beginning of this year. 
<H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>
  The privatization process also extended to transport 
enterprises. Stock was issued first in enterprises of motor 
transport (17 units) and maritime transport (11 units). 
  Privatized enterprises represent 18 percent of the total. 
  The crisis in the kray economy had an adverse effect on 
public transport enterprises--state and privatized. 
  Freight shipments decreased by more than one-fourth. 


Modes of transport           1993, thousands of tonnes   1993 in % of 1992 


Total freight carried        45,042.9                    73.6

  Maritime transport delivered 4.5 million tonnes of cargo to 
regions of the Far North (21 percent less than in 1992). The 
amount of freight shipped by coastal transport decreased 
considerably, and international freight shipments increased 
slightly. 
  Maritime trade ports handled 18.3 million tonnes of cargo, 
including 13.9 million tonnes of exports. Export volume 
increased by a third during the year. The proportional amount of 
export cargo rose from 60 percent of the total to 76 percent, 
and proportional imports decreased from 20 percent to 12 percent. 
  The volume of the main types of freight shipped by rail 
decreased: lumber, cement, petroleum products, chemical and 
mineral fertilizers, and mixed feeds. Cars stood idle for long 
periods on enterprise access roads because of delays in 
unloading. Fines for excessive layover time totaled 557.2 
million rubles during the year. 
  Joint-stock companies carried 98 percent of the freight 
shipped by motor transport. The development of foreign contacts 
contributed to an increase in international shipments by this 
form of transport. During the year motor transport handled 
595,000 tonnes of export and import freight (6 percent of the 
total), which was 63 percent above the figure for 1992. 
  The amount of freight shipped by air decreased on local 
airlines (by 20 percent) and international airlines (25 
percent). The amount of mail carried by air decreased by more 
than a third and the area of serviced agricultural lands and 
forests decreased by 22 percent. All of this was a result of 
high service rates. 
  Public transport carried more than 440 million passengers 
during the year, with municipal enterprises carrying 63 percent 
of the total. In all, passenger traffic increased by 6 percent 
in comparison with the 1992 figure, and passenger transport by 
air decreased by more than a third. Less expensive rail 
transport was preferred by more passengers. 
  Public communications enterprises performed 
services for 30.9 billion rubles during the year (a 13.6-fold 
increase in existing prices). Service rates rose several times 
during the year and were 23 times as high in December as they 
had been in December 1992. 
  The number of telephones increased by 8,165 and reached 
218,600, including the 158,200 phones of the population. 
  The installation of the 154 kilometers of the 60-channel 
Dalnegorsk-Terney cable line was completed, enhancing the 
quality and reliability of interurban telephone service in the 
northern regions. In addition, this will connect all cities and 
rayon centers in the kray to a single automated network. 
  New forms of communication were developed. Three business 
centers offering communication and data processing services, 39 
electronic mail subscription networks, and 775 subscription 
telefax and 13 public telefax services were established. The new 
forms of services produced almost 100 million rubles in income. 
  The subscription campaign for the first half of 1994 
indicated greater interest in subscription publications. 
Subscribers signed up for 1,281,400 copies of newspapers and 
magazines (112 percent of the subscription figures for the 
second half of 1993). This occurred in spite of the fact that 
the average subscription price tripled during this period. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  Last year was marked by substantial structural changes in 
the 
branch. 
  The reregistration of sovkhozes and kolkhozes in accordance 
with the 1992 government decree was completed in the kray. This 
resulted in the establishment of 160 new partnerships of various 
types, 12 new agricultural cooperatives, one new auxiliary farm, 
and 11 new farms of other types. Nine kolkhozes and 40 sovkhozes 
retained their legal status. 
  Around 22,000 hectares of land were allocated for collective 
orchards and 14,000 hectares were allocated for collective 
vegetable gardens. They will be shared by 223,000 and 142,000 
families respectively. 
  The new producer network did not have time to develop during 
the reorganization of farms in the public sector. There was a 
decrease in the output of all of the main agricultural products. 
  The gross product (in 1983 prices) decreased by 7 percent 
and 
amounted to 659.3 million rubles. 
  The product per average annual worker in agriculture was 
6,679 rubles (8 percent below the 1992 figure). According to 
preliminary data, 206 farms will have ended the year with a 
profit, and 37 will have ended the year with losses. Net profits 
will amount to 14.5 billion rubles. 
  On 1 January 1994 there were 4,998 peasant farms with 77,800 
hectares of land (an average of 15.6 hectares per farm). 
  Many family farms (64 percent) received up to 10 hectares of 
land, and 0.9 percent received from 100 to 200 hectares. 
Meanwhile, 598 farms broke up. The highest numbers were in 
Mikhaylovskiy Rayon--20 percent, Chuguyevskiy Rayon--6.5 
percent, Spasskiy Rayon--6 percent, and the city of Artem--8 
percent. 
  The results of the harvest in the kray were disappointing. 
  Ongoing processes in the redistribution of land raised the 
proportion accounted for by private farms in the output of 
potatoes (from 66 percent in 1990 to 83 percent in 1993) and 
vegetables (from 36 to 67 percent). The reasons were the use of 
less mineral and organic fertilizers and pesticides than in 
1992, the shortage of fuel and lubricants, and the inoperability 
of some equipment. 
  The grain output after processing was 359,000 tonnes, 
including 11,000 tonnes of buckwheat and 30,000 tonnes of rice, 
and other output figures were 61,000 tonnes of soybeans, 384,000 
tonnes of potatoes, and 115,000 tonnes of vegetables. The gross 
yield of most agricultural crops in the kray displayed decreases 
ranging from 8 to 41 percent. The yield of potatoes increased by 
4 percent and the yield of vegetables increased by 40 percent. 
  Around 51,100 tonnes of grain were purchased for the state 
supply (28 percent less than in 1992). The lower level of 
compulsory deliveries, however, led to their fulfillment by 
121.6 percent. Sales of cereal crops (buckwheat and rice) 
amounted to around 23,000 tonnes (43 percent less than in 1992), 
sales of potatoes totaled 24,400 tonnes (36 percent less), and 
vegetable sales amounted to 22,900 tonnes (21 percent less). 
  Market relations affected sales channels, reducing the 
portion of the product acquired by the state and increasing the 
portion sold through other channels (the market, produce stands, 
the food service industry, and others). 
  Soybean sales amounted to 15,500 tonnes (48 percent less 
than 
in 1992). Obligatory deliveries of potatoes, vegetables, and 
soybeans were fulfilled by 53-62 percent. 
  In the animal husbandry sector, fewer products came from the 
dairy farms of agricultural enterprises, and the output of the 
private farmyards of citizens simultaneously increased. 
  Sales of livestock and poultry for slaughter in the kray 
decreased by 7,600 tonnes in comparison with the 1992 figure, 
milk sales decreased by 1,400 tonnes, egg sales decreased by 
70.1 million eggs, and the total sales of these products 
amounted to 71,700 tonnes, 276,400 tonnes, and 400.5 million 
units respectively. 
  There were 305,400 head of cattle in the kray on 1 January 
1994 (10 percent less than in 1992), including 126,300 cows (5 
percent less). There were 261,000 pigs (13 percent less). There 
were 21,500 sheep and goats, which was 8 percent higher than the 
1992 figure. 
  Kolkhozes, peasant farms, and workers and employees owned 20 
percent of all the cattle in the kray, 37 percent of the cows, 
41 percent of the pigs, and 94 percent of the sheep and goats. 
Reproduction indicators declined. 
  The rate of epizootic disease in cattle rose on 83 farms, 
the 
rate of disease in pigs increased on 58 farms, the number of new 
calves decreased on 113 farms, and the number of new piglets 
decreased on 80 farms. Milk yield per cow was 65 kilograms more 
than in 1992 and amounted to 1,775 kilograms. The average laying 
hen produced 206 eggs, which was the same as the previous year's 
figure. 
  Many farms did not have an adequate supply of feeds. They 
had 
10.4 quintals of feed units per standard head of livestock, as 
compared to 11.1 units in 1992. Feed supplies were least 
adequate in the city of Artem and in Kavalerovskiy, 
Nadezhdinskiy, and Partizanskiy rayons. The problem is 
compounded by the use of the feeds without preliminary 
processing on most farms because of the inoperability of 
equipment in more than half of the feed shops and feed kitchens 
in several rayons. 
  Purchases of kray products amounted to 29,100 tonnes of 
livestock and poultry (in live weight), 133,000 tonnes of milk, 
and 271 million eggs, which were below the 1992 figures by 9-20 
percent. 
  Substandard livestock and livestock sold through direct 
channels amounted to 11,400 tonnes, representing more than 39 
percent of the total. 
  Private farms sold 2,700 tonnes of livestock (9 percent of 
the total), more than 3,000 tonnes of milk (2.3 percent), and 
600,000 eggs (0.2 percent). 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Relations </H5>
  The kray's foreign trade through direct channels in 1993 
amounted to 695.3 million U.S. dollars, with exports accounting 
for 64 percent of the total. The kray's main foreign trade 
partners are China (43.5 percent of all exports and imports), 
Japan (27 percent), and France (9 percent). 
  Raw materials are still predominant in the structure of 
exports. Exports through direct channels included 115,400 tonnes 
of fish and fish products, 168,500 cubic meters of lumber, 
42,300 tonnes of fertilizer, and 398,000 tonnes of ferrous 
metals. Besides this, 4,700 tonnes of copper ore, 19,000 tonnes 
of boric acid, 630,000 cubic meters of lumber, and 51,700 tonnes 
of fish products were exported through foreign trade 
associations. 
  The main elements of the import structure are consumer 
goods, 
motor vehicles, spare parts, and services performed for our 
enterprises abroad (ship repairs and commercial and transport 
services). 
  Enterprises and organizations in the kray deposited 741.7 
million U.S. dollars in foreign currency accounts, including 
696.5 million dollars for exported goods and services. The 
enterprises spent 735.4 million dollars. The remainder, 
including the balance at the beginning of the year, was 90.5 
million U.S. dollars. 
  The kray received 5,000 tonnes of food and 114 tonnes of 
various types of freight from Japan, the United States, India, 
and South Korea in humanitarian aid.
