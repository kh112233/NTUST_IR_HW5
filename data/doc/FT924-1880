FT  16 DEC 92 / Rabin pursues peace despite kidnap murder
MR YITZHAK RABIN, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday promised a
'merciless' campaign against militant Islamic fundamentalists in the
occupied territories after a paramilitary policeman kidnapped at the weekend
was found murdered by a roadside in the West Bank.
But Mr Rabin told parliament his government would not be diverted by such
acts from its commitment to Middle East peace talks with the Palestinians -
as well as Syria, Jordan and Lebanon - currently going on in Washington.
He was speaking after the body of Border Police Sgt-Major Nissim Toledano
was found bound, strangled and stabbed and dumped close to the road from
Jerusalem to Jericho.
Sgt-Major Toledano was kidnapped early on Sunday by Qassam, the military
wing of the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas, which originally demanded
the release of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas jailed for life by
Israel. Although the government suggested it was prepared to discuss the
demand if it was assured Sgt-Major Toledano was still alive, there was no
further word from the abductors.
Mr Rabin said the kidnap, and the deaths of five other soldiers in the past
week, were intended 'to kill Jews and Israelis and to kill peace'.
In Washington Dr Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the head of the Palestinian delegation,
said the effect of the violence was to 'reduce the credibility of the peace
talks'. Nevertheless, Israel has presented the Palestinians with a revised
agenda aimed at overcoming problems delaying agreement on an interim period
of Palestinian self-rule. It apparently goes some way to meeting Palestinian
demands that UN resolutions calling for an Israeli withdrawal from occupied
lands apply to the interim stage as well as to a final settlement.
International human rights groups and foreign correspondents in Israel
yesterday protested to Mr Rabin over the arrest on Monday night of Mr Taher
Shriteh, the leading resident journalist in the Gaza Strip.
