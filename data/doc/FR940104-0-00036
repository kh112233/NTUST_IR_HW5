SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background


FDA is announcing that, in accordance with section 3(b)(1)(A)(ii), (b)(1)(A)(vi), (b)(1)(A)(x), and (b)(2) of
the 1990 amendments (Pub. L. 101535), as amended by the DS act (Pub. L. 102571), the change in its regulations
that it proposed on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53296 through 53305), to reflect its tentative decision not to authorize
health claims relating an association between dietary fiber and cancer (Docket No. 93N480F); dietary fiber
and CVD (Docket No. 93N480C); antioxidant vitamins and cancer (Docket No. 93N480A); omega-3 fatty
acids and CHD (Docket No. 93N480O); and zinc and immune deficiency in the elderly (Docket No. 93N480Z)
on the labels and in the labeling of dietary supplements is now considered a final regulation.


II. Passage of 1990 Amendments


The 1990 amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services
(the Secretary), and by delegation FDA, the authority to issue regulations authorizing health claims on the labels
and in the labeling of foods. Section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(B)) provides that a product is misbranded
if it bears a claim that characterizes the relationship of a nutrient to a disease or health-related condition, unless
the claim is made in accordance with procedures and standards established under section 403(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D)). 
The 1990 amendments also directed the Secretary to determine through rulemaking whether claims regarding 10 nutrient-disease
relationships meet the requirements of the act. Dietary fiber and cancer, dietary fiber and CVD, antioxidant vitamins
and cancer, zinc and immune function in the elderly, and omega-3 fatty acids and CHD were among the topics that FDA was
directed to evaluate under section 3(b)(1)(A)(vi) and (b)(1)(A)(x) of the 1990 amendments. 

III. The 1991 Health Claims Proposals


In the 

Federal Register

 of November 27, 1991, FDA proposed not to authorize health claims on dietary fiber and CVD (56 FR 60582); dietary fiber
and cancer (56 FR 60566); antioxidant vitamins and cancer (56 FR 60624); zinc and immune function in the elderly (56
FR 60652); and omega-3 fatty acids and CHD (56 FR 60663). The agency tentatively concluded that the available evidence
did not establish that the standard that FDA had proposed for health claims for dietary supplements under section
403(r)(5)(D) of the act was met, that is, the agency tentatively concluded that there was not significant scientific
agreement, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence that these claims are valid.


IV. The Dietary Supplement Act of 1992


In October 1992, the DS act was enacted. This statute imposed a moratorium on FDA's implementation of the 1990 amendments
with respect to dietary supplements until December 15, 1993 (although the DS act did provide that FDA could authorize
claims for dietary supplements before that date). The DS act directed FDA to issue proposed rules to implement the
1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements by June 15, 1993, and to issue final rules based on these proposals
by December 31, 1993. The DS act also amended the so-called ``hammer'' provision of the 1990 amendments, section 3(b)(2)
of the 1990 amendments, to provide that if the agency did not meet the established December 31, 1993, timeframe for
issuance of final rules, the proposed regulations would be considered final regulations. 


V. The 1993 Final Rules For Health Claims For Foods in Conventional Food Form


On January 6, 1993, FDA published final rules on the general requirements for health claims on the labels and in the
labeling of foods in conventional food form (58 FR 2478), and final rules authorizing health claims on seven nutrient-disease
relationships (calcium and osteoporosis; fat and cancer; saturated fat and cholesterol and CHD; fiber-containing
grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer; fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber and
risk of CHD; and fruits and vegetables and cancer). Three of the health claims that FDA authorized were for fresh fruits
and vegetables and grains, and thus these claims were not authorized for dietary supplements. Because of the DS act,
FDA took no final action with respect to the use on dietary supplements of health claims on dietary fiber and cancer;
dietary fiber and CVD; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; zinc and immune function in the elderly; and antioxidant vitamins
and cancer. (The agency's actions with respect to health claims involving folic acid and neural tube defects are described
in a notice published elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

.)


VI. The 1993 Proposal to Not Authorize Health Claims For Dietary Supplements


On October 14, 1993, FDA published a proposal to not authorize health claims on the labels of dietary supplements on
five nutrient-disease relationships: Dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and
cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; and zinc and immune function in the elderly (58 FR 53296). FDA provided 60 days
for comment on this proposed action. Thus, the comment period closed on December 13, 1993. 
Section 3(b)(2) of the 1990 amendments, as amended by section 202(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the DS act, provides that if the
Secretary does not promulgate final regulations on any of the health claims applicable to dietary supplements in
a timely manner, the proposed regulations shall be considered final regulations but not until after December 31,
1993. FDA did not issue final regulations on the use of health claims on dietary supplements on dietary fiber and cancer;
dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; and zinc and immune function
in the elderly by December 31, 1993. Therefore, FDA is issuing this document announcing that by operation of law, the
change in its regulations that FDA proposed to reflect a decision not to authorize health claims about the relationships
of dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD;
and zinc and immune function in the elderly, published in the October 14, 1993, 

Federal Register

, is now considered a final regulation by operation of law. The agency proposed that 21 CFR part 101 be amended as follows:



PART 101_FOOD LABELING


2. Section 101.71 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows:



101.71 

Health claims: claims not authorized.


Health claims not authorized for foods in conventional food form or for dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals,
herbs, or other similar substances:


* * * * *


The 1990 amendments state that FDA is to promptly publish notice of the new status of the proposed change in its regulations
in the 

Federal Register

. This notice is issued in response to that requirement.
The agency notes that this rulemaking constitutes a separate rulemaking from that instituted with respect to the
five nutrient-disease relationships on October 14, 1993. This separate rulemaking was contemplated by Congress
if a final rule was not issued by December 31, 1993. The agency notes, however, that the October 14, 1993, rulemaking
remains ongoing. 
In particular, with regard to antioxidant vitamins and cancer, on November 1 through 3, 1993, FDA held a public conference
on this nutrient-disease relationship. (The conference also covered antioxidant vitamins and CVD.) The transcript
of that meeting has been submitted to the Docket as a comment, and other comments were solicited in the announcement
of the conference (58 FR 54595, October 22, 1993). FDA intends to consider all comments and data received at this conference.
FDA intends to take any actions that it concludes are warranted by this information either in the ongoing rulemaking
on an antioxidant vitamins and cancer claim for dietary supplements or, if the agency concludes that it is appropriate,
in a separate rulemaking.
