<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of a worldwide, limited field of use, exclusive
license to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Application Number 07/906,716, entitled ``Method for
Viral-Proofing a Protective Barrier,'' to White Knight Health Care Inc., having a place of business in Ashville,
North Carolina. The patent rights in these inventions have been assigned to the United States of America. Foreign
patent applications are pending for the subject U.S. Patent Application. 


The prospective license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C. 209 and
37 CFR 404.7. The field of use for the proposed license will be health care worker protective clothing such as gowns,
surgical masks, and surgical drapes. The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within sixty (60)
days from the date of this published notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the
grant of the exclusive license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
This invention relates to methods of producing viral proof barriers such as surgical gowns, drapes, and the like.
