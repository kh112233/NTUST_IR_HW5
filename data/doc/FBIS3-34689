  [Text] Palestine President Yasir 'Arafat left Amman this 
afternoon after a short visit and talks with his majesty the 
king. The Palestinian president briefed his majesty on 
yesterday's agreement with Israel on security issues that have 
blocked the start of Palestinian self-rule. 
  The king and Mr. 'Arafat met at the Queen Alia Airport 
outside Amman, where the Palestinian president handed his 
majesty a copy of the agreement. His majesty reaffirmed 
Jordan's absolute and unchanging support of the Palestinian 
people to regain their rights on their national soil. The two 
leaders then held a closed door meeting for further discussions 
of bilateral ties and regional developments. Following the 
talks, his majesty the king said coordination with the 
Palestinians was rising to the required level, while President 
'Arafat urged the need for joint action with Jordan.

  [Husayn] We are very happy indeed that we have had this 
opportunity presented today by the visit of my brother President 
'Arafat. And he has been kind enough to come and explain to us 
all that has happened. And I believe that we are witnessing the 
emergence of a strong mechanism, hopefully of coordination on 
all issues. And I had the opportunity to reiterate our total 
support for our Palestinian brethren under the leadership of the 
president, and our very strong commitment on top of desire to 
help and support in any way we can the process in the difficult 
times ahead. 
  ['Arafat] We stress upon this very important the relation 
between the one Jordanian-Palestinian family under his 
supervision and under his auspices. [sentence as heard] And we 
have to strengthen more and more our coordination in all fields. 
  ['Assaf] When do you expect to sign a final agreement on 
Gaza 
and Jericho? When do you plan to enter Gaza and Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] Still, there is some issues has to be discussed 
between the two committees, especially those issues which are 
still discussion in Taba and in the Economic Committee in Paris. 
And after that, we hope that in the end of this month, we hope 
that we have something to make the final draft, which will be 
signed by me and Mr. Rabin. [end recording]
