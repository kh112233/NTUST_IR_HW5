FT  04 MAR 93 / 44-tonne road/rail lorries on agenda
6 tonnes more than the present 38-tonne limit - will be allowed on Britain's
roads under proposals published by the government yesterday.
But the increase will only apply to lorries using special types of trailers
that transfer to rail wagons for the long-distance section of their journey.
The proposals hope to arrest the decline of rail freight by encouraging
so-called combined transport operations which use a combination of road and
rail to get goods to their destination.
Although combined transport has made headway on the Continent, it has had
little success in Britain because typical freight journeys are too short to
justify the handling costs of switching loads from road to rail and back.
The government hopes a weight concession will encourage greater use of
combined transport in Britain, particularly at a time when the Channel
tunnel is about to open up much longer freight routes to the Continent.
British Rail was yesterday committed for trial after an accident in which 25
people were injured. BR representatives appeared before magistrates in Leeds
charged with two counts of failing to ensure safety on May 22 last year.
