North Atlantic Right Whale Protection 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce.



 
</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR). 


 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This document is in response to a petition requesting the issuance of regulations that will establish specific protection
zones around every northern right whale (as well as around all other whales). It solicits public comment and information
to assist in determining the need for and types of conservation measures that would be effective in minimizing human-induced
disturbance of and harmful interaction with northern right whales.

DATES:

 Written comments must be received on or before February 27, 1995.

ADDRESSES:

 Comments on this ANPR should be addressed to Chief, Marine Mammal Division, Office of Protected Resources, National
Marine Fisheries Service, 1315 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 


The western North Atlantic population of northern right whales (

Eubalaena

 

glacialis

) is estimated to consist of 300350 animals. Although protected by international agreements for over 50 years,
the growth rate of this population remains at an extremely low level relative to the growth rates of right whale populations
in the southern hemisphere that have been similarly protected (Kraus, 1990). It has been suggested that both natural
and human-induced factors are responsible for the absence of measurable growth in the northern right whale population.

One human-induced factor thought to be a substantial threat to the recovery of the northern right whale, as identified
in the Recovery Plan for Northern Right Whales (NMFS, 1991), developed under section 4(f) of the Endangered Species
Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1533(f), is disturbance by vessels. Northern right whale behavior occurring at the water's surface,
such as resting, skim feeding, and courtship, makes them susceptible to disturbance by vessels. Further, it appears
that vessel traffic has a measurable effect on large whales, including right whales. These effects include overt
changes in direction of swimming, changes in respiration patterns, changes in dive time/surface time ratios, and
changes in acoustic behaviors. In particular, right whale cows with calves and single long-diving whales appear
to be sensitive to sound and have been observed to avoid boats (Kraus and Mayo, unpubl. data). Finally, turbulence
associated with vessel traffic may also indirectly affect northern right whales by breaking up the dense surface
zooplankton patches in certain whale feeding areas. 
On October 5, 1994, NMFS received a petition from Greenworld, Inc. requesting that, in order to address this perceived
problem, NMFS issue regulations establishing a 500yard (yd) (460 meter(m)) radius protection zone around
every right whale and, citing the similarity of appearance provision of section 4(e) of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. 1533(e),
a 100yd (90m) radius protection zone around all other whales. The petition also suggested that any vessel approach
of a right whale closer than 500yds (or 100yds for other whales) be considered an incidental take under
the ESA. 
NMFS has previously received information suggesting similar actions. During the comment period following the proposed
rule to designate critical habitat for the right whale (final rule at 59 FR 28793, June 3, 1994), several commenters
recommended that a distance buffer be established around each right whale. To allow whales to avoid oncoming vessels
and vessels to avoid whales, commenters indicated that, at the time of critical habitat designation, restrictions
or modifications of shipping lanes and shipping practices needed to be made. Another commenter suggested that a minimum
vessel approach distance of 100300m be established around right whales. Finally, a commenter recommended
that NMFS establish a 500m radius protection zone around every right whale in every area designated as critical habitat,
and prohibit any person from knowingly entering or remaining within this zone. This commenter noted that such a buffer
would be consistent with rules already adopted by NMFS, citing, as examples, the minimum distance rules for humpback
whales (

Megaptera

 

novaeangliae

) in Hawaii (50 CFR 222.31) and the 5.5km (5500m) zone established around Steller sea lion rookeries and major haulouts
in Alaska (50 CFR 226.12). The commenter further explained that right whale protective zones for the areas proposed
to be designated as critical habitat in Cape Cod Bay and Stellwagen Bank would be consistent with existing Massachusetts
regulations (322 CMR 12.00 

et

 

seq

.), which implement a 500yd buffer zone between right whales and vessels and prohibit activities of vessels
that negatively impact right whales within Massachusetts waters. (Critical habitat for the northern right whale
was designated by final rule published on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28793).) 
In light of the petition and comments, NMFS is soliciting information from the public which confirms or rebuts the
proposition that disturbance from directed vessel interaction, other than collisions, can cause harm to right whales
that is detrimental to recovery of the species. Assuming disturbance from vessel interaction may be harmful, NMFS
seeks suggestions of appropriate measures to minimize the harmful effects of directed vessel interactions on northern
right whales, including possible exceptions and variations.
