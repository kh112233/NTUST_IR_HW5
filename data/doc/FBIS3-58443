  [Text] The National Defense Ministry today denied press 
reports that there have been violations of the air traffic 
regulations in the Athens Flight Information Region as well as 
of the national airspace in the northern Aegean and specifically 
in the area of Thasos island. The National Defense Ministry 
statement made it clear that air traffic regulations had been 
violated south of Limnos and the established practice to deal 
with them was followed. 
  The issue has been given broad coverage in the Turkish press 
as it was linked to the underwater drilling being conducted near 
Thasos for the exploration of oil. But in an attempt to defuse 
the issue, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel admitted that the 
drilling is being conducted in Greek territorial waters. 
However, Demirel added that if the explorations extend beyond 
Greece's territorial waters there might be complications, since 
no agreement has been reached on the question of the Aegean 
continental shelf. 
  The Turkish Foreign Ministry denied through its spokesman 
that Greece's underwater drilling east of Thasos causes tension 
in Greek-Turkish relations.
