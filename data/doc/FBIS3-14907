  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 28, BNS -- Illegal weapons trade 
between Estonia and Russia has increased of late, Director 
General of the Estonian Security Police Juri Pihl admitted at a 
press conference today. 
  Pihl said the current trend is that weapons from the former 
East European countries, a remarkable part of them manufactured 
in Western countries, are taken through Estonia to Russia. This 
is a reversal of the earlier situation when the arms traffic was 
directed from Russia through Estonia to third countries, the 
director said. 
  In recent weeks both Estonian and Russian officials have 
seized great amounts of arms being illegally taken into Russia. 
  In the course of a joint operation of the Security Police 
and 
the Defense Forces on Feb. 21, for example, over 500 TT 
[Tokarev] pistols were discovered in south Estonia near the 
Luhamaa border crossing. Another illegal arms consignment was 
discovered on the same day by Russian customs officials.
