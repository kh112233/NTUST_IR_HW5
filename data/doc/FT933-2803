FT  16 SEP 93 / Egypt to hang two Moslem militants
AN EGYPTIAN military court sentenced two Moslem militants to hang and four
to life imprisonment yesterday for trying to assassinate an army general,
Reuter reports from Cairo.
The controversial military courts have now condemned 27 militants to death
since President Hosni Mubarak resorted to them last December to ensure swift
punishment for militants carrying out acts of violence aimed at toppling the
government.
Fifteen of the condemned men have been hanged, five are in custody and seven
are fugitives.
The two sentenced to death by a three-judge court in Cairo yesterday were
among eight accused of trying to kill army General Osman Shahin in an ambush
in Cairo on July 18.
The general escaped unhurt but six people, including a policeman and a
militant, were killed in a shootout.
The young men were members of the militant el-Gama'a el-Islamiya (Islamic
Group) which has claimed responsibility for many of the bomb attacks in
Egypt's worst political violence for a decade.
Egypt has been criticised by human rights groups in recent months for
carrying out its largest wave of executions for political crimes in decades.
At least 193 people have now been killed in political violence since March
last year and 510 injured. The Dollars 3bn tourism industry has been
devastated by militant attacks.
