  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The number of resettlers entering 
Germany dropped considerably last year. Horst Waffenschmidt, 
the commissioner for resettlers' affairs at the Interior 
Ministry, said today in Bonn that in 1993 only 218,888 
resettlers came to Germany. In 1992, the figure was 230,565. 
Compared with last year, the number of applicants for admission 
dropped by over 161,000. 
  While the number of applications received from Poland and 
Romania continues to decline considerably, Waffenschmidt said, 
applications from the former Soviet Union were around 37 percent 
lower than last year. The state secretary pointed out that a 
large number of people granted admission documents have not 
emigrated to Germany. A growing number of Russian ethnic 
Germans from Kazakhstan and other CIS republics emigrated to 
Russia in 1993. 
  This year, too, the main objectives of Bonn policy are to 
create a secure living and future prospects for Germans in 
Central, East, and southeastern Europe by helping to develop 
settlement areas and granting admission, and to integrate late 
resettlers into Germany, Waffenschmidt said.
