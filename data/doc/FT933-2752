FT  17 SEP 93 / UN imposes sanctions on Angolan rebels
THE United Nations Security Council yesterday imposed an arms and oil
embargo on the Angolan rebel movement, Unita, for its refusal to abide by
the terms of a collapsed 1991 peace agreement.
But it delayed the application of the largely symbolic embargo for 10 days
to see if fresh peace talks can be convened in the meantime.
The council threatened further sanctions if civil war between Unita, led by
Dr Jonas Savimbi, and Angolan government forces has not ended by November 1.
These could include a trade ban and travel restrictions.
The interim measure is expected to have limited effect because Unita has
large stores of armaments and Angola produces oil in Cabinda. But the UN
action could deter countries like neighbouring Zaire from supporting Dr
Savimbi.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, estimates that more than
1,000 Angolans are dying daily in the war or from its effects - the largest
death toll in any current conflict.
Mr Venancio de Moura, the Angolan foreign minister, told the security
council that the situation in Cuito, which has been under siege for eight
months, was so desperate that people were eating human flesh to survive. He
accused Unita of 'horrendous massacres' and urged the council to impose
mandatory sanctions to force the rebels into negotiations.
Dr Savimbi submitted peace proposals last Monday that would establish a
ceasefire beginning in a week, but his forces continue to shell Cuito. They
are estimated to control all but one-fifth of the country.
The UN arranged and monitored elections last year which it hoped would
establish a popular government and end the carnage. But Dr Savimbi rejected
the outcome which gave victory to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos's MPLA
party, alleging widespread fraud.
