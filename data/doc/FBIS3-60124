  [Text] Alberto Lestelle, programming and coordination 
secretary for the prevention of drug abuse and for narcotics 
struggle, has admitted that Argentina is the drug "trafficking 
route" and that "drug money is laundered, although not in the 
same volume as in such places as Switzerland and the United 
States." 
  Lestelle said that "there is a lot of money behind drugs" 
and 
there are interests "in the political and journalistic 
structures, and in the security and justice organizations." 
  He added that following the death of Colombian trafficker 
and 
leader of the Medellin Cartel, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, it is 
possible that the drug mafias "will try to reorganize their 
cadres in the southern part of the continent," maybe in 
Brazil--"because of the political instability"--in Bolivia, and 
in Paraguay. 
  "Escobar's death was a spectacular victory for the Colombian 
government, but it is not the solution to the problem. The 
conflict may be intensified because the Medellin Cartel, 
besieged by the authorities and by the Cali Cartel, will try to 
reorganize itself," he added. 
  "Drug traffickers are everywhere, and except for the effort 
made by the governments of Argentina, Peru, and Colombia to 
eliminate them, they can operate because of the volume of money 
they handle," LA PRENSA reported in a note published today. 
  Lestelle said: "Relations between traffickers and guerrillas 
are not by chance because the former produces while the latter 
protects what the former produces, providing security--like in 
Peru or Colombia--in exchange for money." 
  Lestelle admitted that his organization "is not competent in 
fine intelligence work" and voiced his desire for the "creation 
of an organization to coordinate the intelligence organizations." 
  He concluded by saying: "The National Intelligence Center, 
to 
a certain extent, compensates for the absence of that 
organization although I am not aware of the success or failure 
of its performance because it is handled by the Secretariat for 
State Intelligence (SIDE)."
