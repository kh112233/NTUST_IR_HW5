EARNINGS 
ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.: The Costa Mesa-based drug maker said earnings fell 
46% to $3 million in the second quarter. Sales were up 9% to $44.5 million. ICN 
said the unfavorable quarter-to-quarter comparison in net income resulted from 
debt repurchases and gains in the company's investment portfolio in last year's 
second quarter, as well as substantially higher research and development 
spending by Viratek Inc. in this year's second quarter. It said both its 
pharmaceutical and biomedical operations registered solid gains in the quarter.
