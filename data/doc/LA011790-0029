BROWN'S CONCERN ON GAS TAX SPLIT EASES 
Emerging from a meeting with Gov. George Deukmejian and other legislative 
leaders, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said his concern that a gasoline tax 
proposal would be unfair to Northern Californians has been resolved. The San 
Francisco Democrat said Northern Californian will still get 33% to 37% of the 
gas tax revenue, or just a few percentage points less than the 40% it has been 
getting. 
Brown said a Metropolitan Transportation Commission report that Northern 
California could get as little as 27% is inaccurate, because it does not take 
into account related factors -- such as forgiveness of past overpayments to the 
north. The bipartisan proposal would raise the gas tax by 9 cents a gallon and 
would raise the state's constitutional spending limit. If voters approve the 
proposal in June, it would raise an estimated $18.5 billion over 10 years.
