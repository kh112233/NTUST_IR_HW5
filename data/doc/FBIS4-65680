  [Text] Bonn May 19 (CTK) -- By its "sharp rejection" of 
official dialogue with the Sudeten Germans and by "dubious 
attacks" on Austria and its Foreign Minister Alois Mock the 
Czech Republic is making a "mistake," Sudeten German 
Landsmannschaft (SL) Chairman Franz Neubauer said today in 
reaction to statements made by the leading Czech politicians. 
  He said that Prague's "sharp reaction" to his letter to the 
chairmen of the Czech coalition parties inviting them to start a 
dialogue and to attend the SL forthcoming congress in Nuremberg 
was incomprehensible. It clearly shows that the Sudeten German 
question is indeed open and urgently demands a solution, he said. 
  Neubauer recalled that in 1990 the Czechoslovak ambassador 
to 
Germany accepted a similar invitation to a SL meeting and a year 
later it was also accepted by a Czechoslovak parliamentary 
delegation. It was therefore incomprehensible to him why such 
an invitation should be a "provocation" this year. 
  Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, who was invited to come to 
Nuremberg by Neubauer, described the invitation as a 
"provocation." 
  At the close of his statement today Neubauer thanked Mock 
for 
clearly expressing his stance on the Sudeten German question and 
for not being reluctant to receive the SL's European Charles IV 
award. 
  Mock who is to be presented the award at the SL' weekend 
congress in Nuremberg, in the latest issue of the 
SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG magazine supported in a diplomatic way 
contacts between Sudeten Germans and the Czech side. He 
indirectly compared their postwar expulsion from Czechoslovakia 
to ethnic purges in the current Balkan war.
