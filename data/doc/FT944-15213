FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: US drugs companies advance
Merck and Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals companies, each reported
underlying double-digit sales growth for the three months to the end of
September, in spite of pressure on drug prices in the US and around the
world.
At Merck, sales of human and animal health products grew by 11 per cent.
This was in spite of the effect of lower prices, mainly in non-US markets,
which shaved two percentage points off sales growth.
As with Lilly, foreign exchange differences added one percentage point to
sales growth in the period.
Merck's overall sales of Dollars 3.8bn were up from Dollars 2.5bn a year
ago, due to its acquisition of Medco Containment Services, the pharmacy
benefit management company, at the end of last year.
Medco's lower profit margins mean that net income from a year ago was up
only 11 per cent, at Dollars 785m, while earnings per share were flat at 62
cents.
Merck did not provide a detailed break-down of sales of its various drugs,
but said the advance had been led by a range of its newer products.
Eli Lilly, meanwhile, reported a 25 per cent jump in pharmaceutical sales
compared with a year before, primarily due to the success of Prozac, its
market-leading anti-depressant.
The high sales of Prozac were based in part on a build-up in inventories by
wholesalers before a price rise, Lilly said.
The company is currently locked in discussions with US regulators over its
own planned acquisition of a pharmacy benefit management company, PCS.
Overall sales growth in the US came in spite of pressure on prices from
managed-card organisations and higher rebates manufacturers are being forced
to pass on to Medicaid, the government-run healthcare scheme for the poor,
Lilly said.
Net income reached Dollars 318m on sales of Dollars 1.82bn, compared with
Dollars 294.4m on sales of Dollars 1.53bn a year before. Earnings per share
were Dollars 1.10, up from Dollars 1.00.
