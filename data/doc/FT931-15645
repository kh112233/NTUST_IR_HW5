FT  12 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs hear of heavy sales to Iraq
BRITAIN sold more machine tools to Iraq between 1987 and 1989 than
manufacturers in the US, Italy and France put together, Mr John Major told
MPs last night.
In a written answer to a question originally tabled on November 24 by Mr
Phillip Oppenheim, Tory MP for Amber Valley, Mr Major indicated that British
machine tool sales to Saddam Hussein's regime totalled nearly Dollars 93m
over the period in question.
That compared with Dollars 42m-worth of equipment sold by Italy, Dollars
16.8m by France and Dollars 11.7m by the US. British sales peaked at more
than Dollars 63m in 1988, the year a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war was
agreed.
When called upon in the past to defend sales of possible dual-use equipment
such as machine tools, government officials have argued that if Britain did
not agree to export the goods, other countries would.
The government appointed Lord Justice Scott to head an independent judicial
inquiry into arms sales to Iraq in the wake of the Matrix Churchill affair.
