SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 FDA provides research contracts to the NAS/IOM to support the preparation of the Food Chemicals Codex, a compendium
of specifications for substances used as food ingredients. Before the inclusion of any specifications in a Food Chemicals
Codex publication, public announcement will be made in the 

Federal Register

. All interested parties are invited to comment and to make suggestions for consideration. Suggestions should be
accompanied by supporting data or documentation to facilitate and expedite review by the Committee on Food Chemicals
Codex.



In the 

Federal Registers

 of January 11, 1991 (56 FR 1198), and April 9, 1991 (56 FR 14382), FDA announced that the NAS/IOM Committee on Food Chemicals
Codex was considering new monographs and monograph revisions for inclusion in the third supplement to the Food Chemicals
Codex, third edition, which has since been published. In the 

Federal Register

 of November 22, 1991 (56 FR 58910), FDA announced that the NAS/IOM Committee on Food Chemicals Codex was considering
new monographs and monograph revisions for inclusion in the fourth supplement to the Food Chemicals Codex, third
edition, which also has been published. Both supplements are available from the National Academy Press at the address
given above for NAS. 
FDA now gives notice that the NAS/IOM Committee on Food Chemicals Codex is soliciting comments and information on
proposed new monographs and proposed changes to certain current monographs. These new monographs and changes will
be published in the fourth edition of the Food Chemicals Codex. Copies of the proposed new monographs and revisions
to current monographs may be obtained from NAS at the address listed above.
FDA emphasizes, however, that it will not consider adopting new monographs and monograph revisions until the public
has had ample opportunity to comment on the changes and the new monographs. Such opportunity for public comment will
be announced in a subsequent notice published in the 

Federal Register.
The NAS/IOM Committee on Food Chemicals Codex invites comments and suggestions of specifications by all interested
parties on the proposed new monographs and revisions of current monographs, which follow:

 notice. NAS will forward a copy of each comment to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA305), Food and Drug Administration,
