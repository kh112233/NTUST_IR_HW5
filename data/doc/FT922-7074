FT  20 MAY 92 / Boulogne freight link
THE Folkestone-Boulogne cross-Channel ferry route, closed by Sealink Stena
Line at the end of last year, is to be reopened to freight traffic in mid
June by a new shipping company, Opale Ferries.
The company, formed by a group of mainly French investors led by the
Boulogne Chamber of Commerce, has chartered a Canadian freight ferry with
capacity for 50 lorries.
Opale believes there is enough demand among long-established users of
Boulogne to justify the service in spite of competition from the Channel
tunnel.
Passenger services were restored to the route last month through
Hoverspeed's SeaCat catamaran service.
North Sea Ferries has ordered two Pounds 31m freight ferries for its
Hull-Rotterdam route. Associated British Ports, which owns the port of Hull,
is to build an Pounds 11m roll-on roll-off terminal to serve them.
