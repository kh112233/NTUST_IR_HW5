METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
SLUMLORD FINED, GETS 45-DAY JAIL SENTENCE 
A convicted slumlord was given $18,700 in fines Thursday and ordered to begin 
serving a 45-day County Jail term next month. 
William H. Burkhalter, 56, of Los Angeles was also placed on three years' 
informal probation by Municipal Judge Suzanne Person and was ordered to perform 
1,000 hours of community service. 
Burkhalter was convicted in February, 1987, of violating fire, building and 
safety and health codes at a four-story, 63-unit apartment building he owned at 
1723 W. 9th St. 
Burkhalter, who no longer owns the building, was originally sentenced last 
March. He appealed the sentence, contending it was excessive. The Los Angeles 
Superior Court rejected the appeal in November.
