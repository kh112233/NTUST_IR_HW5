 

&bull;For the length of the project, provide selected school districts and organizations with quarterly ADA information

&bull;Coordinate training activities with the regional offices of OCR/ED. 


Proposed Priority 4: ADA Training for State and Local ADA Coordinators and Policymakers 


Background 

Governors, mayors, city managers, city planners, county boards, agency directors, and other State and local government
officials bear responsibility for ensuring compliance with Title II of the ADA. In addition 35.107 of the ADA
regulations (28 CFR part 35) requires that a public entity that employs 50 or more persons shall designate at least
one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with the ADA, including investigation of any complaint alleging
its noncompliance or alleging any prohibited actions. Such persons are frequently identified as ``ADA Coordinators''
by State or local governments. According to the most recent (1987) report of the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately
7,665 counties, municipalities, and townships that have 50 or more full-time employees. 
Title II requires public entities to evaluate their current services, policies, and practices to identify and correct
any that are not consistent with the requirements of Title II. State and local ADA Coordinators and government policymakers
are responsible for ensuring that the self-evaluations are carried out. To ensure that these self-evaluations are
appropriately carried out and the necessary changes made, State and local ADA Coordinators and government policymakers
need information and training about the requirements of the ADA and policy developments in the field. 


Proposed Priority 

An ADA training project for State and local ADA coordinators and policymakers shall_

&bull;Identify and select for direct training State and local ADA coordinators and government policymakers from
every Federal Region of the country, including those from urban, rural, and suburban areas, and ensuring the broad
representation of local governments where a majority of the citizens are from minority backgrounds; 
&bull;Identify and select for training organizations whose members are policymakers in State and local government
with responsibilities for complying with the ADA; 
&bull;Develop a strategy and a schedule for directly training State and local ADA coordinators and policymakers
as well as the membership and staff of selected organizations using a variety of approaches including, but not limited
to, on-site training, regional, State, and local meetings, teleconferences, and audioconferences; 
&bull;Utilizing existing federally-approved materials to the maximum extent appropriate, develop an array of
training materials and activities that vary in length and content in order to accommodate the information and scheduling
needs of selected coordinators and organizations; 
&bull;Provide training to selected State and local ADA coordinators, policymakers and members of organizations
on the responsibilities of State and local governments under Title II of the ADA and in order to assist State and local
governments to undertake their self-evaluation plans and make the changes needed to comply with the ADA; 
&bull;To the maximum extent possible, utilize as trainers those individuals with disabilities who have been trained
as trainers by a NIDRR, EEOC, or DOJ technical assistance or training project; 
&bull;For the length of the project provide selected coordinators, policymakers and organizations with quarterly
ADA information updates, before and after training, regarding legal and policy developments. 


Proposed Priority 5: ADA Training for Hispanics With Rights and Duties Under the ADA Whose Proficiency in English
Is Limited 


Background 

The Hispanic population in the U.S. totals approximately 22 million people, or 9.0 percent of the population. By the
year 2010, the Hispanic population is expected to become the second-largest racial/ethnic group (National Council
of La Raza Census Information Center, Hispanic Population Factsheet, November 1993).
