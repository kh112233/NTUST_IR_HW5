<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On October 23, 1992, the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (WBCA) was signed into law, the purposes of which include
promoting the conservation of exotic birds by: ensuring that all imports into the United States of species of exotic
birds are biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject
to inhumane treatment during capture and transport; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs
in countries of origin. This proposed rule would implement procedures for approval of foreign captive-breeding
facilities and establishment of an approved list of species listed in the Appendices to the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora that can be imported. 


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) will consider comments and information received by April 16,1994 in formulating
a final rule, except for subpart D, 15.32, for which the Service will consider comments and information received
by June 15, 1994 in formulating a final rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This rule proposes regulations implementing aspects of the WBCA, which was signed into law on October 23, 1992. This
is the second of two notices of proposed rulemaking under the WBCA; the first was published in the 

Federal Register

 on August 12, 1993 (58 FR 42926). The first final rulemaking under the WBCA was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 16, 1993 (58 FR 60524). The WBCA limits or prohibits imports of exotic bird species to ensure that their
wild populations are not harmed by trade. It also encourages wild bird conservation programs in countries of origin
by both ensuring that all trade in such species involving the United States is biologically sustainable and is not
detrimental to the species, and by creating an Exotic Bird Conservation Fund to provide conservation assistance
in countries of origin. The final rule of November 16, 1993, summarized the effects of the WBCA and proposed procedures
for obtaining import permits authorized by exemptions in the WBCA. 


An immediate moratorium, effective October 23, 1992, was established on the importation of ten species of wild birds
of particular concern that are listed in appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES, or Convention), two of which were moved to appendix I at the March 1992 CITES meeting.
The prohibition on importation of those species was announced in the 

Federal Register

 of December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57510). 
During the one-year delay period from October 23, 1992, to October 22, 1993, there was an import quota on CITES-listed
bird species. That quota was announced in the 

Federal Register

 of December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57510). A notice published on March 30, 1993 (58 FR 16644), solicited public comments and
announced a public meeting, held April 1516, 1993, to receive input from the public in the development of regulations
to implement some of the provisions of the WBCA. Useful input was received from a broad cross-section of interested
members of the public who participated in the meeting and submitted comments in writing; that input has been utilized
in developing this proposed rule. A notice published on April 16, 1993 (58 FR 19840) announced species for which the
quota had been met and no further individual birds could be imported.
