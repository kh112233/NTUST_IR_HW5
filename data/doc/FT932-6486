FT  28 MAY 93 / Parents opposed to school testing
PARENT-TEACHER asso-ciations are overwhelmingly opposed to this year's
national curriculum tests in England and Wales, says a ballot announced
today, John Authers writes.
The poll, by the Electoral Reform Society for the National Confederation of
Parent Teacher Associations, found 76.2 per cent of primary school parents
opposed tests for seven-year-olds, and 78.4 per cent of secondary school
parents were against tests for 14-year-olds.
The results contradict a telephone poll of 1,000 parents for the Department
for Education, showing 37 per cent opposition.
Ms Margaret Morrissey, of the NCPTA, called again for the tests to be made
voluntary, adding parents were entitled to remove their children from tests.
Ballot forms were sent to the NCPTA's 9,504 members on May 14, after the
statement by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, that they would be
simplified for next year.
