ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 
PART-TIME WORKERS' HOURS TO BE PARED 
Some part-time municipal workers will soon see their hours cut because of a 
longstanding agreement between the city and the state retirement fund that 
limits the number of hours for such workers. 
Beginning July 1, employees classified as part time will not be allowed to 
exceed 19.5 hours per week, or 1,000 hours annually. 
"This has been a policy of the city for several years, but only recently it 
came to our attention that part-timers had been working in excess of that," 
City Manager Allan L. Roeder said. 
Roeder has instructed city departments to scale back their part-time workers' 
hours so they don't exceed the limit before the end of the current fiscal year. 
The move will affect about 55 workers, mostly in recreation services and park 
and golf course maintenance, Personnel Director Steve Hayman said. The city 
employs an average of 212 part-time employees a year, Hayman said. 
A part-time worker at the Costa Mesa Golf Course said he will have to find 
another job to make up for the lost hours. Although part-time employees there 
are normally scheduled for three six-hour shifts a week, they also fill in when 
other workers are sick or on vacation. 
"It's been good," said the worker, who declined to give his name. "Most of the 
people here are either in junior college or senior citizens, so the extra hours 
help." 
When the new fiscal year begins July 1, the payroll system will automatically 
alert the part-time workers and their supervisors when the limit is 
approaching, Hayman said. 
The rule is the result of a contractual agreement with the state Public 
Employees Retirement System, which stipulates that both employer and employee 
must contribute to the employee's retirement fund after the employee has worked 
1,000 hours in a year, Roeder said. MARY ANNE PEREZ
