Democratic Alliance Supporters Are Former Civic Democratic Party 
Voters"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Civic Democratic Alliance and the Czech 
Social Democratic Party [CSSD] have gained the most new 
supporters since the last elections, in 1992. While 5.2 percent 
of citizens voted for the Alliance then, it now enjoys the 
support of 12.7 percent of respondents, according to a poll 
conducted by the Center for Empirical Research. Seven percent of 
the electorate cast their votes for the social democrats in the 
elections; however, 15.7 percent of citizens would vote for them 
now. 
  The Alliance gained most of its current supporters--37 
percent--from among former Civic Democratic Party [ODS] voters. 
Another 13 percent have transferred from the Free Democrats 
(Civic Movement [OH]), the Liberal Social Union, the Christian 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, the CSSD, and the 
Association for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia. 
  Seventeen percent of those who would support the social 
democrats in new elections voted for the ODS last time; 15 
percent voted for the Left Bloc. Some former OH and Movement 
for Self-Governing Democracy-Society for Moravia and Silesia 
voters have now decided to vote for Zeman's party.
