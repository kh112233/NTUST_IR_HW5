 

Polio Vaccine What you Need To Know Before Your 
Child Gets the Vaccine 



What Is Polio? 



Polio is a serious disease that can cause life-long paralysis 
(that is, victims cannot move parts of their bodies). Some polio 
victims cannot breathe without the help of a machine. They may 
even die. Your child can be protected from polio by the 
vaccine. Polio is very rare in our country, mostly because 
people are protected by polio vaccine. 

There are 2 kinds of polio vaccine: 


OPV or Oral Polio Vaccine. OPV is given by mouth as drops. 
Most experts recommend OPV for healthy children. 

IPV or Inactivated Polio Vaccine. IPV is a shot. 



Should Everyone Get the Polio Vaccine? 



Experts believe that almost all young children should get polio 
vaccine. To help your doctor/nurse know what is best for your 
child, please answer the following questions. 




<TABLE>





1 
1Yes 
1No





1. Is the person getting the vaccine 
or anyone else in the home 
less able to fight infections because of: 



A disease such as cancer or leukemia? 
} 
} 

Special cancer treatments such 
as x-rays or drugs? 
} 
} 

Drugs such as prednisone or 
other steroids? 
} 
} 

An inborn or inherited disease? 
} 
} 

AIDS or HIV infection? 
} 
} 




If the answer to any of these questions is ``yes,'' 
your doctor/nurse will probably give IPV instead of OPV 




2. Is the person getting the vaccine pregnant 
or think she is? 
} 
} 




If so, she can come back for the vaccine when she is not 
pregnant. If she needs to be protected against polio right 
away, she may get OPV or IPV 




3. Does the person getting the vaccine have 
a serious allergy to neomycin, streptomycin, 
or polymyxin B (antibiotics)? 
} 
} 



If so, he or she can get OPV, but not IPV

 


4. Does the person getting the vaccine have 
frequent close contact with anyone 
who never got the polio vaccine? 
} 
} 

</TABLE>



If so, the person who never got the polio vaccine should 
talk to her/his doctor/nurse about getting IPV. 



When Should Your Child Get the Polio Vaccine? 



Most children should have a total of 4 polio vaccines. They 
should get vaccine at: 





2 months of age
4 months of age
 6 to 18 months of age
 4 to 6 years of age 




These vaccines may be given at the same time as other childhood 
vaccines. 

Before travel to countries where polio still occurs, adults and 
children should get at least 1 more dose of either OPV (if they 
had OPV before) or IPV. Your doctor/nurse can tell you how many 
doses are needed. 



Are There Risks With Polio Vaccine? 



The polio vaccine is the best way to protect your child against 
this serious disease. But there are risks with any medicine, 
including vaccines. There is a very small chance that serious 
problems, even death, could occur after getting vaccines. The 
risk from the vaccine is much smaller than the risk from the 
disease.
