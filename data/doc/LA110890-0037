METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN RUNS INTO PATH OF BLUE LINE, IS KILLED 
A Blue Line train struck and killed a man at Vernon and Long Beach avenues in 
South-Central Los Angeles on Wednesday shortly after 8 p.m., just two blocks 
south of where a woman and her 4-year-old son were killed two weeks ago. 
Witnesses said the man, whose identity was not released, had asked them when 
the next train was coming. 
When he heard the train's horn, he ran around a crossing gate and into its 
path, they said. 
The woman and her son were killed Oct. 24 when she drove her car around a 
lowered crossing gate at 41st Street near Long Beach Avenue and into the path 
of a train. 
This marked the fourth Blue Line-related death since the passenger train 
service began in mid-July.
