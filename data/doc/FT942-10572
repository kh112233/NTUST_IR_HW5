FT  10 MAY 94 / Observer: Beastly fortune
What's the connection between Pope John Paul II's broken hip and the
governor of Hawaii's broken date?
No joke this, but high-level diplomacy. It turns out Hawaii's governor was
due to attend a beatification ceremony in Rome on May 12 of the Belgian
priest, Damien de Veuster, who established Hawaii's leper colony on the
island of Molokai in 1873.
But now the pontiff has mobility problems he has cancelled the ceremony,
costing some London hacks a promising lunch at the Hawaii Visitors Bureau in
London. The governor had hoped to brief them on his domain, but decided to
abort his mission after the Pope cried off.
