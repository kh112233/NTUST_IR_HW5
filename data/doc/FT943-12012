FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Nabisco rises 35% despite fall
in US sales
RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and foods group, shrugged off an 11 per cent
decline in domestic cigarette sales to post a 35 per cent increase in
second-quarter profits to Dollars 192m, before extraordinary items.
After accounting for a Dollars 146m one-off charge related to the repurchase
and retirement of debt, RJR's net income in the quarter totalled Dollars
46m. In the same quarter a year ago, after a Dollars 65m charge for debt
repurchase and retirement, the group earned net income of Dollars 77m.
Excluding extraordinary items, RJR's first-half profits rose to Dollars
386m, up from a comparable Dollars 352m a year earlier.
The company said improved domestic tobacco margins, rising international
cigarette sales, and a strong performance from its worldwide food businesses
were behind the advance during the quarter.
It was the first reporting period not affected by last year's so-called
Marlboro Friday, when Philip Morris prompted a price war among cigarette
makers by cutting the price of its premium brands.
Operating income during the three months was Dollars 675m on sales of
Dollars 3.78bn, up from Dollars 582m a year earlier on sales of Dollars
3.72bn. Amid continued aggressive expansion overseas, most notably in former
Soviet bloc countries, RJR's international tobacco business again performed
strongly. However, foreign exchange losses - said by analysts to total
Dollars 28m - took their toll.
The group's Nabisco foods business reported a 20 per cent increase in
operating earnings, with domestic biscuit sales again posting impressive
growth.
RJR's results were in line with analysts' forecasts, but their failure to
match the better-than-expected second-quarter earnings of rivals Philip
Morris and American Brands disappointed some investors, who bid the group's
stock down Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 in New York.
