CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SAN FRANCISCO; 
VOTERS EVENLY SPLIT ON HIKE IN GAS TAX 
Voter opinion on Proposition 111, the state measure that would raise gasoline 
taxes for road improvements and transit systems, is now evenly divided, 
according to the latest California Poll. 
The poll results, released this week, found that 46% of the 1,007 voters 
questioned earlier this month were in favor of the measure and 46% were against 
it. Proposition 111 will be on the June ballot. Soon after the Oct. 17 Bay Area 
earthquake, the proposition was favored 55% to 45% in a California Poll.
