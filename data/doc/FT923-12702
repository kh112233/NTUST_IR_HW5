FT  17 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent weakens on discount
rate rise
THE BUNDESBANK's 0.75 point rise in the discount rate was a quarter- point
more than expected, hardening one of the softer options available to the
German central bank which yesterday repeated its concern about German
monetary growth, and the accompanying inflation threat.
The move came in the early afternoon, and most bourses responded by marking
share prices down, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT closed higher ahead of the Buba decision, the DAX index rising
5.91 to 1,740.53, but an hour later most blue chips were showing losses of
0.5 to 1 per cent since the end of the session.
Earlier, short-covering and a rally in car stocks underpinned the market, as
volume rose from DM3.9bn to DM4.1bn. Among car stocks, recovering from fears
of higher German petrol taxes, BMW jumped DM9.50 to DM579, and Volkswagen by
DM5 to DM380.70. After-hours losses were DM4, and DM3.20 respectively.
Other notable movers were the steel group, Thyssen, up DM3.90 at DM233.50,
and the retailer, Ava, down a net DM28 at DM625. Thyssen rose on Germany's
planned DM170bn transport revolution, and hopes that construction of the
Transrapid magnetic train system would finally start soon.
Ava fell as it went ex-dividend. There was talk that Ava's relationship with
its biggest shareholder, Asko, and cautious prospects at its biggest
competitor in food hypermarkets, Allkauf, were also behind the drop.
PARIS reflected volatility in the bond market which promptly fell after the
Bundesbank raised its discount rate but then immediately bounced back to
earlier levels. The CAC 40 index went as low as 1,844.95 and as high as
1,869.23 before closing 2.03 lower at 1,851.23 in moderate turnover of
FFr1.87bn.
Total was the day's most active stock, adding FFr6 or 2.5 per cent to
FFr245.
Michelin was also firmer, adding FFr6.20 or 3 per cent to FFr213.70. Dealers
said the stock rose following the pleasing second quarter results from
BFGoodrich, one of Michelin's competitors in the US. BFGoodrich said it
expected growing demand for its products, which include aircraft tyres.
MILAN started the new account on a weak note as many stocks, including Fiat
and Generali, went ex dividend. But a firm official closing by Generali
lifted the market later. By midday, however, volume dried up as dealers
closed their positions ahead of the Bundesbank's news conference. The market
was closed by the time the Bank of Italy announced that it was raising
interest rates, but Italian shares traded in London fell. The Comit index
rose 1.23 to 446.65 in turnover estimated at less than Wednesday's L127bn.
Fiat dropped a net L11 to L4,970 while Generali rose a net L548.36 to
L28,250 and hit L28,500 after hours. But both stocks came off in the
afternoon in London, with the car company being quoted at L4,930/4960 and
the insurer at L27,900/28,100.
AMSTERDAM weakened after the German announcement. The CBS Tendency index
closed down 0.5 at 121.3, having earlier seen 122.6.
In the market, activity was generally negative with the exception of ABN
Amro up 60 cents at Fl 45.60, CSM up Fl 1.80 at Fl 93.30 on Wednesday's news
that it is to acquire a US bakery group and Heineken reaching an all-time
high of Fl 173.70, up Fl 1.20.
Elsewhere Elsevier remained under selling pressure, losing Fl 1.90 to Fl
105.80 while Borsumij put on Fl 1 to Fl 58 after announcing the purchase of
a unit of Van Ommeren, 30 cents weaker at Fl 37.40.
ZURICH turned negative after the Bundesbank move, and then recovered half of
its losses, having moved in a relatively wide trading range. The SMI index
of leading shares closed 5.7 lower at 1,838.7, 16 points below its high for
the day but 16 points, too, above its low.
There was weakness in banks, with CS Holdings, SBC and UBS all down by a
little under a percentage point. Banks had been looking for further declines
in short-term interest rates and, at least on the day, this had come into
question.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer of Swiss Volksbank, however, said that markets had
not yet come to terms with the threat of further weakness in the dollar,
could pose a problem to Nestle, and other big dollar earners like the Swiss
pharmaceutical groups.
MADRID had a hectic day with the general index closing 2.19 lower at 228.88
in moderate volume of Pta11.5bn. Construction stocks went against the trend
in a technical rebound after several days of steep declines.
Telefonica weakened Pta10 to Pta1,070 with a heavy 1.6m shares traded.
