Without Number"] 
  [Text] The discovery and arrest of a high-ranking employee 
of one of the Moscow agencies of the Russian defense complex 
recruited last year by the British intelligence service once 
more confirms that active work by Western special services 
against Russia is being done. 
  Commenting on this case, Aleksandr Mikhaylov, head of the 
Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] public relations 
center, has stated in a KURANTY interview that when foreign 
special services are acting in Russia in an extremely brazen and 
pushy manner, it is very important for our law and order organs 
not to relax, and put the adversary in his place. He underlined 
that the FCS would resolutely cut short such anti-Russia 
activity. "When we are given the possibility to do our 
professional business, concrete results have appeared." In 
1993, 20 citizens of Russia were indicted for high treason in 
the form of spying, including Baranov, a Main Intelligence 
Directorate officer, who was sentenced to six years imprisonment. 
  Asked if he could give the agent's name, Mikhaylov said it 
was not known to him; however, he revealed the nature of his 
work. The English agent was in particular in charge of 
financing the Russian "defense industry" [oboronka] and his 
organization's export activities, and the military-industrial 
complex's high-tech programs. According to the FCS spokesman, 
this disclosure is in no way connected with the Ames case. 
  [Sedykh] Would this be further followed up by an expulsion 
from the country of an English spy? 
  [Mikhaylov] This decision will be made by the top political 
leadership. Quite possibly, a rather high-ranking member of 
Great Britain's embassy in Moscow will have to leave Russia.
