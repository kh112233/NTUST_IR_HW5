FT  29 JUN 92 / Building Contracts: Pounds 50m distribution centre
KYLE STEWART PROPER TIES has been appointed by Doncaster Metropolitan
Borough Council to develop and construct an intermodal link, worth Pounds
50m, to Europe via the Channel Tunnel.
The 'Direct For Europe' intermodal road/rail distribution centre is believed
to be the first of its type in the UK and is now available for users as a
base to manufacture and distribute to the Continent.
"Direct for Europe' will stand on 26 hectares of local authority-owned land
alongside the Doncaster M18 link road and adjacent to British Rail's
electrified East Coast main line and European Train Operating Centre (where
trains will be assembled for routing through the Channel Tunnel to
destinations in continental Europe).
Sidings will connect directly off the main line to service the complex of
new manufacturing and distribution centres.
