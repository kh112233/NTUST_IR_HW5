DEATHS OF 4 SEA OTTERS LEAD TO TIGHTER CURBS ON GILL NETS 
State fish and game officials say they will further restrict the use of gill 
nets in a small area of the Central Coast waters after the weekend deaths of 
four sea otters. 
The sea otters -- classified a "threatened" species -- were entangled and 
killed in a fine-filament gill net near Monterey. 
Al Petrovich, chief of the Fish and Game Department's marine resources 
division, said he was informed that a state-paid ocean observer -- looking 
through a land-based telescope -- saw a fisherman take the four dead otters 
from his gill net off Ragged Point. The number of dead otters reported was 
unusually high for one net and brought documented deaths of the threatened 
marine mammal to six this year. 
"We've had them trickle in periodically, one here and one there," Petrovich 
said about dead otter reports. "But not four." 
Petrovich said the state is now drafting an emergency measure that would allow 
commercial boats in the Ragged Point area to use their gill nets only in water 
180 feet or deeper. Existing regulations permit gill nets in water as shallow 
as 120 feet. Petrovich said the boats use gill nets on the Central Coast to 
catch halibut, which bring fishermen as much as $2.25 a pound. 
The use of gill nets in California coastal waters is a simmering controversy, 
which has pitted commercial fishermen against environmentalists and 
recreational fishermen. Operators of commercial boats say the nets are 
efficient, but the environmentalists say the fine-filament mesh 
indiscriminately kills endangered marine mammals such as porpoises and otters. 
Environmentalists and game fishermen are currently gathering signatures to 
place a measure on the November ballot to ban the use of gill nets in the 
coastal waters of Southern California.
