<F P=106> [Interview with Horst Eylmann, German CDU justice expert, by </F>
Andrea Tarquini in Bonn; date not given: "Instant Trials for 
Nazis"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- President von Weizsaecker's appeal and 
the new laws promised by Chancellor Kohl will not remain just 
words: Germany is taking action against neo-Nazis. One of those 
responsible for hunting foreigners in Magdeburg was slapped with 
an arrest warrant and other, similar provisions are being 
examined. The severe criticism leveled by the head of state and 
the chancellor encouraged dozens of citizens from the ancient 
city in eastern Germany to come forward and testify, thus making 
it possible to identify the neo-Nazis. The publication of laws 
which increase sentences for xenophobic violence is imminent: 
On Wednesday [18 May], the extraordinary meeting of the Justice 
Commission will conclude its work, and on Friday this work is to 
be examined in the Bundestag. 
  While Chancellor Kohl's party yesterday confirmed that 
it "severely" condemns Nazi violence, we talked to Horst 
Eylmann, a prominent member of the CDU [Christian Democratic 
Union] and chairman of the Justice Commission. He is the father 
of the package of laws aimed at stopping fascist subversion. 
  [Tarquini] Mr. Eylmann, what are the priorities in the 
struggle against the neo-Nazis? 
  [Eylmann] It is of the utmost importance that we punish 
xenophobic violence by the extreme Right with the greatest 
speed. Effective deterrents are needed. All too often, the 
trial procedure is slow. The guarantees provided by the law 
cannot be extended to such a point that they become an advantage 
for the enemies of that state. We want to toughen up the 
sentences for injury from three to five years, lengthen custody 
for those caught in the act up to a week, and make it possible 
to hold summary trials. 
  [Tarquini] Do you think that your proposals will be passed? 
  [Eylmann] There is a good chance that the Bundestag will 
approve them in its plenary session on Friday. 
  [Tarquini] How important is the struggle against extreme 
right-wingers? 
  [Eylmann] The state must do its duty. We have not forgotten 
the memories which any act of Nazi violence evokes among our 
neighbors. Preventing a repetition of Magdeburg is also of 
crucial importance for our image in the world. However, the 
state intervenes when the crimes have already been committed. 
Schools, too, must do more to explain to young people what the 
ideas of the radical right have brought to our country and to 
the world. We have underestimated the sway which these 
ideologies can hold in society, seducing ignorant and 
marginalized young people who are suspicious of the state: both 
here and in other countries. 
  [Tarquini] Would the entry of a postfascist or neofascist 
party into the majority in Italy encourage the extreme Right in 
Europe? 
  [Eylmann] I do not know if your neofascists can be compared 
to our violent ultrafascists. You can judge that better than I. 
Of course, I would not rule out the Republikaner taking 
advantage of the events in Italy during their election campaign. 
They will say that if that happened in your country then it can 
happen in Germany. However, they would be a mistake: I do not 
think that they will get into parliament. 
  [Tarquini] Why not? 
  [Eylmann] Because neo-Nazi violence distances voters from 
them, and because no German party is, or ever will be, prepared 
to be part of a coalition with the radical Right. They will not 
enter the inner sanctum of politics. 
  [Tarquini] How much influence will the fight against 
neo-Nazis have in the election campaign? 
  [Eylmann] It will have an influence, of course, but I think 
that the parties would be well advised not to exchange 
accusations on this matter. Rather they should stand together 
in rejecting the ideas of the extreme right. The required 
consensus already exists among the democratic parties. 
  [Tarquini] How do you explain this difference between 
Germany 
and the European countries where the Right is entering the inner 
sanctum of politics? 
  [Eylmann] We are still living with the trauma of the 
suffering which Nazism inflicted on the world and which made us 
suffer, too. Here in Germany, all it took was a film like 
"Schindler's List" to revive the shock and to make many young 
people understand what really happened. It provoked a 
collective emotional response from those who try to play down 
and forget the past. 
  [Tarquini] [Italian National Alliance leader] Fini called 
Mussolini the greatest statesman of the century. What do you 
say about that? 
  [Eylmann] That is an irresponsible view.
