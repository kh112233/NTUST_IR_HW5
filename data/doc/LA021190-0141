72% FEWER HOMELESS USE NEW SHELTER; 
FAMILIES: THE VALLEY'S COLD-WEATHER SHELTER PROGRAM USES AN AUSTERE ARMORY. THE 
PROGRAM HAD OFFERED MOTEL ROOMS. 
Despite 38 nights of bitter-cold temperatures in the San Fernando Valley this 
winter, only a handful of homeless families have sought refuge in a new 
city-sponsored shelter in Sylmar, drawing criticism from some homeless 
advocates who say the program is ineffective. 
On two frigid nights this month no one showed up. On average, about eight 
mothers, fathers and children sleep on cots in the sprawling gymnasium-size 
Sylmar National Guard Armory each night. 
The nearly empty armory represents a 72% decrease in the number of homeless 
served this winter and results from a major cost-cutting change in the 
emergency cold-weather shelter program in the San Fernando Valley. 
Last year homeless families were given a free motel room when night 
temperatures dropped to 40 degrees. The program attracted hundreds each night. 
This year the city opened the doors to an austere armory, which has proved to 
be a far less desirable alternative for families. 
Between Nov. 1, 1988, and Feb. 5, 1989, 10,298 people were housed -- mainly in 
motels -- on 42 nights. During the same period a year later, 2,887 were housed 
on 38 nights in two shelters. The Sylmar family shelter has housed only 308 
parents and children. Another armory shelter exclusively for adults in Van Nuys 
has attracted an average of about 65 each night it has been open. 
"The bottom line is that the family shelter program isn't working and is not 
effective," said John Suggs of the Los Angeles Countywide Coalition for the 
Homeless. "This is not an indication that the homeless population is 
decreasing. It's a clear indication that the program is not addressing the 
basic needs of the homeless population." 
Gov. George Deukmejian allowed municipalities to use the state's armories as 
shelters for the first time last year after four people died of hypothermia in 
Los Angeles. Before that, the city opened park recreation centers to the 
homeless. 
Last year families -- especially single mothers with young children -- were 
offered vouchers for motel rooms because officials did not believe it was 
appropriate to house mothers and children in the same facility with adults, 
many of whom often suffer from mental illness. In addition, boisterous children 
often angered adults. 
City officials and some who work with the homeless say the change was needed to 
improve flaws in the previous program. The motel voucher program was open to 
abuse because it was difficult to prove if a family was truly homeless or 
simply taking advantage of a free night in a motel. Also, social service 
workers were not able to offer food and counseling to families who 
"disappeared" into motel rooms. 
Capt. John Purdell of the Van Nuys Corps of the Salvation Army was critical of 
the motel program because families were often sent to neighborhoods plagued 
with drug trafficking and prostitution. He said he believes many families 
reject the armory operation because of strict rules that prohibit drinking and 
smoking. 
"The city is providing a clean, supervised shelter, and many homeless I'm sure 
are saying 'thanks but no thanks,' " Purdell said. "I don't mean to sound 
uncaring. But many homeless cannot cope with such regulations." 
Homeless advocates and city officials both cite several reasons why the shelter 
program is failing to attract homeless families: 
* The armory is difficult to find, hidden from street view by industrial 
buildings in an eastern corner of Sylmar. 
* Homeless parents are afraid to bring their children to a government-sponsored 
shelter, fearful that authorities will take their children away. 
* Families are forced to leave the armory between 6 and 6:30 a.m. 
* The shelter program operates sporadically, depending on strict temperature 
guidelines. This makes it difficult for a family to know when it will be cold 
enough to open. 
One homeless couple with five young children who stayed in the shelter Tuesday 
said they were thankful for the warm room at night, but were jarred awake and 
sent out in the dawn cold with nowhere to go. 
"They woke us up at 5:30 and told us we had to pack our bags and leave," said 
James Enriquez, 26. "It's real hard. Where are you supposed to go with five 
kids and no money at that hour? It's still cold out there." 
Toni Reines, co-director of the California Homeless Coalition, said the 
armories do not provide a setting that works for most families. 
"They don't know when the program will be open. They have to be back out in the 
cold at 6 a.m. with their kids," Reines said. "It's obvious that it is not as 
desirable as being in a private motel room. People would rather sleep in their 
cars." 
Los Angeles emergency shelter policy mandates that the city open shelters for 
the homeless when the temperature drops to 40 degrees or less at night and to 
50 degrees or less when rain is forecast. 
The Valley, shielded from warm ocean wind by the Santa Monica Mountains, has 
been hit with freezing or near-freezing temperatures 38 nights this winter. The 
rest of the city, which has recorded temperatures of 40 degrees or lower on 
only nine nights -- is served by a second family shelter, in Venice. 
Although criticized by some homeless advocates as an arbitrary cutoff, city 
officials defend the 40-degree requirement. 
"If we don't have a standard then it becomes a subjective thing on when we 
activate the shelters," said Karen Patterson of the Community Development 
Department. 
Nonetheless, city officials say, they are concerned with the low attendance at 
the Sylmar armory. But because the program ends March 31, they are unlikely to 
change the program this late in the season. 
"Obviously, we need to think of a program that works better. That's what I'm 
hoping to do next year," said Nancy Bianconi, director of housing operations 
for L.A. Family Housing, the nonprofit group that operates the shelter. 
In the meantime, homeless advocates say, they will continue to push for 
winter-long activation of shelters and elimination of the 40-degree rule. 
The 40-degree cutoff aside, some city officials are not eager to return to the 
motel-voucher program. Robert Vilmur, the city's homeless projects coordinator, 
stressed that the armory program is superior to motels because the city can 
provide dinner and breakfast. A public health nurse is on call for medical 
needs, and social service workers are available for counseling. 
In addition to providing more comprehensive services, the shelter program is 
less expensive. The cost of housing a person in a shelter is between $9 and 
$10; the cost of putting them up in a motel averages $25 a night. Last year 
$719,000 in city and federal emergency housing funds were spent citywide on 
motel and shelter expenses. Expenditures so far this year have not yet been 
tabulated. 
The armory also eliminates what some suspect was widespread abuse of the motel 
program, said Jim Bird of Better Valley Services, the nonprofit social service 
organization that distributed the free vouchers last year. 
Bird said he and his workers suspected that people living in overcrowded 
apartments would seek motel vouchers for a respite. Also, families living in 
motels because they could not afford apartments would ask for vouchers to save 
money. 
"There was no way whether we could determine if people were homeless or not," 
Bird said. "The armory pretty much screens out the marginally homeless. The 
shelter is not an incentive that draws people who are doubled up in apartments, 
living in substandard housing or in cars." 
But for the Enriquez family, it was all they had Tuesday night. Their 
experience with the shelter exemplifies the strengths and weaknesses of the 
program, officials said. 
The family -- James, Linda and their five children, ages 1 to 8 -- exhausted 
their savings Monday night after living nearly a month in a motel. Enriquez 
said he had been laid off from his job with a moving company. Money was tight. 
So when cockroach and plumbing problems were not eliminated, he withheld rent 
and his family was evicted, he said. 
Without a car, the family packed their clothes in plastic sacks and spent 
Tuesday at a Van Nuys Boulevard coffee shop while James begged for quarters to 
make telephone calls to find shelter. 
He called a Van Nuys church group named Loaves and Fishes and was given a 
toll-free number -- 800-548-6047 -- for cold-weather shelter information. The 
operator directed him to Van Nuys City Hall, where a special bus would pick 
them up and take them to the shelter. 
For three hours in the dark, with an icy wind howling, the family sat on the 
steps of City Hall. 
They didn't know they had missed the bus. 
About 8 p.m., Enriquez said, a man offered to give them a ride to the shelter. 
"We drove around the street for about half an hour but couldn't find the place. 
The man was getting mad," he said. Then they noticed a small, hand-painted sign 
against a light pole with an arrow pointing toward "armory shelter." 
"It was warm inside; they were real nice," Enriquez said. His family was fed 
soup and sandwiches. "I don't know where we would have gone without it." 
In the morning, lights were flicked on at 5:30 a.m, causing the children to 
cry. 
Then, at 6:15 a.m., after a breakfast of fruit-flavored juice and doughnuts, 
the family was told they had to board a yellow school bus that would take them 
back to the streets. 
The older children, bundled in jackets and hats, carried their belongings in 
backpacks. Linda held a bag of disposable diapers and a sack of sandwiches from 
the shelter. 
They stayed on the bus as long as they could, finally getting off on Van Nuys 
Boulevard near Parthenia Street. Enriquez said they intended to go to a church 
to ask for some money. Then they would walk to a Laundromat. The heat from the 
dryers would warm the children, he reasoned. 
"I wish my wife and children could have stayed at the shelter so I could go 
look for a job," Enriquez said. "I can't leave them alone in a park or 
something all day." 
"But I'm glad we could stay there. We won't miss the bus tonight, we're going 
to be at the stop right at 5," he said. "I hope it's cold again." 
But Wednesday night the shelter doors were closed. 
The temperature in the Valley was 41 degrees.
