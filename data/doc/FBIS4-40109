  [Text] Moscow 13 June TASS -- Ukraine's Navy leaders 
protested on Monday [13 June] the illegal transfer of property 
from the Black Sea Fleet. 
  In a letter to the Black Sea Fleet commanders, Ukrainian 
Navy 
officers said that military equipment and property are being 
illegally transferred from the Crimean navy base and other units. 
  The letter recalled that the transportation of military 
equipment in Ukraine must be approved by the Ukrainian chief of 
general staff. 
  The authors of the letter regretted that such actions are 
happening at a time when the future of the Black Sea Fleet 
remains unclear and expressed the hope that the Black Sea Fleet 
commanders will ensure the enforcement of law and order in their 
units.
