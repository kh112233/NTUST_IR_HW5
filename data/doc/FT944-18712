FT  03 OCT 94 / Turkey in threat to Greece
Turkey has threatened Greece with war if Athens extends its territorial
waters in the Aegean into Turkish territory, foreign minister Mr Mumtaz
Soysal said yesterday. Mr Soysal said he issued the warning to his Greek
counterpart, Mr Karolos Papoulias, while both were at the UN General
Assembly last week. 'The Greek foreign minister told me that (Greece) had
the right to extend its waters to 12 miles. I said that would lead to very
serious consequences. We let it be known that we didn't want war but would
go to war in such a situation.' Mr Soysal has gained a reputation for being
tough on Turkey's traditional rival, Greece, since becoming foreign minister
in July. Though Nato allies, Turkey and Greece came to the brink of war in
1987 in a row over mineral rights in the Aegean.
