Staffers from two European television stations in unrelated incidents attempted 
to put fake bombs aboard scheduled airline flights in apparent journalistic 
tests of airport security. At New York's Kennedy Airport, Bruce Frankel, a 
producer, and Alain Chaillou, a bureau chief for French station TF1, were 
arrested after phony bombs with mocking notes were left for shipment on 
Paris-bound flights. In Amsterdam, TV station Veronica filmed one of its 
reporters carrying an attache case with an imitation bomb through security and 
onto a plane at Schipol Airport. Air France, TWA and Pan Am were the New York 
"targets."
