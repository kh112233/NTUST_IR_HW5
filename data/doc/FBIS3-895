  [Text] Kampala, March 15 (AFP)--At least five civilians 
died in crossfire during a fierce battle between government 
forces and Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels in 
northern Uganda's Gulu district last Thursday [10 March], the 
official NEW VISION newspaper reported Tuesday. 
  The fighting followed heavy deployment of heavily-armed 
government National Resistance Army (NRA) troops in northern 
Uganda last week, which were reported to have taken up positions 
along Kitgum-Lira road, an area where rebel activity had 
intensified considerably. 
  The rebels stepped up their operations after peace talks 
with 
the government stalled last January. 
  In Thursday's encounter, which forced civilians to flee as 
the gunbattle raged, several other people were reported injured. 
There were no details on the number of soldiers casualties, but 
an NRA truck was seen at Minanuki ferrying bodies of those 
killed in the latest clashes. 
  An eyewitness said an unidentified woman lost one leg after 
she was hit by an rocket-propelled shell as she tried to run to 
safety. 
  Another fierce battle broke out the following day at 
Lela-Lakim lasting over three hours, which may have claimed 
more civilians casualties, New Vision also said. 
  During the two days of battle, many of the local people were 
said to have been ordered to leave their homes for safer zones. 
  This has been one of the bloodiest clashes between the NRA 
and the rebels since the government ordered a counter offensive 
to wipe out the rebels and end the bloody six-year civil war.
