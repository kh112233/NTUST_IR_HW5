LOCAL; 
ELDERLY COUPLE, YOUNG WOMAN IDENTIFIED IN FATAL IRVINE CRASH 
An elderly Laguna Hills couple and an Irvine woman were killed Tuesday night in 
a three-car collision that also left a 32-year-old man with minor injuries and 
forced closure of Irvine Center Drive until late this morning. 
John Feltman, 75, and his wife, Celia, 73, were traveling along a rural stretch 
of the road from their Leisure World home when the car in which they were 
riding drifted into oncoming traffic, Irvine Police Lt. Bob Leonard said. 
Their 1988 Mercury Marquis smashed headlong into a 1987 Chevrolet Camaro driven 
by Beth A. Ward, 26, who was traveling eastbound along Irvine Center Drive near 
Valencia Avenue, Leonard said. 
The Marquis then flipped over and struck a 1986 Ford Bronco II that was being 
driven by Jeffrey Snyder, a computer programmer. 
The Feltmans and Ward were pronounced dead at the scene, Leonard said. Snyder 
was taken to nearby Saddleback Memorial Medical Center, where he was treated 
for a bruised knee and a strained neck and later released, Leonard said. 
Leonard said investigators were trying to determine why Feltman was driving on 
the wrong side of the road.
