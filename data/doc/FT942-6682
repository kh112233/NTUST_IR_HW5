FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Chunnel visions
The light at the end of Eurotunnel means that those who bought shares in
November 1987 for the travel perks they offered will soon be able to make
their free trips. But was it worthwhile?
The timing of the original offer was not good, coming right after the stock
market crash. To lure private investors, shares were offered at 350p with
these concessions:
100 shares: one free trip through the Chunnel within a year of its opening.
500 shares: one return trip a year for 10 years.
1,000 shares: two return journeys every year until the end of Eurotunnel's
concession (originally 2042 but extended last December to 2052).
1,500 shares: as many trips as you like until 2052.
To benefit, shareholders must pay an annual registration fee of Pounds 15
and a Pounds 1 nominal charge for each journey.
The chart, re-based to 350, shows how the Eurotunnel shares have performed
in relation to the FT-SE-A All Share index (gross dividends re-invested) and
a 90-day Halifax building society account (gross income re-invested).
In fact, investors who have held on to their shares have done better than
the options. Return fares on Le Shuttle range from Pounds 220 to Pounds 310,
depending on the time of year the trip is made. If you had paid Pounds 350
to qualify for one return journey in the first year, and wanted to travel in
the most expensive period, you would have benefited to the tune of Pounds
327, allowing you to make another free trip.
The calculation assumes that Eurotunnel's price holds at Thursday's close of
348p. So, you would have paid Pounds 350 and got back Pounds 348.
There was a rights issue in 1990. If you had not taken it up, the value of
the nil-paid shares would amount to Pounds 35 for someone holding 100. Thus,
you made a 'profit' of Pounds 33 and got a trip worth Pounds 310. Since you
have to pay a further Pounds 16 for the journey, your total gain is Pounds
327.
You would have done less well by investing in a share matching the
performance of the All Share. Although the market has done well, turning
Pounds 350 into Pounds 875, paying for the Pounds 310 trip leaves a Pounds
215 gain.
The building society investor would have made Pounds 221 by depositing
Pounds 350 and getting back Pounds 571. But forking out for the Pounds 310
fare means he is out of pocket by Pounds 89.
Given the volatility of the Eurotunnel share price, shareholders cannot do
their sums until after their journey. The wiliest would have sold their
shares when the price reached a high of Pounds 11.64 in 1989. With Pounds
810 profit in hand, they could have bought a round-the-world airline ticket.
