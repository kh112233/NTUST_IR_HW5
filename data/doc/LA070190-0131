2 POLICE OFFICERS KILLED; IRA CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY 
A gunman opened fire on police on a busy downtown shopping street Saturday, 
killing two officers. The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the 
attack. 
As shoppers watched, the gunman shot the officers and then fled through the 
grounds of nearby St. Mary's Catholic Church. 
The officers had been on duty only yards from a security gate at the junction 
of Castle Street and Queen Street, one of the busiest shopping areas in 
Belfast. Witnesses said they heard five shots. 
An elderly woman, speaking on condition she not be identified, said: "I must 
have come on the scene minutes after it happened. People were feeling for a 
pulse on one policeman, but I don't think he was alive. He seemed to be very 
young and only starting out in life. 
"You see things like this on television, but it's hard to take in when you see 
it at firsthand. The people who did this are a disgrace to . . . the land they 
live in." 
The second policeman died later in a Belfast hospital, police said. 
The IRA, which has targeted the security forces in its fight to end British 
rule in Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call 
to the Belfast office of Britain's domestic news agency, Press Assn. 
The deaths brought to four the number of Royal Ulster Constabulary officers 
killed this year, and to 29 the number of people killed in sectarian and 
political violence in Northern Ireland, officials said. 
The IRA wants to unite Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland with the 
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. 
Meanwhile, in Amsterdam, a bomb exploded outside the British national tourist 
office late Saturday, breaking windows but causing no injuries, police said. 
The building also houses the offices of British Airways. 
No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but officials there noted that the 
IRA has frequently targeted British facilities on the Continent.
