FT  15 AUG 94 / Probe starts into train accident
An investigation into a crash involving an express train and a locomotive
without its driver, which injured more than 50 people, was being held last
night.
The driverless locomotive collided with the Newquay-Edinburgh InterCity at
Abbeyhill, a mile east of Edinburgh's Waverley station on Saturday night.
A Railtrack official said the InterCity driver received a warning from
signal workers two minutes before the collision and had time to stop his
train and get into the back of his cab. He was trapped in his cab for an
hour and had both legs injured.
Two passengers were detained in hospital last night and more than 50 others
were treated for cuts, bruises and shock after the crash.
Mr Paul Prescott, director of Railtrack Scotland, said the signalling system
operated perfectly and was not implicated in the accident. The inquiry would
concentrate on how the driverless locomotive came to leave its last stop.
He said: 'We will be looking particularly at whether the brakes were fully
applied and were fully functioning.
'Clearly at some stage between 6.30pm and 8.30pm the locomotive set off
under the force of gravity, ran through some points and eventually collided
with the high speed train, which was stationary at a signal.'
The locomotive driver has been suspended.
