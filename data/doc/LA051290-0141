ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LONG BEACH MAN IS KILLED IN CRASH 
A Long Beach man was killed Friday when his car slammed into a bridge in Buena 
Park, police said. 
William J. Baxter, 21, died at the scene following the 1:16 a.m. accident, said 
Buena Park Police Officer Rich McMillen. 
The accident occurred on Valley View Street south of Artesia Boulevard. 
Baxter, who was alone in the car, apparently drifted across a lane and rammed 
into a concrete section of a bridge spanning a flood-control channel of Coyote 
Creek, police said. 
After crashing into the bridge, the 1990 Ford Probe slammed into a light pole, 
McMillen said. 
Baxter died from massive head and internal injuries. 
An investigation indicated that the man was driving at a minimum speed of 65 
m.p.h., police said.
