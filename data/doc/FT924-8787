FT  10 NOV 92 / Protest chaos dismays Bonn
GERMANY reacted with dismay yesterday to the public relations disaster which
resulted from Sunday's huge anti-racist demonstration in Berlin, when it
ended in anarchists pelting the state president with eggs.
While political leaders insisted the scale of the 300,000-strong
demonstration was an overwhelming statement of the country's opposition to
neo-Nazi attacks on foreigners and asylum-seekers, the media saw the violent
protests by some 300 left-wingers as a terrible blow to Germany's
international image.
The extreme left celebrated the event as a triumph for their tactics of
'exposing the hypocrisy of the politicians', and undermining the deliberate
'propaganda show' of the political establishment.
The sorry end to what had been an impressive and powerful display of
national disgust for the recent rash of violent skinhead attacks on refugee
hostels has unleashed a new wave of questioning over the ability of the main
political parties to solve the country's acutely sensitive immigration
problem. The political irrelevance of the 300-odd left-wing extremists is
rapidly being submerged in the emotional response.
The conservative newspaper Die Welt called the outcome 'a black Sunday' in a
special front-page commentary.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called it 'an awful spectacle,' demanded
harsh action against the protesters, but called above all for the opposition
Social Democrats (SPD) to agree on radical changes in the law to enable the
inflow of would-be immigrants to be controlled.
The SPD leadership agreed at the weekend that 'clarification and
amplification' of the country's constitution guaranteeing the right of
asylum would be possible - provided the basic right of asylum remained
untouched.
They also called for a European quota system for immigrants, and agreed that
Germany should refuse entry to any asylum-seekers already rejected by other
EC member states.
