  [Text] Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA) -- Legislators from both the 
ruling party and opposition on Friday demanded that the 
government review its policy regarding Mainland Chinese 
hijackers who commandeer passengers planes to Taiwan, saying it 
is not harsh enough to curb the cross-strait air piracy. 
  Both Kuomintang Legislator Hung Chao-nan and Democratic 
Progressive Party Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung insisted that the 
existing measures be thoroughly reviewed. 
  Mainland hijackers have been sentenced to up to 15 years in 
prison here, but under current policy, will not be repatriated 
to the mainland after they serve their terms. 
  The two lawmakers made the remarks following reports that a 
Boeing 737 aircraft with 122 passengers and eight crew members 
on board was diverted to Taiwan Friday morning as it was en 
route from Chengdu to Fuzhou, a city in the southern coastal 
province of China. 
  It was the 11th mainland passenger aircraft commandeered to 
Taiwan since last April. 
  Hung also called on the military to step up air security. 
Some government officials here believe that Beijing may be 
using the hijackings to test Taiwan's air defense capability, 
though no sophisticated electronic devices designed to collect 
military information have been found on any hijacked aircraft. 
  Shen, however, remained concerned about the possibility of 
such a scheme. He said he could not figure out why Mainland 
China's air security personnel had yielded to hijackers equipped 
with "the most ludicrous hijacking weapons in the world." 
  In Friday's case, Lin Wenqiang, 36, hijacked a Southwest 
China Airlines Boeing 737 to the island with a knife and a glass 
filled with tissue paper, which Lin claimed was an explosive. 
  Shen and Hung also asked the government to press mainland 
authorities to strengthen flight security checks and step up 
their anti-air piracy publicity campaign.
