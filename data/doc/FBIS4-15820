  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 11, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar returned Sunday [10 April] from a working visit to 
Norway, the government's press service told BNS. 
  Laar met on Friday with his Norwegian counterpart Gro Harlem 
Brundtland. The two premiers discussed the development of 
Estonian-Norwegian cooperation, the situation at 
Estonian-Russian negotiations, integration of the Baltic states 
into Europe, Norway's talks with the European Union, Norway's 
assistance to Estonia to develop the Partnership for Peace 
program and to set up the Baltic peacekeeping battalion, and the 
construction of a Baltic gas pipeline. 
  Brundtland expressed support for Estonia's demand that 
Russian troops must promptly and unconditionally leave Estonia 
in keeping with the international obligations Moscow has assumed. 
  The two premiers said they were satisfied that the relations 
between their countries were becoming closer, and that the links 
would be further promoted by the opening of the Estonian Embassy 
in Oslo. "We must go out into the world more, speak about who we 
are," Laar said, "then the world, too, will take more interest 
in us." 
  The Norwegian premier also gave her backing to the steps 
Estonia and the other Baltic states have been taking to forge 
closer ties with Europe. 
  Laar addressed on Saturday a congress of the Norwegian 
conservative Hoyre party. He spoke about Estonia's path to 
Europe and the Nordic states' role in the process. Estonia 
takes a road to Europe similar to that of the Nordic countries, 
the premier said, starting with economic cooperation with 
European countries and then proceeding to political negotiations. 
  The Estonian premier had meetings with the Hoyre party's 
leaders and with members of the parliamentary foreign affairs 
and national defense commissions. The meetings attached great 
importance to the Baltic states remaining outside the East's 
sphere of influence as one of guarantees for Norway's security.
