FT  07 JAN 92 / US call for halt to silicone breast implants
THE US Food and Drug Administration called on doctors yesterday to stop
using silicone breast implants in patients, saying 'troubling questions'
remained about their safety, write Karen Zagor and Clive Cookson.
The FDA, which is seeking the move while new information on implants is
assessed, also asked manufacturers to stop distributing the products until
an advisory panel has met. Recommendations are expected within 45 days.
Saline-filled implants will not be affected by the moratorium.
According to the FDA, about 20 per cent of the 1m women in the US with
implants have them for breast reconstruction after cancer surgery. The
remaining 80 per cent have them for cosmetic reasons.
Silicone breast implants have been far less popular in the UK than in the
US. Only a few thousand British women have had implants.
The Department of Health said: 'We are waiting to see what the FDA does. We
are looking at their new data but are not making any recommendations for the
moment.'
The FDA's decision is the second blow in less than four weeks to Dow Corning
Wright, a subsidiary of Dow Corning and the leading US implant maker.
In mid-December, a federal court ordered Dow Corning to pay a woman Dollars
7.3m (Pounds 4m) in compensatory and punitive damages for hiding evidence
which linked ruptured silicone gel implants with auto-immune disorders.
Dow Corning has said it will appeal against the decision.
Other big implant makers include Bioplasty, Mentor and McGhan Medical. On
Wall Street, shares in Mentor tumbled Dollars 2 to Dollars 12 1/4 before
trading in the issue was halted at midday yesterday. Shares in Bioplasty
were also halted.
