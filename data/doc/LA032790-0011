FLEISCHMAN ON ABORTION 
Fleischman cites test-tube babies as irrefutable proof that "life" begins the 
moment an egg is fertilized, and that destroying a fertilized egg amounts to 
killing a person. This, of course, is tantamount to calling every doctor a 
killer when he discards those eggs fertilized in-vitro that are surplus and 
therefore not used for implant. 
The same shoddy logic -- cleverly disguised as a nonpartisan dissertation -- 
goes into the "circular reasoning" of using the conclusion of the argument as 
its premise. 
To top it all off, the author is identified not as the pro-life activist she 
is, but as "an attorney with a special interest in reproduction issues as a 
function of civil liberties and human rights." 
Giving such prominent exposure -- even in the Opinion Section -- to this kind 
of sophistry and implying that the author is a civil libertarian -- a term 
associated with the pro-choice movement -- comes awfully close to willful 
deception.
