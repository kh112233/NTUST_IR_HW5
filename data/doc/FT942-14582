FT  20 APR 94 / Bond hearing on bankruptcy
Mr Alan Bond, former Australian tycoon, yesterday abandoned a request for a
hearing into his mental fitness and agreed to appear at a bankruptcy
examination next month, writes Nikki Tait.
On Mr Bond's admission to a private hospital in Perth in February, a
psychiatric report said he was suffering from depression, and would be put
on Prozac, the anti-depressant drug. But yesterday Mr Michael Barnett, Mr
Bond's lawyer, told the Federal Court in Sydney Mr Bond did not want to air
intimate details on his mental health in public, or subject family and
friends to scrutiny on the subject.
