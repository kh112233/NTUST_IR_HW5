FT  25 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Handy' microscope developed by
Sharp
Sharp of Japan has developed what it claims to be the first 'handy'
microscope to feature a still image display. Users point the microscope at
the subject and a clearly magnified image is projected on to a display
monitor.
The YH-750M microscope costs around Y400,000 (Pounds 2,600). Up to three
still images can be stored for display. Sharp says it should be particularly
useful for skin and hair diagnoses, surface inspection of precision
machinery and parts, dental examination and as a teaching aid.
