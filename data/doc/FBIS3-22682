<F P=106> [Report by Yuliy Semenenko: "Imported AIDS"] </F>
  [Text] "Businessmen" coming to our country via the Psou 
checkpoint between Abkhazia and Russia are not only importing 
weapons, drugs, and counterfeit money, but often AIDS too. 
However, until very recently there was no opportunity to block 
the spread of this disease. Now the situation is changing. 
Under a decision by the Greater Sochi Administration, all 
foreigners coming to our country, including inhabitants of the 
Transcaucasus, must present an international certificate saying 
they have been tested for the virus, or undergo a test then and 
there on the border. It is a harsh measure, but a necessary one.
