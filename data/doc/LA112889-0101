2 KILLED, TWO DOZEN HURT AS TRAIN HITS ABC-TV BUS 
A commuter train collided with a charter bus, killing two people and injuring 
about two dozen others during the rush hour Monday evening, police said. 
The two victims were employees of ABC-TV, which chartered the bus to carry 
workers and guests around the San Francisco Bay Area, according to South San 
Francisco police. The employees were in town for the broadcast of Monday Night 
Football. Bus passengers included network employees and ABC clients, police 
said. 
The victims were not identified pending notification of family. One was a sales 
executive based in Los Angeles and the other an executive with ABC Sports in 
New York, according to the network. 
Bus driver Paul Cang, 33, of Foster City was reported in stable condition at 
Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame with a head laceration. The other injured were 
treated at hospitals and released or treated for minor injuries at the scene. 
The bus was the third in a convoy of four vehicles of ABC employees and clients 
who had taken a bay cruise and were headed to Candlestick Park to watch the 
49ers play the New York Giants, ABC said. 
The train did not derail and none of its passengers was injured, according to 
Southern Pacific, which operates the CalTrain commuter. 
The bus was crossing the tracks at Oyster Point Boulevard and Old Bayshore 
Highway but had to stop behind a double tractor-trailer truck.
