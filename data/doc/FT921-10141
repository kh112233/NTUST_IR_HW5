FT  07 FEB 92 / Channel rail order for GEC Alsthom
THE long-delayed order for Channel tunnel sleeper trains is to be awarded to
GEC Alsthom, British Rail said yesterday.
The decision on the contract - thought to be worth Pounds 115m - clears the
way for night trains to start running from Britain's regions to Paris and
Brussels from late in 1994.
There will also be two Continental sleeper services from London each night.
One will go to Amsterdam and the other to Cologne, dividing into portions
for Dortmund and Frankfurt.
All 139 Channel tunnel sleeping cars are to be built at GEC Alsthom's
Metro-Cammell plant in Washwood Heath, east Birmingham.
The contract is unlikely to be formally placed for several weeks because the
leasing deal which is expected to finance it has yet to be arranged.
The premature announcement of the contract may give rise to suspicions that
it is intended to mollify the regions in the run-up to the general election.
