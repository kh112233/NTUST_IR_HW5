DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
WOMAN KILLED AS VAN SWERVES OFF FREEWAY 
A Glendale woman was killed Friday morning when her van mysteriously swerved 
off the Glendale Freeway. 
The California Highway Patrol has been unable to determine what caused the 
crash, said Officer Tami Low of the CHP's Verdugo Hills substation. 
Low said Lili Amirian, 34, was driving south between 8:20 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. 
Witnesses said the vehicle was in one of the middle two lanes and suddenly 
swerved to the outside, Low said. 
The van turned end-over-end and came to rest in a culvert on the side of the 
freeway. 
Amirian was pronounced dead at the scene. Her son Edwin, 2, survived with only 
a bump on the head, probably because he was strapped into an infant car 
restrainer in the back seat, Low said. 
The van showed no sign of mechanical defect, and all four of its tires were 
intact, Low said.
