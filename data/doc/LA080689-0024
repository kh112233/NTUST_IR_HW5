G'DAY AUSTRALIA 
As an Australian, "G'bye California, G'day Australia" (by Sean Mitchell, June 
25) made me painfully aware of a few of the things I love and miss about 
Australia: fresh air, intense colors, unurbanized beaches, the slower, 
easy-going pace and the unique spirit of the land. 
However, I also love the United States, and California in particular, for some 
of the very things that Australia seems to have less of -- energy, 
entrepreneurial vision and tumultuous variety. Here is a country that seems to 
encompass everything. After about four and a half years here, it seems 
pointless to try to decide which is the better country to live in. Like any 
place, each country lacks something simply by having something different to 
offer. 
For me, the important aspect of living outside Australia is trying to transcend 
the petty side of nationalism and patriotism and opening up to the subtleties 
of different cultures.
