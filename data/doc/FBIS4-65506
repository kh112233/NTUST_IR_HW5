  [Text] Magdeburg (DPA) -- In the course of the 
investigation against suspected participants in the xenophobic 
riots in Magdeburg on Ascension Day [12 May] a sixth arrest 
warrant has been issued. It applies to an adult hooligan, who is 
suspected of having violated the laws relating to civil disorder 
and rioting in a particularly serious case, Senor Public 
Prosecutor Rudolf Jaspers told DPA on Wednesday [18 May]. He 
probably participated in the hunt for foreigners and the 
storming of the Marietta Bar, into which the attacked persons 
had fled.
