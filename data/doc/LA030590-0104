ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 
HERE, DEAF CAN BE LIKE THE OTHERS 
High school senior Debbie Hughes of Fountain Valley has goals much like other 
teen-agers: She wants to go to UC Davis and become a veterinarian. 
But for Debbie, pursuing them means traveling the many miles to University High 
School in Irvine. 
Debbie, who is deaf, is one of 67 Orange County teen-agers enrolled in the 
county's only program for the hearing-impaired that allows them to attend 
regular classes with their hearing peers. 
The students in the program also participate in all the activities that are 
part of a regular high school life. Their circumstances are acknowledged but 
not considered a problem. They are there to interact as much as possible with 
hearing peers. And, like all of the school's students, they are encouraged to 
set goals, such as landing part-time jobs or attending college. There are, 
however, special workshops for the hearing-impaired students to help them with 
any problems. 
"They (administrators) make sure that we participate and treat us all the 
same," Debbie says. 
More than half of the students in the program attend mainstream classes. There 
are interpreters for them in these, and also for any of the extracurricular 
activities they may be pursuing. The interpreters are present during every 
game, practice and meeting. 
The school's sports programs and student government have both counted 
hearing-impaired students among their participants. This year, though, for the 
first time in the history of the program, there is a hearing-impaired student 
on the cheerleading squad. Erika Dickson, a junior, said she is pleased with 
the acceptance she has received. MARCI HANOVER
