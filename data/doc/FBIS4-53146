  [Text] After 19 years, the U.S. Mobil Oil Company has 
returned to Vietnam to make investments and start operation in 
Vietnam. A responsible person of the company recently said that 
the company would strive to make preparations to start oil 
prospecting in waters near Vietnam's Truong Sa [Spratly] Islands 
as quickly as possible. On 12 May, a U.S. Mobil Oil Company 
spokesman said the company would continue to implement the 
contract signed with Vietnam and explore and prospect for oil 
together with their Vietnamese counterpart in the Thanhlong area 
within Vietanam's territorial waters, and that the first oil 
well would be drilled within the next few months. 
  The above statement was made by the U.S. Mobil Oil Company 
in 
reply to the latest statement issued by the Chinese side.
