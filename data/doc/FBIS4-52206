  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today congratulates the African National 
Congress of South Africa (ANC) on its landslide victory in the 
recently held first ever all-race general elections in history 
in South Africa. Thus the election of Nelson Mandela as the 
first president of a democratic South Africa has become evident, 
it says, adding: This is a victory of the South African people 
and, at the same time, a common victory of the world progressive 
people and a victory of justice. 
  The article says: 
  The Korean people rejoice at the ANC's victory in the 
elections with the world progressive people. 
  With the ANC's victory in the elections the racist rule 
which 
had existed for centuries has been done away with and a new life 
of equality and democracy opened up in South Africa. Tens of 
millions of black people in the country have become able to 
exercise their rights as the masters of their own destinies, 
freed from racialist maltreatment and humiliation, persecution 
and suppression. 
  The South African people will successfully realize their 
aspirations and desire under the leadership of Nelson Mandela. 
  The Korean people sincerely wish their efforts to build a 
new 
South Africa will bear a fine fruit.
