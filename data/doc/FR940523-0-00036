 

The desired gene(s) may be introduced into a host plant by one of several methods, including: (1) Direct DNA uptake
by the plant cells mediated by chemical or electrical treatments; (2) microinjection of DNA directly into plant cells;
(3) biolistics, or firing tiny particles coated with the DNA of interest into plant cells; and (4) the use of a bacterium,
such as the soil bacterium 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens, 

as a vehicle to carry the DNA into plant cells. (For a discussion of these processes, see Ref. 4).


B. Need for a Selectable Marker


Transformation of plant cells by introducing exogenous DNA is an inefficient process and, in general, only a small
proportion of cells will successfully take up, integrate, and express the new genetic material (Ref. 5). Further,
the few cells that do so are not readily distinguishable from the vast majority of cells that do not. Therefore, developers
of transgenic plants need a means to distinguish cells that are successfully transformed from those that are not.
Selectable markers, such as the 

kan



r

 gene, perform this function.
The 

kan



r

 gene is linked to the gene (or genes) of interest and then this genetic material is inserted into plant cells. Because
plant cells are sensitive to the antibiotic kanamycin, incorporation of the 

kan



r

 gene into cells and subsequent expression of APH(3
&rsquo;)II provides a convenient method for selecting successfully transformed cells. 

Kan



r

 works as a marker because only successfully transformed cells (which contain both the 

kan



r

 and the desired genetic material) survive when grown in a kanamycin-containing medium. These cells are subsequently
regenerated into transgenic plants. 


C. Identity of the Additive


APH(3
&rsquo;)II

1

 (CAS Reg. No. 58943398) is encoded by the 

kan



r

 gene, which was originally isolated as a component of transposon Tn

5



2

 from the bacterium 

Escherichia coli 

(Refs. 6 and 7). APH(3
&rsquo;)II is an enzyme with an apparent molecular weight of 25,000 that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group
from adenosine 5
&rsquo;-triphosphate (ATP) to a hydroxyl group of aminoglycoside antibiotics (see below), thereby inactivating
the antibiotics.

Other names for this enzyme include neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II), neomycin phosphotransferase, and
kanamycin phosphotransferase II.

A transposon is a segment of DNA that is mobile and has the capacity to move from one site in the genome to another. Transposons
vary in size and frequently contain, as does Tn

5

, antibiotic resistance genes in addition to genes coding for functions concerned with movement of the transposon.

</FOOTNOTE>


APH(3
&rsquo;)II inactivates the aminoglycoside antibiotics neomycin, kanamycin, paromomycin, ribostamycin, gentamicins
A and B, as well as butirosins (Refs. 8 and 9). Of the antibiotics that are inactivated by APH(3
&rsquo;)II, only neomycin and kanamycin are currently approved for use in humans or animals in the United States (Refs.
10 and 11).

Gentamicin, which is used therapeutically, is composed of a complex mixture of the antibiotic substances produced
by 

Micromonospora purpurea 

that contain primarily gentamicin C

1

 (25 to 50 percent), gentamicin C

1a

 (10 to 35 percent), and gentamicins C

2a

 and C

2

 (25 to 55 percent) (Ref. 10). Gentamicins A and B are at most minor components of the commercial drug. Thus, APH(3
&rsquo;)II does not confer resistance to gentamicin that is used therapeutically (Ref. 12).

</FOOTNOTE>


The APH(3
&rsquo;)II evaluated in this document is the enzyme whose synthesis is directed by the 

kan



r

 gene derived from transposon Tn

5

. This enzyme is not to be confused with enzymes that may be similarly named (e.g., a type I aminoglycoside phosphotransferase
encoded by a gene isolated from transposon Tn601) or other bacterial enzymes (including acetyltransferases, nucleotidyltransferases,
and phosphotransferases) that inactivate kanamycin and neomycin (Refs. 8 and 12).


D. Use and Intended Technical Effects


Aminoglycoside antibiotics exert their effect on bacteria by binding to bacterial ribosomes and inhibiting protein
synthesis. Phosphorylation of the antibiotics by APH(3
&rsquo;)II interferes with this binding and thus prevents the antibiotics from inhibiting protein synthesis (Ref.
13). In this way, cells that contain the 

kan



r

 gene and that express APH(3
&rsquo;)II are rendered resistant to the action of the antibiotics. In plant cells, the antibiotics exert their effect
on mitochondria and chloroplasts where protein synthesis takes place on ribosomes that resemble bacterial ribosomes
(Ref. 14).
The proposed use of the 

kan



r

 gene and gene product APH(3
&rsquo;)II is as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape intended
for food use. As discussed above, because transformation of plant cells is an inefficient process, the presence of
APH(3
&rsquo;)II and the consequent ability of the plant cells to grow in the presence of antibiotics is used to distinguish
between transformed and nontransformed cells. Therefore, the intended technical effect of APH(3
&rsquo;)II is to permit, in the early phases of development of genetically modified plants, the selection of transformants
carrying the 

kan



r

 gene along with the genetic material of interest. However, APH(3
&rsquo;)II has no intended technical effect in the final plant or final crop product.


III. Safety Evaluation


A. APH(3
&rsquo;)II


Safety issues associated with APH(3
&rsquo;)II can be divided into two areas: (1) Those associated with the direct effects of ingestion of the protein,
including the possibility of allergenicity; and (2) those associated with the biological activity of APH(3
&rsquo;)II (i.e., the effect of the enzyme on the therapeutic efficacy of orally administered antibiotics).
