 

The agency also agrees with the comment which stated that it was an unproven hypothesis that overuse of an antiseptic
causes 

Pseudomonas

 overgrowth. The ``Summary for Basis of Approval'' from an approved NDA for chlorhexidine gluconate (Ref. 1) cites
a skin flora study that indicated that the axilla was an area where gram-negative micro-organisms continued to be
isolated even though chlorhexidine gluconate has shown gram-negative effectiveness. The comment cited FDA's Division
of Anti-Infective Drug Products' recognition that for health-care uses, such as surgical scrub and health-care
personnel handwash, there would be no problem with 

Pseudomonas

 overgrowth because the hands are an area of the body not likely to support the growth of 

Pseudomonas

 because of the lack of moisture. In defending triclosan, the comment contended that this ingredient is bacteriostatic
and does not eliminate all gram-positive bacteria; therefore, it would not predispose for gram-negative overgrowth.
Triclosan has been implicated in 

Pseudomonas

 contamination because it is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria, has limited in vitro and in vivo
activity against gram-negative bacteria, and no activity against 

Pseudomonas

 (43 FR 1210 at 1232). One report showed that triclosan was effective against some gram-negative micro-organisms,
but not effective against 

Serratia

 and 

Pseudomonas

 (Ref. 11). 

Pseudomonas

 and 

Serratia

 resistance caused the contamination, not overuse of the antiseptic. 

The agency agrees with the comments that quaternary ammonium compounds and triclosan have been implicated in 

Pseudomonas

 hospital infections more frequently than povidone-iodine, but studies indicate that `overuse' of these or any antimicrobial
has not been the cause. 

Pseudomonas

 species may become dominant because of inherent resistant factors which enable them to survive the effects of many
antibiotics and antiseptics (Refs. 12, 13, and 14). In addition, this genus is ubiquitous, found in both soil and water,
and can multiply in almost any moist environment with even a trace of organic material (Ref. 15). 

The agency believes that the data and reports have not provided specific evidence that repeated use of health-care
antiseptics, including benzalkonium chloride and triclosan, have brought about overgrowth of gram-negative bacteria,
particularly 

Pseudomonas

. The agency agrees with the comments that improper use, failure of hospital personnel to use according to labeling
indications, nonaseptic technique in diluting and handling, and lack of good quality control to ensure sterility
of items in contact with antiseptics, such as sterile distilled water, hosing, and receptacles, are responsible.


The study by Houang et al. (Ref. 3) shows that repeated in vitro exposure of seven gram-negative micro-organisms,
including 

P. aeruginosa

, in povidone-iodine dilutions did not result in the development of resistance. The agency notes that CDC previously
recommended povidone-iodine for use in intravenous catheter and other procedures (Ref. 2). However, there has been
one report from CDC (Ref. 16) which described 

Pseudomonas

 hospital infections caused by intrinsically contaminated povidone-iodine (contaminated during manufacture,
indicating failure of control of microbiological contamination). Compliance with the agency's regulations governing
current good manufacturing practice for finished pharmaceuticals (21 CFR part 211) should prevent intrinsic contamination.


Accordingly, the agency concludes that a cautionary statement against overuse is not needed in the professional
labeling of health-care antiseptic drug products. Therefore, the previously proposed caution in 333.99(a)
is not being included in this tentative final monograph. If new information indicates a need for a cautionary statement,
the agency will consider appropriate action at that time.
