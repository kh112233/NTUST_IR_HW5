Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Final Rule To 
Establish Additional Manatee Protection Areas in Kings Bay, Crystal 
River, Florida 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This final rule establishes three additional permanent 
manatee (

Trichechus manatus

) sanctuaries and expands an existing 
sanctuary in Kings Bay, Crystal River, Florida. All waterborne 
activities will be prohibited in these sanctuaries from November 15 
through March 31 of each year. This final action will prevent the 
taking of manatees by harassment resulting from waterborne activities 
during the winter months. The total number of sanctuaries in Kings 
Bay is increased from three (10.7 acres) to six (39.0 acres) to 
accommodate the growing number of manatees using the area each 
winter, and to offset the harassment from increasing public use. 
This action is taken under the authority of the Endangered Species 
Act of 1973, as amended, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 
1972.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Background 



Crystal River is a short tidal river on the west coast of 
Florida. Forming the headwaters of Crystal River is Kings Bay, a 
lake-like body of water fed by many freshwater springs. These 
springs, because of their year-round temperature of over 74
&cir; F, 
provide an essential warm-water wintering area for West Indian 
manatees (

Trichechus manatus

), a federally listed endangered species. 

During cold weather, many of the manatees wintering in Kings Bay 
congregate in an area known as the main spring or Kings Spring, 
located just south of Banana Island. This location is also a 
favorite site for skin and scuba divers, who come to Kings Bay for 
the clear, calm conditions favorable for learning diving techniques, 
coupled with the opportunity to ``swim with the manatees''. Diver use 
of this area is especially heavy during the cold winter months when 
diving is impractical through most of the northern states, and when 
the opportunity for manatee encounters is greatest. 

The concurrent use of the main spring area by divers and 
manatees during cold weather creates a problem for manatees. 
Manatees are shy, harmless creatures that are easily driven away from 
warm springs by human activity (Buckingham 1990).
