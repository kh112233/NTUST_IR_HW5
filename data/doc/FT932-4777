FT  08 JUN 93 / Critics round on English tests
THE NATIONAL curriculum test papers in English reading and writing for
14-year-olds, published by the Department for Education yesterday, received
a critical reaction from teachers and educationalists.
Ms Ann Barnes, of the National Association for the Teaching of English,
said: 'They do not provide opportunities for the most able pupils to show
what they can do, and they do not provide any opportunities for any sort of
proper reflection on the passage they are asked to read and I think they
probably present very specific hurdles for the lesser pupils.'
Three tests were available, aimed at pupils of differing abilities. Most
children were entered for tier 5-7, aimed at those of average ability, while
about one third were put in for the lower tier and 4 per cent for the higher
tier.
The middle-ability tests offered 15 marks for questions on a passage about a
voyage around the coast of Britain, and then 10 marks each for summarising a
job description for flight attendants, filling in gaps in a passage using
multiple choice options, and paraphrasing the transcript of an interview.
Pupils were then required to write a letter of 120-150 words, requesting
information for a school project.
The National Union of Teachers described the lower-tier tests as 'demeaning'
because they were printed in a larger typeface. It also objected to a
multiple-choice section, saying that all the options offered could in some
cases be technically correct.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, predicted that 'most people will look
at the papers and wonder what all the the fuss was about and wonder why
their children have not been asked to take them'.
