FT  14 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Using the foetus to treat infertility
'Yuk factor' has become the first catchphrase of 1994 in British newspapers.
It does not refer to politicians' private lives, but to the latest
developments in birth technology. People are supposedly saying 'yuk' to
grannies giving birth in their 60s, black women choosing white babies and,
above all, to the potential use of eggs taken from aborted foetuses for
treating infertility.
This may indeed be a natural first reaction to the prospect of removing the
ovaries from a foetus, 'maturing' the eggs in a test tube, fertilising them
with sperm and implanting them in the uterus of a woman whose own eggs are
defective. The public is still squeamish about any medical use of foetal
tissue - for example to treat Parkinson's disease - and it is easy to put
people off the idea of creating a baby whose genetic mother was aborted.
However, initial distaste should not be allowed permanently to block
development of a technique that could help many thousands of infertile
couples, who typically have to wait three to five years to receive eggs from
adult donors. (Giving eggs is an arduous process involving powerful drugs
and an operation.)
Opponents of new birth technologies argue that women have no God-given right
to bear children. But infertility is certainly a painful affliction, even if
it is not a disease in the conventional sense. Although fundamental moral
objections can be raised both to abortion itself and by deduction to any
manipulation of a rejected foetus, these cannot be decisive in a country
such as the UK, where abortion is legal under some circumstances. At the
crudest level of argument, it is surely better to make medical use of foetal
material if possible, than just to throw it into the hospital incinerator.
Moral issues
In the UK, the body responsible for regulating birth technologies is the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which is admired worldwide.
Its members, derived from professional and lay backgrounds, are responsible
for assessing the many subtle moral and practical issues which arise.
One widespread concern is that a child could suffer psychologically from the
knowledge that its genetic mother was, in effect, an aborted foetus.
However, it is not difficult to imagine that the circumstances facing such a
child might be easier to accept than those of an adopted child who was
'rejected', for whatever reason, by both biological parents.
Another minefield will be obtaining informed consent - an essential part of
current donor programmes. Who should give consent on behalf of an aborted
foetus? Just the woman having the abortion? Or should the father of the
foetus have a say (if his identity is known) on the grounds that his genes
should not be passed on to future generations without his knowledge?
Medical decisions
The HFEA will also wish to ensure that women are not encouraged in any way
to have an abortion - or, perhaps more likely, to respond to pressures to
delay the operation so as to give the foetal ovaries more time to develop in
the womb. Medical decisions about the abortion itself must be kept strictly
separate from the procedure for seeking consent to use foetal material in
research or treatment.
The HFEA's record suggests that, if it decides in principle that foetal
ovaries can be used to treat infertility, it will be able to devise a
practical framework in which clinics can operate. The real obstacles would
then be scientific. Although the technique has worked in laboratory animals,
researchers still need to show that there is no excess risk of congenital
abnormality from using eggs from a foetus instead of an adult donor. That
means understanding better the factors that control the decline in egg
numbers from more than 1m in the foetus to less than 100,000 in a fertile
woman; if the body naturally discards inferior eggs during childhood, it
could be dangerous to use foetal ovaries.
Subject to these legal and scientific safeguards, researchers should be
allowed to develop foetal egg donation. If they succeed, the technique will
eventually join the armoury of accepted treatments that aroused distaste
when they were first mooted, including organ transplants and test-tube
babies.
