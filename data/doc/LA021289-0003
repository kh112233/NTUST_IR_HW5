ON THE COVER 
As terrorism increases around the world, so it seems to have surged as the 
theme of prime-time TV productions. 
"The Hijacking of the Achille Lauro," a new TV movie airing Monday at 9 p.m. on 
NBC, is the latest example. It recounts the 1985 terrorist takeover of a luxury 
cruise ship in the Mediterranean. 
Karl Malden and Lee Grant play the pivotal roles as wheelchair-bound Leon 
Klinghoffer and his wife, Marilyn. They were among the American passengers 
asserting themselves against the four terrorists, who ultimately took the life 
of Leon Klinghoffer. 
"The incident," says Grant, "shocked the world because of the terrorists' 
brutality. They tried to strip the hostages of their humanity but were instead 
faced with defiance." 
"The passengers, inspired by the personal strength of the Klinghoffers and 
other Americans," she added, "refused to surrender their dignity. It was a very 
human triumph." 
Also in the cast of writer-director Robert Collins' movie are Vera Miles, E.G. 
Marshall, Christina Pickles and Susan Lyons.
