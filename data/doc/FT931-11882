FT  01 FEB 93 / Bottomley acts over health funding
THE Department of Health is preparing guidance to managers and doctors to
try to ensure that the contract-based system of financing health care runs
more smoothly next year.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has asked top officials to act
following evidence that many hospitals have fulfilled their annual contracts
in the first three quarters of the financial year and are now having to
reduce non-emergency activities.
The National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts says in a survey
published today that over-performance by hospitals has been the most serious
financial issue facing the new system of National Health Service funding in
1992-93.
Mr Bill Darling, association chairman, said the survey showed that the NHS
had spent more money, treated more patients and reduced waiting times in the
current financial year. 'But with many hospitals completing their contracts
early the key challenge for the NHS is to match throughout to resources more
effectively,' he said.
The survey shows that health authorities were most likely to reduce
non-emergency activity when faced with hospitals completing their contracted
activity early. Some intended to maintain services by transferring money
from capital to revenue budgets.
A survey carried out for BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning
reinforces the association's evidence. It indicates that 59.5 per cent of
acute (medical) hospital trusts will have to cancel operations, close wards,
make staff redundant or take other cost-cutting measures before the end of
the financial year. Only 17 per cent of the trusts said contracts were
running smoothly, while managers at 46 per cent believed they would face
worse problems next year.
Mrs Bottomley has asked Sir Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive, and Dr
Kenneth Calman, chief medical officer, to meet doctors' leaders and ensure
that 'everyone understands how the system should be working'.
