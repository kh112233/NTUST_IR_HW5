THE STATE; 
HUMPHREY RETURNS AGAIN 
A healthy Humphrey the whale is back in the San Francisco Bay Area but is 
showing no signs of returning to the Sacramento River, where he spent 25 days 
in 1985 while the world watched and countless efforts were made to send him 
back to sea. For each of the four years since then Humphrey, identified by 
unique markings on his dorsal fin and fluke, has returned to the waters off San 
Francisco. This year he was spotted by biologists swimming near the Farallon 
Islands. Not so lucky are two ailing beaked whales, nicknamed Nicholas and 
Alexander, which are being treated at Marine World/Africa USA in Vallejo. 
Veterinarian Laurie Gage said the condition of the young whales was somewhat 
better than when they were found on Ocean Beach, but they are not eating and 
their chances for survival are not good.
