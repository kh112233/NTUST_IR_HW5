FT  16 MAR 92 / Close verdict forecast for South African poll
SOUTH AFRICA'S white political leaders wound up their referendum campaigns
at the weekend amid forecasts of a closely contested outcome to the poll
that will shape the country's future.
President FW de Klerk, ending a tour of the country in the rightwing
strongholds of Nylstroom and Pietersburg, told audiences the only
alternative to continuing negotiations was violence and civil war. Dr
Andries Treurnicht, rightwing Conservative party leader, said white South
Africans would never accept rule by the African National Congress (ANC).
The government's initial confidence that it would obtain about 60 per cent
of votes in tomorrow's poll has been replaced by alarm at an apparent surge
in support for a 'no' vote.
Although this may be a tactic to encourage 'yes' support, it also reflects
genuine and growing concern that the depth of backing for the rightwing
alliance has been underestimated. Mr de Klerk's call for a 'landslide'
victory now looks optimistic. Senior government officials acknowledge
privately they would be relieved to get 55 per cent of votes.
But if the turnout among the 3.3m white voters is low, the right will insist
that the government has no mandate for the radical changes it has set in
train.
Violence continued to mar the campaign, with 12 people killed in
Johannesburg townships at the weekend. This brings to 250 the total killed
since the referendum was announced three weeks ago.
