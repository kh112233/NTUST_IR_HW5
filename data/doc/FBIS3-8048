<F P=106> [CTK report: "The Army Is Selling Arms, but It Is a Secret </F>
to Whom and for How Much"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Czech Army, which has the obligation to 
reduce its arsenal under international treaties, is either 
destroying its excess arms or selling them to Czech companies or 
abroad. 
  The Defense Ministry told MLADA FRONTA DNES that it had sold 
over 20,000 pistols through selected commercial firms last year, 
plus 13 combat planes, four armored vehicles, and two 
helicopters. 
  The ministry declined to provide details on where and for 
how 
much the technology was sold because that is a trade secret. 
According to Bretislav Gregr, director of the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade Licensing Administration, the technology that 
the Army sold is mostly nonfunctional. 
  The trading company Omnipol, for instance, sold two combat 
planes to Austria. They were a Soviet-made MiG 21-F and an L-29 
jet of domestic production. A MiG-15 from the Army arsenal was 
sold to Britain, and two OT-65 armored transporters from Army 
inventory were sold to the Netherlands. In all cases, the 
buyers were collectors--reportedly. 
  Omnipol also wanted to sell, from the Czech Army surplus, 
several thousand CZ-52 pistols to Canada and the United States. 
The deal did not materialize, however. 
  Two helicopters that were sold last year were bought by a 
domestic company, and the machines have not left the Czech 
Republic. 
  Apart from the military material that was sold, the Army has 
destroyed 583 combat armored vehicles, 28 aircraft, 606 tanks, 
and 621 artillery systems. Combat technology has been destroyed 
according to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe 
and the Vienna Treaty on Conventional Arms Reduction since 1992.
