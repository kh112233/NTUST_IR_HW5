  [Text] Johannesburg May 21 SAPA -- Lawyers for Winnie 
Mandela have warned her former friend and co-accused in the 
Stompie Seipei affair, Xoliswa Falati, to stop spreading new 
allegations about the deputy minister of arts, culture, science 
and technology. "You have caused, since your release in March 
from jail, to be published various newspaper articles containing 
false, defamatory and actionable allegations which clearly seek 
to undermine Mrs Mandela," her attorney Templeton Mageza said in 
a recent letter to Ms Falati. 
  CITY PRESS Editor Khulu Sibiya told SAPA on Saturday Ms 
Falati had informed his Sunday newspaper that she would hold an 
international press conference on Tuesday to disclose what she 
called more information about Mrs Mandela's part in atrocities. 
He quoted her as saying she was living in fear of her life and 
would not be cowed down by threats of legal action. 
  Mr Mageza said he had affidavits of people testifying to Ms 
Falati's allegations. "This letter serves to warn you that Mrs 
Mandela will not allow you to persist in your conduct." 
  On the planned international press conference, he told Ms 
Falati: "We are instructed to immediately proceed and approach 
the Supreme Court for the necessary relief. To avoid this 
drastic step we would advise that you furnish our offices by no 
later than noon on Monday, May 23, with an undertaking in 
writing that you will desist from further insulting, undermining 
and defaming of our client and that no such further publications 
shall be made by you and further that you will call no such 
press conference." 
  Mr Mageza stressed he was not trying to restrict anyone's 
freedom of speech, but said publications printing Ms Falati's 
allegations should verify them first. Mrs Mandela and Ms 
Falati, who were convicted in the trial of the kidnapping and 
murder of teenager Stompie Seipei, were respectively fined 
15,000 rand and imprisoned.
