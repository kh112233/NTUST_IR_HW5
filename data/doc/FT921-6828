FT  26 FEB 92 / UK Company News: SB breaches the Pounds 1bn barrier with 17%
rise
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals and consumer products
group, has broken the Pounds 1bn profits barrier for the first time.
Pre-tax profits increased 17 per cent from Pounds 860m to Pounds 1bn for the
year to December 31 1991.
The group's turnover fell 2 per cent from Pounds 4.76bn to Pounds 4.68bn
following disposals, adverse currency effects, and what Mr Robert Bauman,
chief executive, described as 'tough' trading conditions in the US consumer
market.
Nonetheless, overall revenues from continuing operations rose 4 per cent,
while trading profit increased 13 per cent.
Sales performance of established drugs was mixed: Tagamet, the anti-ulcer
product, fell 2 per cent to Pounds 620m; Dyazide fell 11 per cent to Pounds
148m; Amoxil, an antibiotic, increased 9 per cent to Pounds 243m. The
company was forced to offer Pounds 56m discounts in the US.
Among the newer products, Augmentin increased sales by 24 per cent to Pounds
504m and Seroxat, an anti-depressant, gained 10.7 per cent of the UK market
by value.
Clinical laboratories operations increased sales 13 per cent to Pounds 539m
and profits 24 per cent to Pounds 68m.
The animal health business achieved a 4 per cent increase in sales to Pounds
318m and a 9 per cent rise in trading profits to Pounds 63m.
Sales in the US consumer division fell 9 per cent as customers ran down
their stocks.
Mr Hugh Collum, finance director, announced the company wanted to split its
A and B shares on a 2-for-1 basis to increase liquidity and help smaller
shareholders.
The equity unit is also to be divided to comprise one split B share and a
reduced preferred share to make the A shares and the equity unit more easily
comparable.
The changes will be put to shareholders at the annual meeting in May.
Earnings per share increased 17 per cent from 41p to 48p and earnings per
equity unit from 205p to 240p. A quarterly dividend of 4.15p per A ordinary
share, equivalent to 48.49 cents per equity unit is declared.
COMMENT
SmithKline executives spent much of yesterday patting themselves on the back
for completing a highly successful merger in the space of little more than
two years. Their self-congratulations were justified, but the more difficult
task of generating organic growth remains before them. The most pressing
question is whether the new generation of drugs will be able to compensate
for those reaching or having reached the end of their patents. An increase
in pharmaceuticals sales of only 4 per cent is decidedly sedentary compared
with other companies and the outlook in Japan looks more than tricky with
further hefty price-cuts in the pipeline. On the upside, the stock is likely
to be less vulnerable to a move out of pharmaceutical companies into
cyclicals because of its consumer products division. Hoare Govett maintained
its profits forecast of Pounds 1.14bn for 1992.
