LOCAL; 
TRAIN HITS TRUCK IN SANTA ANA 
A furniture truck stalled on a railroad track this morning and was struck by a 
northbound train, splitting the vehicle in two and scattering furniture and 
boxes along 50 yards of track. 
No one was hurt. 
When they heard a train approaching, three workers on the truck ran down the 
tracks, trying to warn the engine crew, authorities said. 
"We ran up to the bridge and flagged down the train," said the driver, Joseph 
Alexander. He said the train operator "hit the brake" but could not stop in 
time. 
The accident occurred near Fairhaven and Grand avenues about 9 a.m., according 
to Santa Ana police.
