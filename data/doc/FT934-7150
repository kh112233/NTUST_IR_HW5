FT  20 NOV 93 / Why the FT knows its school tables - John Authers compares
the FT's league list with the government's survey - and finds some
interesting differences
IF YOU are a parent, you are probably suffering from statistical overload.
Barely a fortnight after the FT-1,000 survey, which identified the top
performing schools at A-level, the Department of Education this week weighed
in with an even more ambitious exercise - figures for every secondary school
in the country on GCSE, A-level, and vocational qualification pass rates,
along with a much criticised truancy league table.
Which survey is better?
The short answer is that the Government's survey is better at identifying
'problem schools'. Our survey is better at giving an accurate guide to the A
level performance of the top 1,000 schools. The response to our survey this
year was excellent, but, unlike the Government's, it cannot claim to be
comprehensive. The Government figures show that a small number of schools
which declined to take part in our survey could have made it into our top
1,000 list.
The main difference between the two surveys is that at A level, our data is
more detailed and the scoring system subtler. Our score gives equal weight
to the quality and quantity of A level achievements for a group of pupils,
whereas the Government focusses more narrowly on the quantity of A level
results achieved this year.
For this reason a league table based only on the government figures would
produce some absurd results. For example, Winchester College, Manchester
Grammar, and St Paul's Girls', come only 45th, 46th and 47th respectively on
the government's score, but much higher on ours. This is because at the best
schools, some pupils take one or more A levels a year early, and many of
them do not bother with General Studies at A level, a subject excluded from
our survey. However Government figures shed some interesting light on top
schools.
What evidence is there, for example, that GCSE performance is replicated at
A-level? No fewer than 46 schools with sixth forms managed to shepherd all
their 15-year-olds to five or more passes at a grade equivalent to the
old-fashioned O-level. Of these, the total variation in A-level points
(where an A equals 10 and an E equals 2) was from 37.4 by King Edward's
Birmingham, to 13.5 by the Atherley School in Southampton. The GCSE table
ranks the 25 top-performing GCSE schools according to their A level scores.
While the FT showed 23 state schools in the top 200 (up from three in 1992),
the government showed 48 in the top 200.
The government split all A-level candidates into those taking two or more
and those taking fewer than two. This will allow easier comparison with
tertiary and further education colleges. As many of these colleges
concentrate on vocational education, with students possibly only attempting
one A-level, comparison might otherwise be unfair. However, the division is
unhelpful when comparing schools devoted to academic qualifications.
A less important point is that the government included general studies in
its calculations, while the FT omitted it in the light of widespread
questioning of the qualification by academics and university admissions
tutors. However, its inclusion by the government allowed King Edward's and
King Edward VI High in Birmingham to shine with average A-level point scores
of 37.4 and 33.4 - both suggesting an average achievement better than three
grade As. Both schools excelled in the FT survey, but the government appears
to overstate their superiority.
Two other comments provoked by the FT's survey are important. One is that
some schools are claimed to try to improve their scores by rejecting
16-year-olds who will not do well. This is not likely to be popular with
parents in the private sector and state schools would find it difficult to
reject aspiring sixth formers with adequate qualifications.
Even so, it is interesting that Cherwell, the nation's third best
comprehensive at A level according to FT data, serving a plum academic
catchment area in north Oxford, recorded a distinctly mediocre performance
at GCSE. Only 58 per cent of its 15-year-olds passed five GCSEs at grades
from A to C. Some 193 comprehensive schools across the country managed to do
better.
Parents whose children might have difficulty getting as far as A level will
therefore want to look at more than just A level figures. Cherwell's figures
suggest that schools which get the most out of children above the age of 16
may not be so adept at nursing them through GCSE.
Allegations of deliberate 'pruning' of pupils by schools at 16 have led the
Conference for Independent Further Education, which includes mainly
'crammer' schools specialising in A-levels, to ensure that all their A-level
results are audited by external consultants.
There is also the question of size. The bigger a school, the harder it will
be to maintain a strong average across all pupils, unless it is highly
selective. However, parents of gifted children may prefer schools with a
large sixth form because of the likelihood that it will include a sizeable
nucleus of other similarly able pupils.
Therefore, it seems fair to say that schools with particularly large numbers
of A-level candidates deserve more credit than their bare statistical
averages suggest. Some very large schools, including Eton, Manchester
Grammar, and Haberdashers' Askes's, featured at the top of the table. Others
which might have been overlooked somewhat unfairly include Dulwich (69th,
with 186 entrants), Sevenoaks (89th with 215), Wellington (96th, with 178),
Marlborough (144th with 202) and Millfield (186th with 234 candidates).
Finally, the FT's method of calculation was more complex than the
government's. Each school's rank and position were produced by using the
UCAS points per pupil (PPP), measuring the quantity of grades obtained, and
the average number of UCAS points per subject entry (PPE), which measured
the quality of grades.
A school in which every pupil scored exactly three A grades would have an
average PPP of 30 and a PPE of 10. To give each figure approximately equal
weight, the PPE was multiplied by three before being added to the PPP. Our
final figures provided an index from which the rank positions were awarded.
We scaled this score for convenience so that the average for all the schools
in our sample was 1.0. A school with a score of 1.2, was thus 20 per cent
better than average.
