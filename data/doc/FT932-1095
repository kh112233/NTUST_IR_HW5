FT  25 JUN 93 / Eight charged with plot to blow up UN
EIGHT men believed to be Moslem fundamentalists were arrested yesterday on
charges of conspiring to blow up several sites including the United Nations
headquarters in New York, the FBI building and two road tunnels linking
Manhattan to New Jersey.
Mr James Fox, head of the FBI's New York office, said five of the men were
arrested in a bomb factory in Queens in the middle of mixing a 'witches
brew' of ingredients used in other bombings, including New York's World
Trade Centre.
The FBI would not comment on reports that the accused were planning to
assassinate, among others, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and New York Senator
Alphonse D'Amato, a Republican who advocates the death penalty for
terrorists.
The arrests come nearly four months after a bomb exploded at the World Trade
Centre, in the worst act of terrorism on US soil. Before the explosion,
which killed six people and injured 1,000, the US had been largely free from
acts of international terrorism.
Those arrested, five of whom are Sudanese resident in the US, are believed
to have ties to Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, the blind Egyptian preacher who
allegedly inspired the World Trade Centre bombers. The sheikh has condemned
the Trade Centre bombing and is appealing against a deportation order from
the US.
Mr Fox said there was 'no indication of foreign involvement' in the latest
plot, and added that the FBI had no plans to arrest the sheikh.
An FBI court filing describes a Mr Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali of Jersey City
as a central figure in the conspiracy. It alleges that he suggested
detonating a car bomb in the UN complex, and that he had taken part in a
test explosion before the Trade Centre bombing.
The trials of suspects in the World Trade Centre bombing are scheduled to
begin in September. The eight arrested yesterday face up to 15 years in
jail.
