ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
SOUTH COUNTY; 
FIRST INFRARED, THEN FANGS, THEN CAPTURE 
A fleeing suspect bit off more than he could chew -- or perhaps it was the 
other way around -- when he tried to fight off a police dog working with 
California Highway Patrol officers Thursday night. 
The 26-year-old suspect was taken to San Clemente General Hospital for 
treatment of dog bites on both thighs. 
The incident began at 6:47 p.m. when the CHP pursued a suspected drunk driver 
south on Interstate 5 in the Mission Viejo area, CHP Sgt. Dennis Dyer said. A 
check of the license plate indicated that the car was stolen. 
The suspect suddenly stopped in the freeway's center divider near Cristianitos 
Road and ran across the freeway lanes, almost getting hit, and into a large 
field near Camp Pendleton, he said. 
The CHP searched the field, assisted by helicopters from the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. A second helicopter from the Costa Mesa Police Department 
located the suspect by using infrared sensors that detected the suspect's body 
heat in the tall, dense brush, Dyer said. 
That's when Nick, a German shepherd police dog with the Sheriff's Department, 
was sent in. The suspect, identified as Fernandez Hernandez of Modesto, tried 
to fight off the dog. "He lost," Dyer said. 
Hernandez was arrested on suspicion of car theft and driving while intoxicated, 
Dyer said.
