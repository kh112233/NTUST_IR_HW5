Navy investigators probing the turret explosion aboard the battleship Iowa have 
apologized to a seaman for a news release that falsely implicated him in the 
disaster that killed 47 seamen, an attorney said. Gunner's Mate 3rd Class 
Kendall L. Truitt, 21, received the apology Wednesday from two Naval 
Investigative Service agents for a news leak that suggested Truitt was linked 
to the April 19 explosion, said Miami attorney Ellis Rubin. In a related 
development, ABC News reported that the NIS admitted that much of the 
information it leaked to reporters was false. Navy officials said they could 
not comment on the ABC report. "We now demand that the Navy officially clear 
Mr. Truitt and tell the public that he is not a homosexual nor was he involved 
in any murder-suicide pact that resulted in the explosion," Rubin said.
