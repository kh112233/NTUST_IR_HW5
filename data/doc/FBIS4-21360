  [Text] Geneva, March 22 (CNA) -- The chairman of the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) 
Standing Committee said Tuesday [22 March] that Taiwan has made 
substantial progress toward wildlife conservation but must 
continue crackdowns on trade in rhino horn and tiger parts. 
  Chairman Murray Hosking, speaking during a meeting of the 
CITES Standing Committee, noted that officials in Taiwan are 
taking wildlife conservation very seriously as evidenced by 
amendments to the Wildlife Conservation Law which significantly 
increase fines and penalties for violators and establishment of 
a wildlife protection unit. 
  He added that CITES was satisfied with the amendments to the 
law, but reserved final comment until an English-language 
translation of the bill is given to the CITES Secretariat. 
  Hosking also said CITES was satisfied that Taiwan is working 
to consolidate government stockpiles of endangered species 
products and has established a database for the registration, 
marking and sizing of confiscated stocks of rhino horn or tiger 
parts.
