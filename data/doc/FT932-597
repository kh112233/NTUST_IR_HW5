FT  28 JUN 93 / Letter: EBRD goals in danger of compromise
Sir, Regarding Robert Peston's European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development expose ('Top EBRD official accuses Attali of misleading him',
June 23): most of the original justification for the establishment of the
EBRD could have be compromised by Jacques Attali's apparently self-serving
effort to make the new group a World Bank clone, thereby perhaps saving his
job, while compromising his earlier stated goals for the bank.
Ernest Stern's record at the World Bank is intimately linked with failed
government-administered project lending. The World Bank's more recent
'structural adjustment lending' can be seen as a thinly veiled effort at
funding countries which would otherwise have to default on earlier failed
Bank project lending.
Mr Freeman, first vice-president of EBRD, is right to emphasise the new
bank's private-sector bias, only in those countries which respect the rule
of law and contract. It is this aspect which set the original EBRD apart
from the shopworn policies of the 'traditional development banks'. His
arguments must prevail in the EBRD director's deliberations.
