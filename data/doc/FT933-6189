FT  28 AUG 93 / Private schools improve A-levels
INDEPENDENT schools improved their A-level performance this year by 2.2 per
cent, according to figures from the Independent Schools Information Service,
John Authers writes.
Analysis by the Financial Times shows that the strongest results have again
come from big-city, single-sex day schools. Most of the top 20 schools have
shown remarkable consistency over the past six years.
St Paul's School in Barnes, south-west London, finished first. In terms of
the points system used to judge A-level results, its average score per pupil
was 29.4. A score of 30 would be equivalent to three A grades.
The highest-placed fully co-educational school was Leicester Grammar, at
29th.
