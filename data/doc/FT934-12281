FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: RJR Nabisco income falls 58%
RJR NABISCO, manufacturer of Winston and Camel cigarettes, yesterday
unveiled a 58 per cent drop in third-quarter net income.
The sharp decline reflects the impact of price wars with its main rival
Philip Morris, but Wall Street was prepared for the downturn and shares held
steady at Dollars 5 3/8 in early trading.
Net income in the quarter was Dollars 76m, including a one-time gain of
Dollars 2m on sales which fell 11 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn. A year earlier,
RJR earned Dollars 175m, including one-time charges of Dollars 70m, on sales
of Dollars 4bn.
RJR's earnings per share tumbled to 4 cents from 13 cents, while operating
income eased 44 per cent to Dollars 431m from Dollars 763m.
The company warned it would take significant charges in the fourth quarter
to cover cost-cutting and other performance improvement measures.
RJR had warned of a 43 per cent shortfall in operating income from US
tobacco operations for the whole of 1993 and the third-quarter results were
exactly as most analysts had predicted.
Mr Charles Harper, chairman and chief executive, said the company's earnings
showed the direct impact of lower tobacco prices in the US.
Stripping out domestic tobacco results, RJR's third-quarter operating income
from continuing businesses rose 15 per cent.
Overall, the group's tobacco business posted sales of Dollars 1.87bn, down
20 per cent from the Dollars 2.33bn reported in the same period of last
year.
Operating income before amortisation of trademarks and goodwill dropped 46
per cent to Dollars 382m from Dollars 712m.
Internationally, operating income before amortisation of trademarks and
goodwill rose 14 per cent on sales which edged 2 per cent higher.
Gains overseas were more than offset by a 64 per cent plunge in domestic
operating income before amortisation of trademarks and goodwill.
US sales fell 29 per cent. The company blamed a less favourable product mix
and lower overall volume for the erosion, in addition to discounted prices.
The company's food group saw sales rise 6 per cent to Dollars 1.73bn and
operating income for continuing businesses before amortisation of trademarks
and goodwill advance 10 per cent to Dollars 230m.
For the first nine months, RJR earned Dollars 316m, or 23 cents a share,
against Dollars 254m, or 20 cents a year earlier. There were one-time
charges of Dollars 110m in the 1993 period and charges of Dollars 351m in
the same period of 1992.
Sales eased to Dollars 11.1bn from Dollars 11.65bn.
