FT  12 SEP 94 / Fiat weighs up Mexico venture
Fiat of Italy is planning to begin car assembly in Mexico and is negotiating
a joint venture with Dina, the leading Mexican truck and bus maker, with the
aim of producing up to 100,000 cars a year. Mexico is attracting a growing
number of the world's leading car makers in the wake of last year's North
American Free Trade Agreement. The Mexican car industry is dominated by
Volkswagen of Germany and Nissan of Japan along with the big three US
producers, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
Fiat said it was planning to produce its Uno small car range for sale in the
Mexican market and in some Central American and Caribbean markets. Fiat is
already well established in South America, with car production in Brazil,
Argentina and Venezuela. It had a 24 per cent share of the Brazilian market
last year and 30 per cent in Argentina. Fiat said it planned to supply
components, such as engines and gearboxes, for the Mexican operation from
its existing facilities in South America. It insisted it had no plans to use
a Mexican production base to re-enter the US market, from which it withdrew
the Fiat brand in 1983.
