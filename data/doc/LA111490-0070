SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE 
The supervisors Tuesday allocated $80,000 to improve security at the family law 
courts at the Vista Court Annex and El Cajon Regional Center. 
The airport-type security equipment, including an X-ray machine and 
walk-through magnetometer, will be installed within the next few months. 
The security systems are designed to detect weapons and other contraband. All 
people entering the courtrooms will be screened. Marshal's officers will 
operate the equipment. 
Supervisors expressed concern that security needed to be improved at the two 
facilities in light of the number of weapons being confiscated at the family 
law court and juvenile court lobby in downtown San Diego. 
Family law courts, which handle divorces and child custody, and Juvenile Court, 
which handles gang-related matters, are the most volatile areas of the local 
justice system, said San Diego County Marshal Michael Sgobba. 
Since the airport-type security station was put up in 1987 at the family law 
court downtown, the marshal's office has confiscated 4,469 knives, razors and 
other cutting weapons, 110 handguns, 126 Mace containers, 34 stun guns, 17 
blackjacks, 702 miscellaneous weapons such as hatchets, and ammunition, drugs 
and alcohol.
