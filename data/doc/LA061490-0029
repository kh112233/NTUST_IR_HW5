WORLD IN BRIEF; 
COLOMBIA; 
TWO MORE OFFICERS SLAIN IN MEDELLIN 
Gunmen in the cocaine capital of Medellin sprayed a patrol car with bullets, 
killing two officers and wounding two others. 
The four were going off duty after guarding the house of the provincial police 
director. The murders brought to 127 the number of officers killed in the city 
this year. Shortly afterward, the "Extraditables" -- top traffickers wanted for 
trial in the United States -- renewed their declaration of war on the 
government in an open letter to the police director.
