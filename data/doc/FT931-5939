FT  03 MAR 93 / Sharp rise in asylum seekers
THE number of asylum seekers arriving in Germany reached more than 38,000 in
February, a mid-winter record, with a sharp increase in the number coming
from Romania.
In spite of strenuous efforts by German border police to stem the flow of
would-be immigrants from eastern Europe, the latest statistics show an
increase of 20 per cent in the first two months of the year, compared with
the same period in 1992.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the German interior minister, said the latest figures
provided confirmation of the need for urgent changes in the country's
liberal asylum law, currently delayed in parliamentary procedures.
He also released figures showing that of 34,505 applications for asylum
processed in the course of February, only 539, or 1.6 per cent, were
granted. Of the remainder, 68 per cent were rejected as economic migrants,
not political refugees, and 30 per cent withdrawn.
In the February figures for asylum-seekers, no fewer than 45 per cent came
from Romania and Bulgaria - 12,853 from Romania, compared with only 3,760 a
year ago. In contrast, there was a 45 per cent fall in the number from
former Yugoslavia: 5,637 this year, compared with 12,540 last February.
