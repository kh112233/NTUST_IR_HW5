  [Text] Wednesday night's [9 March] IRA mortar attack on 
Heathrow should cause little surprise. It had already become 
apparent that no consensus to support the peace process existed 
within Sinn Fein. It matters little whether the Heathrow 
operation was centrally directed by the IRA Army Council or 
launched by one of the independent cells in which the terrorists 
now operate, for security reasons. The consequence was to send 
a message to the world that, for the Provisionals, it is 
business as usual, and a minute or two either way with this 
particular business could have cost a planeload of passengers 
their lives. 
  We have urged the British and Irish governments not to allow 
Sinn Fein to make political capital out of its prevarications 
towards the Downing Street Declaration. Now, the two 
governments have no excuse for waiting any longer, and should 
act speedily to regain the initiative. They should increase 
military activity against the IRA by intensifying co-operation 
between their security forces -- if Dublin possesses the 
political will to do its part. Equally important, they should 
step up the political pressure on Sinn Fein. 
  The government in Dublin and John Hume's SDLP [Social 
Democratic Labour Party] have expended much effort on wooing 
Republican opinion, but they have failed to show matching 
sensitivity towards Unionist concerns, or towards fostering 
local political progress within Ulster. The Declaration will 
plainly remain on the table as the basis on which Sinn Fein can 
enter the political scene if it ever becomes willing to renounce 
violence. But, if Dublin and the SDLP intend to pursue the 
objectives of the Declaration with anything more useful than 
rhetoric, they should make common cause against Sinn Fein with 
the British Government and the Unionists.
