GENETIC TRAIL MAY PUT PANTHERS AT RISK 
A new genetic study shows most of the 30 to 50 endangered panthers in the 
Everglades are not purebred Florida panthers at all, but hybrids that may not 
be entitled to protection under the Endangered Species Act. Scientists compared 
the panthers' cells and found two distinct families. One was apparently 
descended from South American pumas set free in the 1950s.
