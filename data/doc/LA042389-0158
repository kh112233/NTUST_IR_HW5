A new Gallup Poll finds as much support for an increase in the budget for 
Social Security (46%) as for maintaining the current spending level (47%) and 
very little backing (3%) for a decrease. Government programs for the elderly 
are similarly endorsed: 50% favor an increase, 45% would maintain the status 
quo and 3% favor cuts, the survey found. Fifty-six percent would oppose raising 
taxes on Social Security payments to the same rate as taxes on ordinary income, 
while the same percentage of respondents oppose limiting the amount Medicare 
pays for the elderly's annual health care bills. Almost as many (45%) are 
opposed to reducing cost-of-living increases for those on Social Security.
