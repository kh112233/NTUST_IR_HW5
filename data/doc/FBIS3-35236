  [Text] We begin our international news from Tripoli: Libya 
today considered an immediate withdrawal of its forces stationed 
in the Aozou strip, disputed with Chad, as out of the question. 
This came after the International Court of Justice announced 
its ruling according Chad full sovereignty over the strip. 
  Press sources have said that Libya might demand the 
settlement of the question of its lost soldiers in the area with 
Washington as a condition before announcing its final position 
regarding withdrawal from the Aozou strip, which is considered 
by experts to be rich in oil and uranium.
