  [Text] La Paz, 21 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Although the 
existence of "a drug cartel" in Oruro Department has been ruled 
out, National Social Defense Secretariat officials conceded here 
today (21 May) that narcotrafficking activities and the 
smuggling of chemical precursors have increased markedly in the 
Republic's western region. 
  Victor Hugo Canelas, the under secretary for controlled 
substances, told LOS TIEMPOS that Oruro has in recent years 
become more of a "corridor for the drug trade" in light of its 
proximity to Chilean regions bordering Bolivia. 
  Canelas said the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) 
intelligence division has long identified the existence of 
"organized rings for drug trafficking" and groups having their 
"epicenter for action" and headquarters in the "red Chapare 
region of Cochabamba Department." 
  Canelas stated: "As a rule, drug traffickers operating in 
our country have close contacts in Chapare and in other major 
centers of the western region and the Bolivian Amazon region."
