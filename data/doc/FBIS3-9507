<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "International Committee for Arrested </F>
Albanians"] 
  [Text] The Party for Democratic Prosperity [PDP] issued a 
public announcement saying the occasional actualising of the 
so-called "arms affair" is a continuation of attempts to 
publicly discredit PDP, its parliament group, and the Albanian 
ministers in the government, thus presenting them before the 
international community as ultranationalists, terrorists, and 
forces intending to introduce instability in Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. All this is 
done by some government bodies in collaboration with other 
forces from abroad. 
  The more frequent one-sided and false presentation of PDP's 
activities and its political mechanism in part of the Macedonian 
media is just a part of such a propaganda. 
  In order to completely clarify certain dilemmas about the 
involvement of some political figures in the so-called "arms 
affair," PDP will request from authorised international 
institutions to form an international committee to deal with the 
case.
