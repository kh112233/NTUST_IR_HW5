QUEBEC POLICEMAN KILLED IN GUN BATTLE ON MOHAWK LAND 
Masked Mohawks struggling to prevent ancestral land from being turned into a 
golf course killed a police officer today during a fierce gun battle with 
Quebec police. 
The battle began early in the morning after about 100 riot-equipped Quebec 
police officers stormed an illegal barricade set up by the Mohawks on a hilltop 
just outside Oka, a small town 20 miles west of Montreal. 
Cpl. Marcel Lemay, 31, was pronounced dead a short time later at a Montreal 
hospital where he was taken after being shot in the face. 
Several Mohawks reported that they had taken a police sniper hostage, but the 
reports were later denied.
