  [Text] Citing information received from Chechnya and a 
statement by the Georgian ex-president's wife, Manana Archvadze, 
international media reported that the former president of 
Georgia committed suicide in a village of Zugdidi Rayon on 5 
January. However, the official authorities and appropriate 
bodies in Zugdidi, Tsalenjikha, and adjacent rayons do not 
possess such information. 
  A high-ranking officer in the Georgian Security Ministry 
believes that the information about Gamsakhurdia's suicide must 
be thoroughly checked. One of the high-ranking officers in the 
Georgian Security Ministry who did not want to reveal his 
identity stated that the information about the Georgian 
ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia's suicide in a populated 
location in western Georgia on 31 December was based only on 
rumors and must therefore be thoroughly checked. 
  In an interview with INTERFAX, the officer said that three 
days ago Security Ministry officials in Zugdidi got hold of 
leaflets carrying Zviad Gamsakhurdia's address to the Georgian 
people in which he urged them not to surrender and to continue 
the struggle against the Shevardnadze junta. 
  The officer also believes that Zviad Gamsakhurdia is not a 
man capable of committing suicide. 
  There are also other versions. According to reports from the 
IPRINDA agency, a split occurred over the new year among the 
former president's supporters in Chechnya. It developed into an 
armed clash, as a result of which Zviad Gamsakhurdia was wounded 
and died several days later. 
  The Georgian leadership does not possess information to 
confirm or deny these reports. However, since there are such 
reports, the republic's Prosecutor's Office and other competent 
bodies have been entrusted with the task of carrying out an 
investigation. The public will be informed about its results. 
  In connection with this incident, Chechen Vice President 
(Zelimkhan Yantardiyev), Foreign Minister (Shamsudin Yusip), and 
the president's adviser arrived in Tbilisi today, 5 January.
