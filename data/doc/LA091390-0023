MORNING REPORT: ART 
Faux Pas: Art thieves who thought they swiped a museum-quality collection last 
week in Cannes, France, are probably mourning the one that got away, police 
said Wednesday. Collector Jacques Schwarz-Fuchs told authorities that at least 
eight of the stolen works are copies of paintings by Pablo Picasso, Pierre 
Auguste Renoir and other 19th- and 20th-Century artists. But the thieves left 
an original Camille Pissarro that probably was worth more than all the stolen 
items together, police said. BETH KLEID
