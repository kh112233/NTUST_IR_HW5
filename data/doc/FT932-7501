FT  22 MAY 93 / Angolan peace talks collapse
MARATHON Angolan peace talks have collapsed after the government and Unita
rebels failed to agree on a draft peace package, raising fears that the
civil war may intensify, Reuter reports from Abidjan.
A final session of the six-week-old talks in Ivory Coast broke up without
success last night and participants said negotiations were suspended
indefinitely.
'I'm afraid the war is going to go on and probably to intensify,' Ms
Margaret Anstee, the United Nations special envoy to Angola, said in the
Ivorian capital Abidjan. 'That means we have to intensify our efforts to try
to get the two sides together again.' There was no indication if talks
between Unita and the MPLA government would restart.
Ms Anstee said the main stumbling-block was a military clause in the draft
peace agreement saying Unita fighters would withdraw from areas they have
occupied since late last year. The MPLA said it was ready to sign the peace
package, drawn up by observers from Portugal, Russia and the US. Unita
refused.
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday announced US recognition of the
formerly-Marxist MPLA, effectively ending 18 years of support for Unita.
In Angola, fighting continued. The government said yesterday 40 civilians
were killed and 51 wounded during a Unita raid on the besieged eastern city
of Luena.
