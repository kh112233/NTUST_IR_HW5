TAX INCREASE: DEBATE OVER WHO WILL PAY 
It's high time that serious consideration is now being given to raising taxes. 
Those people who would also cut entitlements, however, must think that some of 
us live on another planet! We who receive Social Security or federal annuities 
live here and spend money, too. We would end up paying twice. Not only will our 
tax payments go up but our incomes would go down. To be fair, taxes should be 
raised but entitlements should be left alone.
