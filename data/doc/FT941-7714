FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japanese drugs group climbs 4%
Kyowa Hakko, the Japanese chemicals and drugs group, yesterday reported
pre-tax profits up 4.5 per cent at Y17bn (Dollars 160m). The results were
achieved on sales down 0.6 per cent at Y294bn.
Mr Katuji Kuwabara, managing director, said a substantial sales decline in
chemicals had been more than offset by a robust performance from the
pharmaceuticals, alcohol and food operations. The company reported post-tax
profits up 4.1 per cent at Y6.28bn.
The group predicted pre-tax profits this financial year would be almost flat
at Y17bn on sales up 2.9 per cent at Y303bn. It reckoned operating profits
would be unchanged at Y18.5bn and post-tax profits Y6.3bn.
The company, which is Japan's ninth largest drugs group, said the cuts in
domestic drugs prices due to be implemented in April would reduce its sales
by about Y5bn. Chemical prices were likely to remain low, even if sales
increased, it added. The company said it would raise its research and
development spending by Y1.2bn to Y19.1bn this year.
Meanwhile, Chugai, one of Japan's fastest growing drugs groups, yesterday
warned its sales and profits would slow rapidly this year because of the
government measures to reduce drugs spending.
The company's healthcare sales fell 4.5 per cent last year to Y27.2bn, while
pesticide sales were up 24.8 per cent to Y608m. Overseas sales rose 11.4 per
cent to Y6.4bn.
The group said pre-tax profits would grow only 2.8 per cent this year to
Y17.5bn, compared with a 16.2 per cent increase last year.
Sales would grow only 4.3 per cent to Y158bn, compared with a rise of 5.7
per cent in 1993.
