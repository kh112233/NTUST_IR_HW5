The brother of NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue was one of four journalists shot 
and wounded in Timisoara, Romania, while covering the fierce fighting between 
revolutionaries and forces loyal to deposed President Nicolae Ceausescu. 
John Tagliabue of the New York Times was one of three journalists wounded in 
separate incidents while driving in cars. 
All were expected to survive. 
Tagliabue was wounded in the back by a sniper who fired on a car carrying him 
and other reporters, said Bernard Gwertzman, foreign editor of the New York 
Times.
