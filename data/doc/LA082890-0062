METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 COLOMBIANS CHARGED IN SEIZURE OF COCAINE 
Three Colombians were charged Monday with conspiracy and narcotics possession 
in the seizure of more than 600 pounds of cocaine valued at $106 million found 
buried beneath laundry soap in barrels being unloaded from a truck, prosecutors 
said. 
Javier Ospina, 27; Diego Ocampo Lopez, 33, and Horacio Aceves, 35, were charged 
by the district attorney's office with one count each of conspiracy, possession 
of cocaine for sale and transportation of cocaine. 
Prosecutors said they would seek bail of $5 million each. 
The defendants were arrested Aug. 23 after Los Angeles and South Gate police, 
who had two of the suspects under surveillance, watched them meet the third 
defendant at an apartment on Alvarado Street, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lonnie Felker 
said. The defendants got into a truck and tried to outrun the police, then 
began unloading drums outside an auto repair shop on Alvarado, Felker said. 
Police, suspecting that the drums contained drugs, brought in drug-sniffing 
dogs.
