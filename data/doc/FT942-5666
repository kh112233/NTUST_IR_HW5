FT  03 JUN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Non-pollutant leak detector
A new method of detecting leaks in gas-assisted (to keep out moisture)
electric power and telecommunications cables without using pollutants has
been developed by Varian of Italy.
The system, marketed by Ai Cambridge, uses helium; an instrument sensitive
to the gas provides highly accurate readings, eliminating errors from other
soil-borne gases. Previously, some 60 per cent of tests were abandoned
because of false readings.
The system dispenses with arcton, a CFC compound gas known to cause damage
to the ozone layer. Norweb, a UK electricity company using the
helium-sensing technique, has withdrawn approval for the arcton method. 'We
are now obtaining 100 per cent success in locating leaks in our gas-filled
cables,' says Alan Jones, Norweb's Manchester area maintenance manager.
