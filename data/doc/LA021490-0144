TROOP AGREEMENT REMOVES ARMS PACT OBSTACLE -- BUSH 
President Bush today called Soviet acceptance of his troop cut proposal for 
Europe "an important breakthrough" that removes a major obstacle to a 
conventional arms treaty. 
Bush, before signing a Panama aid bill, praised Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev for accepting his plan to allow the U.S. and Soviet armies to keep 
195,000 troops each in Central Europe, with the United States allowed to 
station 30,000 more troops in Britain, Italy, Turkey, Greece and Spain. 
"This is an important breakthrough which removes a major obstacle to the early 
conclusion of a CFE (conventional forces in Europe) treaty, and it also 
established the principle that U.S. forces in Europe are not to be treated as 
equivalent to Soviet forces in Eastern Europe," said Bush. 
He also hailed a separate agreement to speed German reunification. The four 
powers that defeated Hitler in World War II have agreed to meet with leaders of 
the two Germanys to lay the groundwork for unification. 
Bush, who had said Monday that it was too early for a four powers' meeting on 
the future of Germany, acknowledged he was caught by surprise at the speed at 
which the German unification question has moved forward. 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who helped negotiate the latest 
breakthroughs in meetings in Ottawa with foreign secretaries from both NATO and 
Warsaw Pact nations, was at the President's side. 
"We and our German allies are in full accord," Bush said. "Things move quite 
fast there." 
The foreign ministers of the two German states will meet with the foreign 
ministers of the four powers -- the United States, Great Britain, France and 
the Soviet Union -- "to discuss the external aspects of the establishment of 
German unity," Bush said. 
"This brings us a step closer to realizing the longstanding goal of German 
unity," said Bush, who has insisted that a united Germany must belong to NATO.
