YOUNG HELD TO FARE WELL AFTER ABORTION 
Black urban teen-agers who have abortions fare better economically and are more 
apt to stay in school than peers who become young mothers, a new study reports. 
The study, published by the nonprofit Alan Guttmacher Institute in Manhattan, 
researched 334 unmarried black teens aged 17 or younger from similar economic 
backgrounds who visited two Baltimore health clinics for pregnancy tests in 
1985 and 1986. Researchers found that 82% of the women who had abortions 
graduated from high school or remained in school two years after the procedure 
without having fallen behind, while only 63% of the women who gave birth 
completed high school or were still in school two years later.
