<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Abel Abraao in Cuito] </F>
  [Text] Until early this evening an unspecified number of 
civilians had been killed and 47 wounded since the start of the 
shellings this morning. Snipers fired at residents throughout 
the day as they ventured into the streets to search for food, 
water, and firewood. The situation in Cuito could be described 
as critical. Unable to challenge government forces, Jonas 
Savimbi's men fire shells into the city and at civilians. The 
latter have gone without food and medicines since emergency 
relief operations have been discontinued. The number of people 
killed as a result of the shellings is on the increase. A 
civilian died of starvation at (Cangota) Ward this afternoon. 
Should the relief program not resume soon, more people are 
likely to die of starvation.
