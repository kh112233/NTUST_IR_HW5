<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The invention listed below is owned by an agency of the U.S. Government and is available for licensing in the U.S. in
accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 to achieve expeditious commercialization of results of federally funded research
and development.






U.S. Patent Application Number 08/129,294, filed September 24, 1993, and entitled ``Ultrasonic Dynamic Vector
Stress Measurement Method and Sensor''_The present invention relates in general to dynamic stress measurement
when a material is put under a load and more particularly to a method and apparatus for measuring changes in stress via
a pulsed phase locked loop technique.


A stress measurement method and sensor according to the invention consists of directly and dynamically measuring
stress changes at the location touched by a probe device when a material or structure is placed under a load. Electronics
employing a pulsed phase locked loop (P2L2) technology are coupled to a probe system which is placed in contact with
a material under stress. A gated signal from the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO), a free running oscillator on
all the time, drives the transducer exciter at the transmitter and causes an acoustic wave to be propagated across
a sample under stress. The VCO also sends a reference signal to the mixer. The output of the mixer represents the phase
difference of the reference and propagated signals and serves as a feedback signal to the VCO. This phase difference
tracks the changes in stress in the sample. The P2L2 reacts to the change in stress by changing its operating frequency
according to a specified relationship. The AC component of the feedback signal represents the change in voltage needed
to keep the system in quadrature to follow the change in stress. This signal is extracted for amplitude calibration.
Calibration is accomplished by placing the probe on a plate of similar propagation factors and a known cyclic change
in applied stress. The resulting AC signal multiplied by a calibration factor is equal to the stress.

The invention claimed in this patent application is available for licensing on an exclusive, partially exclusive
or nonexclusive basis for upfront, running and annual minimum royalty payments to a partner committed to commercializing
this technology.
