  [Text] Hanoi, May 12 KYODO -- China has increased its naval 
presence in the area of the disputed Spratly Islands in the 
South China Sea, Vietnamese Government sources said Thursday. 
The sources, including officials of the Vietnamese Foreign 
Ministry, said the number of Chinese naval vessels dispatched to 
the area has increased amid heightening tension between the two 
countries over the issue of oil concessions. 
  Some sources, including a diplomat of one of the members of 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), suggested a 
military conflict could break out depending on how Vietnam 
reacts to the latest Chinese moves. 
  Chinese ships in the area are said to number eight, 
including 
at least one frigate and two research ships, as well as landing 
craft, torpedo boats and data collection vessels. 
  Unconfirmed reports are circulating to the effect that 
Vietnam has rushed its own naval vessels to the area. 
  Hanoi is said to have stationed Navy ships on a regular 
basis 
at an ostensible fishing port facility that it built last year 
on one of the Spratly Islands. 
  The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday Vietnam holds 
sole rights to exploit natural resources in the Tuchinh and 
Thanhlong (Blue Dragon) areas in the South China Sea. 
  China on Thursday criticized Vietnam's contract with U.S. 
oil 
company Mobil Corp. and Japanese partners to explore the area as 
"illegal" and a violation of Beijing's sovereignty but said the 
dispute should be resolved peacefully. Beijing claims 
"irrevocable sovereignty" over the entire area around the 
Spratly Islands, including the adjacent area where Mobil has 
said it would continue with offshore oil exploration work. 
  The Spratly Islands are also claimed by Vietnam, Taiwan, the 
Philippines, Brunei and Malaysia.
