FT  25 MAY 94 / Trade Centre bombers jailed for 240 years
Four Moslem fundamentalists convicted of bombing the World Trade Centre were
each sentenced yesterday to 240 years in prison by a judge who called them
sneaks and cowards, Reuter rports from New York.
US District Judge Kevin Duffy said 180 years of each sentence against Ahmad
Ajaj, Mohammad Salameh, Nidal Ayyad and Mahmud Abouhalima was based on life
expectancy of six people who died in the blast.
The February 26 1993 car bomb injured over 1,000 people and caused hundreds
of millions of dollars worth of damage. The fatal blast shocked the nation
with the realisation that the US was no longer safe from such violence.
The defendants were convicted on March 4 by a Manhattan federal jury of
conspiracy resulting in death and destruction.
