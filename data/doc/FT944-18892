FT  01 OCT 94 / Channel tunnel's car shuttle launched
Eurotunnel yesterday launched the flagship shuttle service with which it
hopes to win half of the cross-Channel car passenger market by the end of
1996.
Car shuttles carrying staff, journalists and the winners of a Eurotunnel
travel competition made the 35-minute journey in the twin-deck,
air-conditioned shuttle trains.
On Monday, nearly 18 months later than originally planned, Eurotunnel will
start its Overture service with a trip for invited shareholders, bankers,
MPs and MEPs. It hopes to carry 60,000 passengers and 20,000 cars in the six
weeks of the introductory service.
The company has already received applications from more than 10,000 of its
UK shareholders alone and requests are arriving in their thousands every
day, Mr Christopher Garnett, commercial director, said. Shareholders, who
will be expected to pay Pounds 30 to cover administration costs, will be
selected by ballot.
The final price of tickets will not be announced until mid-November when
Eurotunnel plans a full service for car passengers.
Eurotunnel announced car shuttle fares in January when it expected to start
services in May. They ranged from Pounds 125 for a two-day return fare to
Pounds 310 for journeys on peak midsummer weekends. It withdrew these fares,
regarded as being quite high, when the launch was delayed.
Car passengers are expected to remain with their vehicles during the
crossing although they can move around on the narrow aisles beside their
cars.
Each of the almost half-mile-long shuttle trains can carry up to 180 cars or
120 cars and 12 coaches. Eurotunnel is beginning with one car shuttle an
hour but this will rise to four an hour when it is operating at full
capacity.
The blocked drainage pipes which led to the build up of water and disrupted
signalling in the tunnel may have to be replaced if they cannot be cleared,
Eurotunnel said. 'This is possibly a design fault,' Mr John Noulton, public
affairs director said.
