FROZEN EMBRYO CUSTODY TRIAL STARTS 
The trial in an unprecedented custody battle over seven frozen embryos opened 
today with lawyers debating whether the mother has the right to bear the 
"test-tube babies" against the father's wishes. 
Mary Sue Davis, 28, contends that the embryos created through in vitro 
fertilization are "pre-born children" and she wants the right to have them 
implanted in her womb. Her estranged husband, Junior Davis, 30, argues that use 
of the fertilized eggs held in frozen storage would force him into unwanted 
fatherhood. 
Davis won a temporary court order against his wife's use of the eggs after 
filing for divorce in February to end their nine-year marriage. He told 
reporters that he does not want his children to suffer the pain of a broken 
home.
