DESCRIPTION OF PERMIT MODIFICATION REQUESTED:

 The Foundation issued a permit (95004) to Dr. Wayne Z. Trivelpiece on September 7, 1994. The issued permit allows
for the capture of various penguin and seabird species, within the borders of SSSI

#

weighing, measuring, marking with dyes, stomach pumping and the attachment of radio transmitters and time-depth
recorders. All birds will be released on site after capture.



The permit holder requests to modify the permit to allow for the collection of 1 ml samples of blood each from 20 breeding
Adelie penguins at the current study site in SSSI

#

8 and 20 breeding Adelies in the Palmer Station vicinity. The samples will be used to determine a possible genetic difference
between the two distinct populations of Adelies in the Peninsula region based on the ``gap'' in their distributions
between King George Island and Anvers Island.
