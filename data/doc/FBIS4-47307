  [Abstract] In developing thermonuclear targets with a 
positive energy yield it is customary to examine a case when the 
deuterium and tritium are present in the target in a condensed 
state. Such targets are used in laser thermonuclear fusion 
experiments at the Iskra-4 and Iskra-5 facilities. The material 
used for the coatings is liquid and solid deuterium or a 
deuterium-tritium mixture, as well as beryllium and titanium 
hydrides and polyethylene containing deuterium and tritium. An 
annotated diagram of the cryogenic unit for preparing a target 
in the interaction chamber is given. The technology for 
preparing cryogenic targets and their installation in the 
interaction chamber is fully explained in the text. This 
technology is similar to that developed in the United States 
(such as D. L. Musinski, et al., APPL. PHYS. LETTS, 34, 300, 
1979). The method makes it possible to obtain a cryogenic target 
100-300 m in diameter and 0.5-2 m thick. Details of the 
method are given. For example, the behavior of the cryolayer was 
registered by a motion picture survey of the shadow pattern or 
interferogram; holographic interferometry was used for more 
precise measurements of the thickness and uniformity of the 
cryolayer. Additional information is given on the procedures for 
controlling and monitoring the parameters and behavior of the 
layer. Figures 7; references 15: 13 Russian, 2 Western.
