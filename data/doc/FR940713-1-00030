 



Note: 

All establishments shall develop and maintain a permanent marking system that identifies carcasses with removable
lesions/conditions on the inside surfaces. When removable lesions/conditions are identified inside the carcass
by the establishment sorter, the sorter will apply the permanent mark. When removable inside lesions/conditions
are found on a subgroup sample without the permanent mark, the error is not recorded. The affected carcass(es) will
be hung back for IIC disposition and corrective action.

(i) 

Partial quality control program.

 (1) Any owner or operator of an official establishment preparing poultry products who wishes to operate under an approved
PQC program must submit to the Administrator a partial quality control program designed to assure that poultry is
wholesome and properly prepared and shall request a determination as to whether or not that program is adequate to
result in product being in compliance with the requirements of the Act and therefore qualify for the higher inspection
rates specified in 381.67.

(2) The approved quality control program for the establishment shall include control points on the line, which shall
be monitored by the inspector.

(3) Establishment quality control employees shall operate the poultry carcass on-line quality control program
and shall make immediately available to inspection personnel any and all data collected and maintained under the
approved partial quality control program.

(4) An inspector shall monitor the establishment's application of the poultry carcass on-line quality control program
and shall take corrective action when he or she determines that the establishment has failed to maintain or correct
its process as described in the approved quality control program.

(5) The application, evaluation, and termination procedures for a PQC program are prescribed in 381.145.
If approval of the PQC program has been terminated in accordance with the provisions of 381.145(g), an application
and request for approval of the same or modified quality control program will not be evaluated by the Administrator
for at least 2 months from the termination date. In order for the Department to provide the Federal inspection required
under the Act, an establishment whose PQC program has been terminated will be allowed to continue operating at maximum
inspection rates for establishments without PQC programs as prescribed in 381.67, provided all requirements
of the Act and regulations thereunder are met.

7. Section 381.91 would be amended by revising the last sentence of paragraph (b)(1), by redesignating paragraph
(b)(2) as paragraph (b)(3), and by adding a new paragraph (b)(2) to read as follows:



381.91

Contamination.



* * * * *



(b)(1) *** All visible specks of contamination must be removed, and, if the inner surfaces are reprocessed
other than solely by trimming, all surfaces of the carcass shall be treated with chlorinated water containing 20 ppm
available chlorine or with any compound that is approved for poultry processing by the Food and Drug Administration
and listed in title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, chapter I.

(2) When reprocessing carcasses, the establishment shall:

(i) Identify all reprocessed carcasses by lot in a manner acceptable to the inspector in charge,

(ii) Return each reprocessed lot to the processing line at a location after viscera harvest and before the on-line/off-line
carcass inspector for reinspection, and

(iii) Comply with the general chilling time and temperature requirements prescribed in 381.66(b)(2).
