<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of (1) a new bulk form of cefotetan,
cefotetan, and (2) for its use in a new dosage form of cefotetan sodium, cefotetan sodium injection. The agency has
concluded that the data supplied by the manufacturer concerning this antibiotic drug are adequate to establish its
safety and efficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR part 442
to provide for the inclusion of accepted standards for this product.


Environmental Impact


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


Submitting Comments and Filing Objections


This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because
this final rule is not controversial and because, when effective, it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds
that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective
June 24, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before June 24, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable
grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before June 24, 1994,
a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before July 25, 1994, the data, information,
and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing
may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and
substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information,
and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action
taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the
Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making
findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the
docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.
The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission
of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained
in 21 CFR 314.300.
All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C.
331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.

(b) 

Tests and methods of assay

_(1) 

Potency

. Proceed as directed in 436.216 of this chapter, except use the resolution test solution to determine resolution
in lieu of the working standard solution. Perform the assay at ambient temperature, using an ultraviolet detection
system operating at a wavelength of 254 nanometers, a column packed with microparticulate (3 to 10 micrometers in
diameter) reversed phase packing material such as octadecyl hydrocarbon bonded silicas, a flow rate not exceeding
2.0 milliliters per minute, and a known injection volume of between 10 and 20 microliters. Reagents, working standard
solution, sample solution, resolution test solution, system suitability requirements, and calculations are as
follows:
(i) 

 Reagents

_(A) 

Diluting solution

. Mix water:methanol:acetonitrile (90:5:5).
(B) 

Mobile phase

. Mix 0.1

M

 phosphoric acid:glacial acetic acid:methanol:acetonitrile (1700:100:105:105). Filter through a suitable filter
capable of removing particulate matter greater than 0.5 micron in diameter. Degas the mobile phase just prior to its
introduction into the chromatograph.
(ii) 

 Preparation of working standard, sample, and resolution test solutions

_(A) 

Working standard solution

. Accurately weigh approximately 50 milligrams of the cefotetan working standard into a 250-milliliter volumetric
flask containing 12.5 milliliters of methanol. Swirl the flask for several minutes, then add 12.5 milliliters of
acetonitrile. Swirl the flask until the cefotetan is dissolved. Dilute to volume with water to obtain a solution containing
approximately 200 micrograms of cefotetan per milliliter. Mix well. Protect the working standard solution from
light.
(B) 

Sample solution

. Dissolve an accurately weighed portion of the sample with sufficient diluting solution described in paragraph
(b)(1)(i)(A) of this section to obtain a concentration of approximately 200 micrograms of cefotetan per milliliter.
(C) 

Resolution test solution

. Place 10 milliliters of the working standard solution in a stoppered flask containing a few milligrams of magnesium
carbonate. Close the flask and sonicate for 10 minutes. If the solution is not slightly turbid, add more magnesium
carbonate and repeat sonication. Filter the turbid solution through a 0.5-micron filter and use within 2 hours. As
this solution stands, the tautomer concentration increases.
(iii) 

 System suitability requirements

_(A) 

Tailing factor

. The tailing factor (

T

) is satisfactory if it is not more than 1.3 at 10 percent of peak height in lieu of 5 percent of peak height. 
(B) 

Efficiency of the column

. The efficiency of the column (

n

) is satisfactory if it is greater than 1,500 theoretical plates.
(C) 

Resolution

. The resolution (

R

) between the peak for cefotetan and its tautomer is satisfactory if it is not less than 2.0.
(D) 

Coefficient of variation

. The coefficient of variation (

S



r

 in percent) of five replicate injections is satisfactory if it is not more than 2.0 percent. If the system suitability
requirements have been met, then proceed as described in 436.216(b) of this chapter. Alternate chromatographic
conditions are acceptable provided comparable system suitability requirements are met. However, the sample preparation
described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section should not be changed.
(iv) 

 Calculation

. Calculate the micrograms of cefotetan per milligram of sample as follows:
