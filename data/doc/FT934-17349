FT  01 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Daily flexibility
Sir, I am prompted to write by Diane Summers' article, 'TV revenue shows
first sign of upturn' (September 27).
It gives the impression that newspapers lack the flexibility to respond at
short notice to advertisers' demands.
It is rare for would-be advertisers to be turned away, and indeed the
newspapers' ability to accept copy at very short notice allows advertisers
to ensure that their copy is compatible with today's news. It may even
reflect it.
This flexibility and short response time are important contributors to the
unique strength of newspapers as an advertising medium.
