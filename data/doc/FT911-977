FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: SB beats weak dollar with advance to Pounds
253m
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group, increased pre-tax profit by
15.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year, despite a weaker dollar.
The taxable figure rose from Pounds 219m to Pounds 253m. SmithKline said the
increase would have been 26 per cent at stable exchange rates.
It used Dollars 1.89 to the pound as an average for the first quarter of
this year, compared with Dollars 1.66 last time.
The performance was helped by a Pounds 40m reduction in interest costs to
Pounds 15m. Net debt on March 31 fell from Pounds 1.47bn to Pounds 712m,
which reflected the impact of the Pounds 4.7bn merger between SmithKline
Beckman and Beecham in mid-1989.
Disposals between the two quarters, including cosmetics and foods
subsidiaries, brought in just over Pounds 700m. Last time, operations since
discontinued accounted for Pounds 26m of trading profit and Pounds 143m
turnover.
The continuing businesses increased trading profit to Pounds 268m (Pounds
247m) on sales of Pounds 1.11bn (Pounds 1.15bn). SmithKline said the growth
would have been 18 per cent and 5 per cent respectively at stable exchange
rates. Margins were helped by the merger, including slimming down the
worldwide head-count by 3,000.
In pharmaceuticals, trading profit rose 10 per cent to Pounds 199m (Pounds
181m) on sales that slipped to Pounds 615m (Pounds 643m). The group's
biggest product, the ulcer drug Tagamet, showed 8 per cent sales growth
despite competition in Japan. It is, however, expected to decline slowly,
having reached its zenith.
Sales of the antibiotics Augmentin and Timentin increased by 32 per cent and
14 per cent respectively, and a new anti-depressant, Seroxat, made a
promising start in the UK. Weaker geographic areas were the Gulf and Italy,
where rule changes caused disruption.
Trading profit from consumer brands inched ahead to Pounds 44m (Pounds 43m)
on sales which dipped to Pounds 306m (Pounds 312m). Both the UK and the US
were affected by recession, although Contac, the cold treatment, saw sales
growth of 31 per cent in the US.
Animal health made a profit of Pounds 14m (Pounds 13m) in spite of a 10 per
cent sales fall to Pounds 72m. This reflected the benefits of restructuring,
on the one hand, and the ill effects of competitive pressure in feline
vaccines and parasiticides on the other.
Margins also improved in the clinical laboratories, which increased profit
to Pounds 11m (Pounds 10m). One growth area was testing carried out for US
companies, which are increasingly monitoring employees for drug abuse.
Earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 12.1p (10.8p). The first quarter
dividend is 3.75p (3.4p) per A ordinary share and 43.09 cents (37 cents) per
equity unit.
The A share price closed down 22p at 809p.
