 

The Service will also hold public hearings to obtain additional verbal and written information. Hearings are proposed
to be held in Cheyenne, Wyoming; Boise, Idaho; Helena, Montana; Salt Lake City, Utah; Seattle, Washington; and Washington,
D.C. The location, dates, and times of these six hearings will be announced in a forthcoming issue of the 

Federal Register

 and in newspapers. 



National Environmental Policy Act 



An Environmental Impact Statement under the National Environmental Policy Act has been prepared and is available
to the public (see 

ADDRESSES

). This proposed rule is an implementation of the proposed action and does not require revision of the environmental
impact statement on the reintroduction of gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. 



Required Determinations 



This proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The rule will not
have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(5 U.S.C. 601 

et seq.

). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within the experimental
population area, significant economic impacts will not result from this action. Also, no direct costs, enforcement
costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this action and the
rule contains no record-keeping requirements, as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 

et seq.

). This rule does not require federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 because it would not have any significant
federalism effects as described in the order.
