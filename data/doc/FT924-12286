FT  21 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina to boost squid catch
ARGENTINA PLANS sharply to increase its catches in the South Atlantic of the
lucrative Illex squid, in direct competition with the Falkland Islands,
which rely heavily on the sale of fishing licences.
Mr Fernando Gutierrez, fisheries undersecretary, said yesterday that new
regulations would allow up to 40 foreign-owned, special squid fishing
vessels, known as jiggers, to operate in Argentine waters and catch up to
100,000 tonnes a year.
The decision is an important step towards liberalising Argentina's fishing
industry. By law, only locally-registered vessels may fish in its
territorial waters. However, the new regulations will allow foreign ships to
operate on a 'temporary charter' basis in association with Argentine
nationals. Argentina lacks jigger capacity of its own and hopes to increase
its share of Illex catches by attracting Asian-owned vessels to its waters.
Argentina expects to catch only 60,000 tonnes of squid this year, up from
40,000 tonnes in 1991. In comparison, the Falklands expects to catch about
160,000 tonnes of Illex this year, 8.6 per cent less than in 1991.
The Falklands introduced a successful licensing regime after the 1982
conflict with Argentina. Squid licences - sold largely to Japanese,
Taiwanese and South Korean companies - account for 75 per cent of the
Falklands' annual licence revenue of Pounds 24m.
Mr John Barton, the Falklands' director of fisheries, warned that
Argentina's decision would further depress already low Illex prices, and he
added that increased fishing effort by Argentina could damage Illex stocks.
The squid are very sensitive to environmental factors and over-fishing.
Falling prices and the risk to the resource have led the Falklands to
curtail fishing every year since 1989. Argentina, Britain and Falkland
officials will hold a new round of their biannual fishery talks in London
next month.
