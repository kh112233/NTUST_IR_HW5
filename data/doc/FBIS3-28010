  [Text] Seoul, Feb. 2 (YONHAP) -- Liberalization of travel 
to China will expand the tourism deficit to a record 1.3 billion 
U.S. dollars this year, the Korea National Tourism Corp. (KNTC) 
said on Wednesday. KNTC officials are predicting that 800,000 
Koreans will visit China this year as travel to that country is 
liberalized in March, compared with last year's 200,000 Korean 
tourists to China. But the number of Chinese visiting Korea 
will be the same as last year and they will spend a similar 
amount of money here. 
  The 800,000 Korean tourists to China are expected to spend 
1.68 billion dollars, up 1.26 billion dollars from 420 million 
dollars last year. In 1993 the average Korean tourist spent 
2,100 dollars in China, in contrast to an average expenditure of 
1,700 dollars for other destinations. 
  Earlier KNTC officials predicted this year's tourism account 
would be balanced, not taking into consideration the 
liberalization of travel to China. Thus the additional spending 
on tours to China, 1.26 billion dollars, is likely to account 
for the total travel deficit this year. 
  With the hosting of "Visit Korea Year 1994," KNTC officials 
had thought tourism earnings and spending would both be about 
4.2 billion dollars this year, putting an end to three 
consecutive years of travel deficits. 
  The travel deficit reached 358 million dollars in 1991, 523 
million dollars in 1992 and 584 million dollars in 1993. 
  Under these circumstances, the Transportation Ministry and 
KNTC are busy trying to curb the tourism deficit while travel 
agencies here are pushing more package tours to China.
