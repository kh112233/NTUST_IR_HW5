  [Text] Cairo, 22 Jan (MENA) -- Suspect Sami Salih, who was 
arrested in connection with the al-Ma'sarah incident Wednesday, 
has confessed that he is a member of a terrorist organization 
consisting of about 15 people and led by terrorist Tharwat 
Hajjaj. 
  The suspect told the Higher State Security Prosecution today 
that he conveyed instructions from some leading elements in 
Afghanistan to his colleagues. 
  He said he took part in the attack against the Majidah and 
al-Marwah movie houses in Hulwan, the attack on a tourist bus in 
Misr al-Qadimah, and a number of other terrorist acts. 
  Salih said he and others who frequented the apartments they 
rented in al-Ma'sarah made bombs and explosives to use in 
terrorist attacks. 
  He confessed that before his arrest in al-Ma'sarah on 
Wednesday, he and terrorists Muhammad Ahmad Farhan and Tharwat 
Hajjaj threw bombs at security forces. Hajjaj managed to flee.
