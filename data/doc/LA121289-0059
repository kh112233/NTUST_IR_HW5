BRIEFLY 
Man Charged With Attempted Smuggling: A Las Vegas man was arrested last week at 
Los Angeles International Airport and charged with attempting to illegally 
export restricted high-technology materials, federal authorities said. Joseph 
Nandori, a Hungarian native who authorities said is about 50 years old, was 
arrested while waiting to board a flight to Budapest. Brooks Ohlson, a special 
agent with the Commerce Department's Office of Export Enforcement, said Nandori 
was carrying computer technical manuals, computer software and scientific 
instruments.
