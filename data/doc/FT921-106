FT  31 MAR 92 / World Trade News: EC criticised by US over trade policy
THE US Trade Rep-resentative's Office yesterday released its seventh
National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, the yearly
cataloguing of the rest of the world's trade transgressions, writes Nancy
Dunne in Washington.
The EC attracts 15 pages of criticism, ranging from high tariffs to 'buy
national' policies to oilseed production subsidies. A new barrier listed is
the EC ban on fur from animals caught in leghold traps - a measure of the
type often imposed by the US and criticised as an attempt to foist American
environmental standards on others.
