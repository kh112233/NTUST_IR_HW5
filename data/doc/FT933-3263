FT  15 SEP 93 / 'Over 1,000 a day' die in Angola
MORE THAN 1,000 people are dying every day in Angola's protracted civil war
or from its effects, the highest death toll in any current conflict in the
world, the United Nations reported last night, writes Michael LIttlejohns,
UN Correspondent, in New York.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, said intensified
fighting had dramatically worsened already dire humanitarian problems. Some
three million Angolans, mostly women, children and the elderly, were victims
of what he termed a 'catastrophic' tragedy.
In a report to the Security Council, which was expected to act on it today,
Mr Boutros Ghali called for new measures to deliver international aid to the
needy. Saying a lasting peace could not be achieved through force, he urged
the government and Unita insurgents led by Dr Jonas Savimbi, to resume
ceasefire talks.
