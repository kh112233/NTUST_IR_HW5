FT  31 JUL 93 / Letter: Notes for avant-garde ear
Sir, In his article on the future of the London orchestras (Arts, July
24/25) Sir Alan Peacock asserted derogatorily that 'many serious composers
of today are not primarily interested in winning over the public'.
But why should they be? Those composers whose works are most likely to stand
the test of time are by definition avant-garde in the sense that their
unique creativity extends musical boundaries beyond the previous experience
of the listening public.
The 20th century is notable (and notorious) for the number of major
compositions that did not win over the public when first performed, but
which have subsequently become standard works in the repertoire.
If the Arts Council lacks both historical perspective and vision and expects
all composers to be user-friendly and market-oriented it will stifle the
imperative originality from which great works spring.
