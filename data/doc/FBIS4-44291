  [Text] Strasbourg, France June 28 (A.A.) -- Five members 
of the abolished Democracy Party (DEP) arrived here today to 
hold contacts at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe. 
  The six deputies fled Turkey June 15, one day before the 
Constitutional Court banned the party on the grounds that it 
supposedly spread separatist propaganda and sided with the 
separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
organization. 
  Attending a pro-PKK rally in Frankfurt over the weekend, 
Zubeyir Aydar, one of the deputies, said about the recent PKK 
bombings in tourist places which wounded about 20 people and 
killed a British tourist that, "we regret the bombings but we 
(PKK supporters) had to do it." 
  The deputies will reportedly meet the leaders of commissions 
and political groups here and are trying to schedule a press 
conference at the Council of Europe on Wednesday [29 June].
