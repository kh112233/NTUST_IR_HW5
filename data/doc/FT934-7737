FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (13): A quantum
leap - Johannesburg Stock Exchange
BACK in 1986 when sanctions began in earnest, the US sold and Europe bought.
Now, at least as far as the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is concerned,
the positions are reversed. Europe is cautious, the US euphoric.
Down on Diagonal Street, home of the JSE, brokers groan pleasurably at the
stampede of US investors knocking on their door - a veritable Wall Street
who's who. Of course, the US presence on the JSE has already been highly
visible in 1993, being largely responsible for driving the bull markets in
bonds and gold shares. But since ANC president Nelson Mandela called for the
lifting of economic sanctions in September, interest has soared. Once
limited to speculators, hedge funds and specialists, especially on the gold
board, the heavy artillery is massing just over the brow.
It will be some time yet before the debris of US state and municipal
sanctions is finally cleared, and fund managers who are responsible to
trustees will keep a watchful eye on political developments before making
any significant decisions. The view on Diagonal Street, however, is that it
is now a question of when, rather than if, funds flow. A broker comments:
'If you aggregate the figures we've heard, there'll be a lot of sheep trying
to get through a very narrow gate.' One Hong Kong fund manager
visitingJohannesburg said he was convinced investors would drive the
price/earnings ratio of the JSE from 15 to 25, as they have with other
emerging markets.
As JSE-watchers point out, it is hardly a typical emerging market - more
than 100 years old and with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 145bn
(at the financial rand exchange rate of R4.30/Dollars 1), it is one of the
10 largest in the world. There are about 80 stocks with a market
capitalisation of more than Dollars 200m, the cut-off point often used by
international fund managers to identify stocks they are prepared to hold.
Hence the preference among analysts for describing the JSE as a
're-emerging' market.
Two caveats need to be entered about the bull scenario for the JSE. First,
if the main international stock markets crack, the Dow Jones industrial
index in particular, then the JSE is sure to follow. Second, South Africa
must achieve a relatively stable political transition.
Assuming these hurdles are cleared, then the case for the JSE is easily
developed. US investors and fund managers are looking to invest an
increasing portion of their assets outside the US to improve returns. Given
the JSE accounts for about 0.9 per cent of total world stock market
capitalisation, and most US fund managers hold little if any SA stock, it is
reasonable to assume a flow of funds. Until recently, virtually no US
analysts followed South African stocks. As they start to cover them, so
funds are likely to follow.
A recent study of 47 global emerging market funds (mostly UK and US) by the
UK group Micropal shows that as at June 30, 1993, only 0.07 per cent of
their Dollars 8bn assets were invested in South Africa. This process will
gather impetus when Morgan Stanley develops a South Africa index for
inclusion in its world index, and should the International Finance
Corporation grant the JSE emerging market status. (SA stocks qualify because
domestic per capita income is below the Dollars 7,910 cut-off).
The case for the JSE is considerably hardened by fairly reliable talk of six
to seven South (or southern) Africa country funds being established.
Alliance Capital Management Corporation, one of the largest investment
management funds in the US with about Dollars 110bn of funds under
management, and backed by Merrill Lynch, has already lodged a prospectus
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch The Southern Africa
Fund - a closed end investment company. These funds could easily raise
Dollars 500m. Dollars 500m
The chief concern about any large inflow of funds is whether the JSE, with
its notoriously poor tradeability, can manage them. Latest JSE figures show
annualised liquidity at about 7 per cent, but in recent years this has been
closer to 4 per cent. Figures from Johannesburg brokers Ivor Jones, Roy &amp; Co
show the most liquid domestic industrial stock, SA Breweries, has a monthly
turnover of only Dollars 12m. The most liquid stock, by a long margin, is De
Beers, with a monthly turnover of about Dollars 57m. The main cause of the
low liquidity is exchange control. South Africa's large institutional cash
flows - about R40bn per annum, of which at least a quarter will make its way
into equities - are forced to chase a small pool of domestic quality scrip.
Understandably, the good stock they get they are inclined to hold. If strong
buying pressures do materialise, then the upward trend of prices will help
loosen stock. The yield-driven, short-term focus of some of the speculative
funds already in the JSE will make it more volatile, and also boost
liquidity.
South African bonds will also attract attention. Real yields on long bonds
of around 8 per cent for foreign investors compare favourably with the
returns available in industrial countries. South Africa is a good risk not
to default, the market is well organised and liquid, with more than Dollars
1bn daily trading volume common, the bonds offer prospective capital gains
from the fall in inflation, and there is the possibility of currency gains
from the appreciation of the financial rand.
Investments on the JSE are done through the volatile financial rand, whose
movements are capable of wiping out gains in the underlying investments. For
investors coming into the bond market in particular, where volumes are quite
large, they have to buy the currency before the bond. As one broker
commented: 'The currency leg is the narrow gate, not the bond.' Political
stability will help stabilise this market, but investors should treat it
with caution.
