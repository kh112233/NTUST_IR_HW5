FT  28 AUG 92 / Rostock rushes in extra riot police
AUTHORITIES in east Germany's riot-torn city of Rostock are working
desperately to prevent clashes this weekend between right-wing extremists
and thousands of left-wing counter-protesters, following a fifth night of
violent attacks on asylum seekers and the police.
Thousands of police reinforcements are being rushed in from northern Germany
to head off a confrontation when more than 10,000 left-wingers from all over
Germany are expected to stage a counter-demonstration against the right in
Rostock tomorrow.
Last night, some 2,000 people marched in silence through the city in protest
at the violence. 'If we capitulate to violence, we have lost democracy,'
said Mr Christoph Kleermann, president of the city council.
However, although the mood among ordinary Rostockers has changed, they
remain adamant that a hostel for asylum seekers should not have been located
in the middle of a housing estate.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday called the riots a disgrace which damaged
Germany's reputation.
The riots on Wednesday night spread to Eberswalde near Berlin, scene of a
recent trial of five skinheads who killed an Angolan asylum seeker in 1990.
Neo-Nazi demonstrators marched from the town centre to a freshly evacuated
hostel for asylum seekers shouting 'Sieg Heil' and 'solidarity with
Rostock.' In clashes with the police 32 demonstrators were arrested.
