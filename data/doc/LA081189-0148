SWEDES OUST SOVIET CONSULAR AIDE 
Sweden said today that it has expelled a Soviet consular official for 
industrial espionage. 
The Foreign Ministry said the man, who worked for the Soviet consular mission 
in the western port of Gothenburg, has left Sweden. It did not reveal his name 
or position. 
"He engaged in activity incompatible with his duties and attempted to get 
information about Swedish and foreign technology," a ministry official said. He 
said the man's activity had not harmed Sweden but might have if it had been 
allowed to continue. 
Swedish relations with the Soviet Union have been strained by recent Swedish 
allegations that its Moscow embassy was bugged as well as longstanding concerns 
that Soviet submarines routinely violate Swedish territorial waters.
