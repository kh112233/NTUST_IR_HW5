The jury in the federal tax evasion trial of hotel queen Leona Helmsley 
deliberated for a second day without reaching a verdict. Two hours into 
deliberations, they sent out a note requesting documents relating to a 
Helmsley-controlled partnership that owned three of the Helmsley hotels in 
Manhattan. The partnership, Realesco Equities Corp., is named in two sets of 
charges -- aiding in the filing of false corporate tax returns and mail fraud 
-- against Helmsley and her two co-defendants, ex-aides Frank Turco and Joseph 
Licari. The jury also asked for a June, 1985, memo that Turco had forwarded to 
Licari and on which he had written: "Please deep six after reading." The 
document was a progress report on renovations at Helmsley's Connecticut estate. 
Helmsley, 69, is charged with evading $1.2 million in federal taxes by charging 
personal expenses to her businesses.
