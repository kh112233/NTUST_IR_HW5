SOVIET FREIGHT TRAINS COLLIDE; 5 DIE, 100 HURT 
Five people were killed and 100 injured when two freight trains collided in 
Soviet Kazakhstan, starting a fire that destroyed 13 homes, the Communist Party 
daily Pravda reported Monday. 
The accident occurred Saturday outside a railway station in Alma-Ata, capital 
of the Soviet republic. A train carrying six tankers of liquid propane hit 
another train that was switching tracks, Tass said. The tanker train caught 
fire and one tanker exploded, spreading the flames to nearby houses where 26 
families lived, Pravda said.
