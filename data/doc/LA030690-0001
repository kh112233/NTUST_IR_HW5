LEAD LEVELS PUT 25% OF SOUTHLAND CHILDREN AT RISK 
More than 25% of Southern California children -- and more than 40% in the San 
Diego metropolitan area -- may have levels of lead in their blood that could 
diminish learning ability and cause behavioral problems, according to a 
national study made public Monday. 
Nearly 60% of the children in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area are estimated to 
have lead levels that could impair learning, according to the study, which 
found rates to be at least 33% in seven California population areas of 1 
million or more people. 
The study by the Environmental Defense Fund is the first to calculate the 
potential lead exposure to children in specific U.S. metropolitan areas. The 
report used estimates from the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease 
Registry, whose data was based on the number of young children, ages 6 months 
to 5 years, living in older houses where lead-based paint is usually found, on 
family income levels, and on some screening programs that relied on blood tests 
to measure lead levels. 
"Lead poisoning is beyond question the single most significant preventable 
disease of environmental origin in the United States," Ellen K. Silbergeld, a 
toxicologist on the staff of the 100,000-member environmental organization, 
said at a Washington news conference. "Over 3 million children currently have 
levels of lead in the toxic range. They are not at risk for disease -- they 
have lead toxicity." 
About 58% of the children in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area and at least a 
third in San Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Santa Barbara 
counties were estimated to have lead levels of more than 10 micrograms per 
deciliter of blood, an amount that generally produces no physical symptoms but 
can reduce by four to seven points a child's performance on IQ tests. About a 
quarter of the Ventura County children were estimated to have lead at those 
levels. 
Although the study did not actually measure the lead in the blood of all urban 
children, the findings largely confirmed, within a 5% margin, the results of 
smaller investigations that did take blood tests. 
The Centers for Disease Control now recommend intervention at levels of 25 
micrograms per deciliter of blood. But recent epidemiological studies that 
found damage at levels as low as 10 and 15 micrograms have prompted the CDC to 
review its guideline. It is expected to be lowered within a year. 
In the San Diego metropolitan area, 40.3% of the children were estimated to 
have lead levels of more than 10 micrograms while 12.6% were estimated to have 
levels of at least 15 micrograms, according to the study. 
In the Los Angeles-Long Beach metropolitan area, 21% of the young children were 
estimated to have levels greater than 15 micrograms. A recent state public 
health investigation that relied on blood samples of young children in Compton 
and Wilmington found that 20% of the youngsters had levels of at least 15 
micrograms, the lowest level examined in the study. 
Dr. Lynn Goldman, a pediatrician and epidemiologist who heads the California 
Department of Health Services section that did the Compton and Wilmington 
testing, said she had not examined the methodology used in Monday's report but 
found its numbers "not surprising." The U.S. public health survey from which 
the environmental group extrapolated its figures contained "reasonable" 
assumptions, she said. 
She noted, however, that the environmental group's estimates may "reflect the 
highest-risk areas" in some communities. For example, she said, a recent 
investigation by her section found 17% of the children in a "high-risk" Oakland 
neighborhood had levels of at least 15 micrograms of lead per deciliter of 
blood. 
By comparison, Monday's report estimated that 19.7% of all young children in 
the San Francisco-Oakland metropolitan area have such levels. Goldman said she 
would have expected the level in the entire region to be lower, not higher, 
than the Oakland neighborhood, which contained mostly older, dilapidated 
housing. 
Karen L. Florini, an attorney for the environmental group, acknowledged that 
the estimates could be high for some regions. But she said they also may be too 
low for other regions because they fail to take into account additional 
exposure from lead smelters or other lead-producing industries in some 
communities. 
"We're not trying to say that you would get these specific numbers if you 
tested the children," she said. "But even if they were 50% too high, they still 
indicate an epidemic by anybody's definition." 
It is virtually impossible to determine the extent to which an individual child 
may be impaired at exposures of 10 or 15 micrograms of lead per deciliter of 
blood. Some children, because of such factors as nutrition and genetics, may 
not be affected while others will perform poorly in school as a result of the 
same exposure. Moreover, the loss of a few IQ points may not make a great 
difference in a child's ultimate achievements. 
It is only when large populations are studied that significant differences and 
reasons for concern emerge. Lead exposure in a large population will 
significantly reduce the number of those with superior intelligence and 
increase the number with below-average intelligence. 
Banned for most uses in 1977, lead-based paint still can be found in millions 
of American homes. Children usually are exposed through household dust 
contaminated by peeling, flaking or chalking paint. Young children also may be 
poisoned during teething by mouthing on window sills that contain leaded paint. 
In addition to reducing IQ, lead in young children can impair reaction time and 
the ability to concentrate and cause short-term memory loss. The longer the 
exposure, the greater the damage. Impairment is believed to be permanent, even 
after a child's lead levels are reduced to relatively low amounts. 
At congressional hearings later this week, the Environmental Defense Fund will 
propose creation of a $1.5-billion-a-year trust fund to remove lead-based paint 
from housing. The money would be raised through an excise tax on the production 
and importation of lead. Estimated costs for professional removal of lead-based 
paint from residences run between $2,000 and $10,000 a unit. 
Dolan reported from Los Angeles and Abramson from Washington. 
LEAD LEVELS IN CALIFORNIA CHILDREN 
 Chart shows the percentage of children ages 6 months to 5 years who are 
projected to exceed selected blood lead levels, broken down in selected 
population groups. Figures are expressed in micrograms of lead per deciliter of 
blood (MCG/DL). The federal Centers for Disease Control is currently reviewing 
its definition of "lead toxicity," now set at 25 micrograms per deciliter of 
blood. The CDC is expected to adopt a new definition of 10 to 15 micrograms per 
deciliter within the year.
