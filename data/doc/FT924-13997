THE FAMILY of a workman killed in a Channel tunnel accident two years ago
was awarded Pounds 50,000 agreed damages against the consortium constructing
the tunnel, Translink Joint Venture, in the High Court yesterday.
Mr William Cartman, 33, of Washington, Tyne and Wear, was earning more than
Pounds 800 a week as a grouter when the accident happened on May 7 1990. He
was crushed between a moving crane and the fixed steel frame of a boring
machine. Mr Jeffrey Burke QC, for the family, told Judge Adrian Whitfield it
was accepted Mr Cartman was 25 per cent to blame for the accident. Half of
the agreed damages will be shared equally by the couple's two children.
