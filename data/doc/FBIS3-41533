  [Text] The Conservation industry has lost over 
E[Emalangeni]3.5 million worth of game from rhino-poaching alone 
in the last five years. This means about 70 percent of 
Swaziland's rhino have been wiped out by poachers since 1988 
when the commercial rhino horn poaching started. 
  Nature Conservationist, Mr. Ted Reilly, said this figure 
represents a direct cash value of animals poached. ``However, a 
more realistic value of the loss of Swaziland probably exceeds 
that figure by more than 10 times,'' he said. 
  ``The value of these losses is only just beginning to be 
felt. Those poached animals cannot be simply replaced, there is 
no insurance policy that will pay out the country for its loss 
of breeding stock.'' 
  ``Rhino, in particular, are slow breeding animals. Many of 
the slaughtered rhinos have been mature and productive animals. 
Many were heavily pregnant when poached. How do you put the 
value on the years it will take to get back to the point that we 
were at in restoring Swaziland's decimated wildlife heritage?'' 
  Mr. Reilly says because of the poaching pandemic, jobs have 
been lost, foreign exchange, tourism dwindled and investment in 
the industry discouraged. ``How can one invest if there is no 
guarantee that the money he spends in re-introducing species to 
his farm doesn't all disappear in front of his eyes as poachers 
decimate his breeding stock?'' 
  Asked what happens to trophies (target parts of animals) 
that 
have been confiscated from poachers, Mr. Reilly said in most 
cases the exhibits have mysteriously disappeared. ``There are 
also cases where one sees in the newspaper about elephant tusks 
and rhino horns being destroyed in a fire.'' 
  ``These are some of the factors giving rise to Section 24(5) 
in the new law which stipulates that no more than trotters or 
the head of the animal shall be needed as an exhibit.'' ``We 
have even had refusal of acceptance of a prisoner at Simunye 
because the whole animal didn't accompany the accused. The 
officer insisted that we bring the whole animal.'' 
  Mr. Reilly also blamed the courts for not being that 
``supportive'' in curbing the poaching crime. ``The draconian 
measures we have had to introduce in the new law are a result of 
courts failing to properly and responsibly apply the law.'' 
  ``The Game Amendment Act would, in large part, have been 
unnecessary had the courts been supportive. The Non-Bailable 
Offenses Order has similar origins.'' 
  To this, Mr. Reilly referred a case reported in THE TIMES 
early this year whereby the accused, Salatiyala Kunene of 
Khuphuka area, had his case withdrawn because the exhibits had 
been destroyed. 
  Mr. Reilly reported a long list of animal species already on 
the verge of extinction, poaching being one of the contributing 
factors.
