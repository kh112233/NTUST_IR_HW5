SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The objective of the project is continue tests to evaluate the supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) pilot plant developed
under Cooperative Agreement DEFC0788ID12711. The pilot plant configuration was developed to treat
corrosive wastes and waste with high solids content. DOE has no recent, current, or planned solicitations under which
this proposal would be eligible. The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory continuation of an activity
funded by DOE and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion
of the project. DOE and commercial implementation of SCWO technology will reduce the volume of hazardous and mixed
waste currently stored and generated in the United States. SCWO technology is recognized as a high potential alternative
technology to incineration, providing cleaner effluents and with less institutional barriers than incineration.
The award will be for one year at a total estimated cost of $700,000. Cost share is anticipated to be 10% of the project
costs. Statutory authority for this award is Pub. L. 93577, Federal Non-Nuclear Energy Research and Development
Act of 1974. The Federal Domestic Catalog Number is 81.103.
