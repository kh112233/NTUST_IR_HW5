  [Text] Credible legal sources have told Emisoras Caracol 
that members of the so-called Cali Cartel will not surrender en 
masse because of penal code stipulations, more particularly 
because of the vagueness and ambiguity of Article 389-E, which 
lately has been the subject of a spirited controversy among the 
Prosecutor General's Office, the Attorney General's Office, and 
officials of the Justice Ministry. 
  This recent controversy has prompted lawyers of the drug 
traffickers, who are being accused by authorities, to revise 
their strategy. Therefore, one of the Ordinolas [as heard] and 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela might be surrendering soon. 
  The mass surrenders that were announced at the end of 1993, 
however, following Pablo Escobar's death, will not take place. 
This was fully confirmed to Emisoras Caracol. 
  In the meantime, "Caracol's 0600-0900" learned the United 
States is very concerned about the latest Cali Cartel 
developments, and it has virtually suspended all cooperation in 
delivering and providing proof for pending trials of Cali 
Cartel's leaders. 
  The refusal to deliver evidence is based on the fact that 
the 
U.S. Government and Justice Department are currently unclear 
about what path Colombian justice will take regarding the 
Cartel. If the evidence were to be submitted to the Colombian 
Government, then the opportunity to use it in pending U.S. 
trials of the so-called drug traffickers will be lost.
