  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 16 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Monday, reiterated Malaysia's 
stand that the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) should 
be a party to any peace initiatives on Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Our stand is firm and consistent with the wishes of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina itself, he told reporters at the international 
airport in Subang, near here, on his return from the 
Malaysia-Mauritius joint commission meeting. 
  He was commenting on a report that several European 
countries 
had excluded the OIC in their efforts to end the conflict in 
Bosnia, where Muslims are facing ethnic cleansing by the Serbs. 
  Abdullah said Bosnia-Herzegovina had emphasised at a recent 
UN Security Council meeting that it would only accept any peace 
process which involved the OIC. 
  On the OIC contact group's decision that the OIC was 
prepared 
to fill the void created by any withdrawal of UN peacekeepers in 
Bosnia, he said Malaysia's stand was clear in that it would 
continue to help the country defend its sovereignty and 
independence. 
  We definitely support the group's decision. Any OIC efforts 
that are beneficial to Bosnia-Herzegovina will have our support, 
he said. 
  He said Malaysia welcomed the U.S. Senate committee's 
decision asking for a lifting of the arms embargo on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We sincerely hope that the lifting of the embargo will be 
done in the true sense of the word without any condition, he 
said.
