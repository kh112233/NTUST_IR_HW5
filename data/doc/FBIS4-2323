<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Tianjin municipal statistical </F>
bureau on the development of the national economy and society in 
1993; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Various fronts throughout the municipality deeply 
and earnestly implemented the important speech of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress, and the tasks 
adopted at the sixth municipal party congress and the first 
session of the 12th municipal people's congress in 1993. Cadres 
and the masses across the municipality accelerated reform and 
opening up by emancipating their minds, seeking truth from 
facts, seizing the opportunity, and boldly engaging in practice. 
Based on the former foundation, they also achieved new 
developments in economic construction and various social 
undertakings by persistently combining the tasks between 
increasing the total supply and demand and upgrading the quality 
of economic operation; between reinforcing the dynamics in 
reform and opening up and accelerating the economic development; 
between vigorously switching losses to profits and upgrading the 
economic quality as a whole; and between enhancing the macro 
readjustment and control and promoting the readjustment of 
economic structure. The actual living standards of both urban 
and rural residents were further upgraded. A good trend of 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national 
economy as a whole was maintained. The major economic targets 
were overfulfilled and the increased scales in this regard 
surpassed those of 1992. Some of the increased scales reached 
previous peaks. According to initial statistics, the municipal 
GNP in 1993 reached 50.3 billion yuan and showed an 11.8 percent 
increase calculated in term of 1992 comparable prices. This has 
been the second rapid growth scored by the municipality in this 
regard since the enforcement of reform and opening up. Of this 
rapid growth, the added value of the tertiary industry reached 
17.9 billion yuan and showed an 11.8 percent increase over 1992. 
Its proportion reached 35.6 percent of the GNP. The per capita 
GNP exceeded 5,000 yuan and increased from 4,696 yuan in 1992 to 
5,700 yuan in 1993. The annual local financial revenue reached 
7.315 billion yuan and showed a 21.8 percent increase calculated 
in terms of 1992 comparable prices. This has been the fastest 
growth in this regard over the past 10 years. The municipality 
took a new step in conducting reform in the economic systems in 
1993 and the construction of various markets was accelerated. 
The enterprise reform was further deepened. The municipality 
achieved progress in implementing and enforcing the "enterprise 
law" and "regulations" and approved 58 enterprises that took up 
the pilot work of reform in share-holding systems. Over 60 
percent of the commercial enterprises across the municipality 
enforced the system of "allowing the state-owned enterprises to 
be run by individuals." The reform in the three internal systems 
of enterprises was accelerated. Major problems cropping up in 
economic operation are as follows: The economic development is 
not sufficient, the light and textile industries as well as the 
tertiary industry are not developing fast enough, the economic 
results scored by some enterprises are poor, the income of some 
staff members and workers is relatively low, and the scale of 
markets needs to be further expanded. 
<H5>  1. Agriculture </H5>
  The agricultural economic sector achieved stable 
development. 
The municipality further enhanced the basic position of 
agriculture in 1993, actively implemented various agricultural 
policies, and pushed forward the reform in various styles and 
the establishment of socialized service systems for rural areas. 
It also vigorously carried out the activities of having science 
and technology make agriculture prosperous; readjusting the 
structure of planting undertakings; promoting the development of 
agriculture with high yield, fine quality, and high benefit; and 
developing the commodity economy to promote the stable 
development of the agricultural economic sector. The annual 
added value of agriculture reached 3.1 billion yuan and showed a 
1.4 percent increase over 1992. The structure of farm products 
was readjusted somewhat. The 1993 acreage of farmland on which 
grain and cash crops were planted decreased and that of melons, 
fruits, and vegetables increased. The municipality has 
consecutively reaped a bumper grain harvest over the past 10 
years in spite of the serious natural disasters. The total 
grain output in the year reached 1.998 billion kg and topped the 
previous peak again. The per mu yield of grains reached 295 kg. 
The output of cotton decreased somewhat due to the decrease of 
sowed farmland of cotton crop. The production of major 
non-staple foodstuffs showed a stable increase. 
  Output of major agricultural and sideline products was as 
follows: 


                            1993                      Percentage increase over 
                                                      1992

  Agricultural input increased, and agricultural production 
conditions improved. In 1993, financial institutions in the 
municipality newly granted 1.605 billion yuan of more loans to 
agriculture, an increase of 1.5 percent over 1992. By the end 
of 1993, the aggregate power of farm machinery reached 4,700,500 
kilowatts, an increase of 4.7 percent over the figure at the end 
of 1992. There were 23,900 heavy-duty trucks, an increase of 
12.8 percent. Rural consumption of electricity was 2.311 
billion kilowatt hours, an increase of 5.9 percent over 1992. 
New achievements were scored in the drive of invigorating 
agriculture through science and technology. Fine varieties of 
corn, dry farming and thin planting of rice, growing of cotton 
seedlings with plastic sheeting, and transplanting of aquatic 
products began to be popularized. 
  The commodity rate of agricultural products was raised 
further. In 1993, the total value of agricultural commodities 
was 5.34 billion yuan, an increase of 15.6 percent over 1992, 
and the commodity rate rose from 74.3 percent in 1992 to 75.6 
percent. Of this, the commodity rate of cropping products rose 
from 63.4 percent to 64.6 percent, and that of livestock 
products rose from 87.8 percent to 90.1 percent. 
  The rural economy developed comprehensively. In 1993, the 
total product of rural society was 65.199 billion yuan, an 
increase of 38.9 percent over 1992. Of this, the total output 
value of agriculture was 6.056 billion yuan, an increase of 4.6 
percent. In 1993, there were 30,800 township and town 
enterprises in the municipality, with a total employment of 
885,700 persons. The total income of these enterprises was 
37.121 billion yuan, an increase of 33.6 percent over 1992. 
<H5>  2. Industry and Construction </H5>
  In 1993, under the guidance of market mechanism, industrial 
enterprises vigorously increased the dynamics of reform, 
readjusted product mix, attended to the work of halting deficits 
and increasing profits, and improved economic efficiency, thus 
maintaining the trend of rapid development. In 1993, the added 
value of industry was 26.65 billion yuan, up by 13.2 percent 
over 1992. Total industrial output value was 124.666 billion 
yuan, up by 24.5 percent, a record high in terms of increase 
margin since the commencement of reform and opening up. Of 
this, output value of state-owned industrial enterprises 
increased by 5.3 percent; that of collectively owned industrial 
enterprises, 23.7 percent; that of the three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises, 90.0 percent; that of township and 
town industrial enterprises, 40.4 percent; and that of large and 
medium-sized industrial enterprises, 8.6 percent. 
  The industrial structure was further readjusted and the 
light industry achieved overall development. The total output 
value scored by industrial enterprises at or above the township 
level across the municipality in 1993 reached 83.957 billion 
yuan and showed a 17.9 percent increase over 1992. Of the total 
output value, that of heavy industrial enterprises reached 
48.424 billion yuan and showed a 25.2 percent increase over 
1992. The newly increased output value of heavy industrial 
enterprises accounted for 76.5 percent in that scored by 
industrial enterprises at or above the township level in the 
year. Of the newly increased output value, that of the auto 
industry showed a 36.8 percent increase; that of 
machine-building industry, a 32 percent increase; and that of 
electronic instrument industry, a 32.9 percent increase. The 
production of light industry showed a stable increase over 1992. 
The annual total output value scored by light industrial 
enterprises reached 35.533 billion yuan and showed a 9.3 percent 
increase over 1992. In addition, non state-owned industries in 
which township enterprises and the "three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises" are of main parts have become the 
new growing points of the municipal industrial economic sector. 
The newly increased output value scored by township enterprises 
and the "three types of foreign-funded enterprises" in the year 
accounted for 83.1 percent in that scored by industrial 
enterprises at or above the township level across the 
municipality, which have become new forces in the municipal 
industrial development. The proportion of output value scored 
by non state-owned industrial enterprises increased from 33.6 
percent in 1992 to 40.7 percent in 1993. In line with the 
demands of markets, the output of some major industrial products 
increased in 1993 and that of some other industrial products 
decreased. 
  The output of major industrial products was as fellow:

  The marketing rate of industrial products clearly 
increased. In 1993, the sales volume of industrial enterprises 
at or above the township level totaled 80.442 billion yuan, up 
by 20.3 percent over 1992; and the marketing rate of the 
products of these enterprises reached 98.99 percent, up by 3.25 
percentage points over 1992. Of this, the marketing rate of 
heavy industrial products was 99.44 percent, up by 2.18 
percentage points over 1992, and that of light industrial 
products was 98.17 percent, up by 4.46 percentage points. 
  Rapid progress was made in developing new products. In 1993, 
industrial enterprises put 1,400 varieties of new products into 
production, and developed 26,400 new patterns and new designs 
for light and textile products, of which, 22,100 were put into 
production. The output value of new products was 7.17 billion 
yuan, up by 38.4 percent over 1992. The rate of output value of 
new products rose from 12 percent in 1992 to 14 percent. 
  The industrial economic efficiency improved somewhat, and 
some results were achieved in the work of halting deficits and 
increasing profits. In 1993, industrial enterprises at or above 
the township level that exercise independent accounting realized 
7.2 billion yuan in profit and tax, up by 21.2 percent, of 
which, 2.49 billion yuan was profit, up by 5.1 percent. The 
state-owned industrial enterprises covered by local budget 
realized 3.388 billion yuan in profit and tax, up by 13.9 
percent over 1992, of which, 1.264 billion yuan was profits, up 
by 0.2 percent. The upward trend of losses sustained by 
enterprises was checked. 
  Construction trade production developed further. In 1993, 
the construction trade fulfilled 2.65 billion yuan in added 
value, up by 11.3 percent over 1992. Economic efficiency of 
construction enterprises picked up in an all-around manner. The 
number of enterprises suffering losses decreased, with the range 
of deficits dropping from 25 percent in 1992 to 17.4 percent, 
and effecting an increase of 148 percent in profits. 
<H5>  3. Domestic Commerce (Goods and Materials) and Market Prices </H5>
  In 1993, along with the development of the socialist market 
economy, the construction pace of the market structure was 
accelerated, the scale of commodity circulation was expanded 
further, the supply of goods was ample, and the marketing of 
goods was brisk. The annual added value of commerce, catering 
service, and goods storage trade was 5.05 billion yuan, up by 
12.8 percent over 1992. The total volume of goods purchased by 
commercial units was 54.922 billion yuan, up by 22.7 percent; 
and the total volume of goods marketed by these units was 54.041 
billion yuan, up by 24.5 percent. 
  The retail market was brisk and stable. The total volume of 
retail sales was 22.772 billion yuan, up by 18.4 percent over 
1992. After deducting the price factor, the actual increase was 
3.6 percent. Of this, the retail volume of consumer goods was 
21.744 billion yuan, up by 20 percent. The consumption 
mentality of residents was relatively stable. Considering the 
marketing of consumer goods of various categories, retail volume 
of food increased by 11.1 percent, that of clothes increased by 
25.4 percent, and that of articles for daily use increased by 
27.2 percent. Consumers continued to favor fine quality, 
brandname, and new but cheap commodities. 
  The means of production market was brisk in both buying and 
selling, and a new breakthrough was made in building the market 
for production elements. In 1993, the total volume of 
commodities purchased by goods supply and marketing enterprises 
was 19.614 billion yuan, up by 35.5 percent over 1992, and the 
total volume of commodities marketed by these enterprises was 
21.032 billion yuan, up by 38.6 percent. A number of large 
wholesale markets, such as the Beiyang rolled steel market, the 
chemical industrial market, the textile raw materials market, 
and the motor market, started business one after another. By 
the end of 1993, there were 28 markets for means of production 
in the municipality, of which, six were state- level markets, 
and four were regional markets. According to the statistics 
compiled from 19 markets for means of production, in 1993, the 
total value of commodities that were put on market for the first 
time was 12.4 billion yuan, the business volume of the 
commodities that were put on market for the first time was 12.1 
billion yuan, and the total trading volume of commodities was 
21.462 billion yuan. Service functions and the service sphere 
were expanded further. 
  Price reform was promoted steadily, and the market role in 
forming prices was notably enhanced. Tianjin's price reform was 
extended fairly greatly in 1993, price control on grain, oil, 
and perishable commodities were lifted, and prices regulated by 
the market were further expanded. 
  Various 1993 price indexes were as follows (when regarding 
those of the preceding year as 100):

<H5>  4. Foreign Economic Relations and Regional Cooperation </H5>
  Tianjin achieved a new breakthrough in opening to the 
outside 
world in 1993, with the areas opened to the outside world 
continuously expanding, the investment climate further 
improving, and an initial pattern of multiform, multi-layered, 
multi-channel, and multi-directional opening to the outside 
world taking shape. 
  Tianjin used more foreign capital and became a hot spot of 
foreign investment. Trans-national companies of the world 
represented by the 10 famous electronic companies, such as 
Motorola Company of the United States, Nippon Electronic Company 
(NEC), and Samsung Corporation of ROK, came to Tianjin to make 
investment one after another, and the countries and regions 
where foreign investors came from increased from some 50 in the 
preceding year to more than 70. In 1993, Tianjin signed 
contracts on establishing 3,538 foreign-funded enterprises of 
the three types, up 110 percent form the preceding year; and the 
foreign investment involved totaled $2.256 billion, up 85 
percent. Both figures exceeded the total amounts of the 
preceding 14 years. Of these foreign-funded enterprises, 2,007 
were invested exclusively by foreign firms, and they involved 
$982 million of foreign investment, up 150 and 59.4 percent, 
respectively. Among the foreign investment projects signed in 
the year, 1,745 were related to the tertiary industry, and the 
contracted amount of foreign investment in these projects 
totaled $1.178 billion, up 190 and 120 times, respectively, from 
the preceding year; and their proportions increased from 35.7 
and 43.5 percent, respectively, in the preceding year to 49.3 
and 52.2 percent, respectively. By the end of 1993, Tianjin had 
signed contracts for 6,136 foreign-funded enterprises of the 
three types, which involved $4.27 billion in foreign investment. 
Tianjin directly used $541 million of foreign capital in 1993, 
up 130 percent. 
  The development zone, bonded zone, and district and county 
small development zones developed more rapidly. In 1993, the 
development zone signed contracts on 909 foreign-funded 
enterprises of the three types, and the contracted amount of 
foreign investment totaled $1.236 billion, up 96.8 and 76.5 
percent, respectively, from the preceding year. The industrial 
output value of the development zone was 7.025 billion yuan in 
the year, and its export $292 million, up 120 and 82.5 percent, 
respectively, from the preceding year. The area of the bonded 
zone was expanded from 1.2 square km to 5 square km. It signed 
contracts on 1,221 foreign-funded enterprises of the three types 
in 1993, foreign investment involved in the contracts was $552 
million, and the goods imported and exported from the zone since 
it was put into operation was valued at $1.06 billion. The 12 
district and county small development zones developed 
vigorously. They signed contracts on 339 foreign-funded 
enterprises of the three types in 1993, and the amount of 
foreign investment involved was $209 million. 
  Further development was made in import and export trade. 
The total value of imports and exports through the Tianjin 
Customs Office in 1993 reached $12.504 billion and showed a 20 
percent increase over 1992. Of the total value, that of imports 
reached $5.901 billion and showed an 18 percent increase over 
1992 while exports reached $6.603 billion and showed a 29 
percent increase over 1992. The role of the municipal harbor 
was further brought into play. The increase scored in the 
municipal exports of foreign trade was somewhat accelerated. 
The annual total value of foreign-trade exports reached $1.928 
billion and showed a 10.9 percent increase over 1992. This has 
been the fastest growth in this regard over the past five years. 
The "three types of foreign- funded enterprises" have become an 
important force in broadening the municipal exports. These 
enterprises exported commodities worth $420 million that showed 
a 90.8 percent increase over 1992. The proportion of their 
exported commodities in foreign trade in the total volume of the 
municipal foreign-trade exports increased from 13.1 percent in 
1992 to 22.5 percent in 1993. 
  Economic and technical cooperation with foreign countries 
achieved obvious progress and development. The municipality 
newly signed contracts worth $190.26 million on construction 
projects and labor cooperation with foreign countries in the 
year. It honored contracts worth $102.449 million that showed 
an 83 percent increase over 1992. 
  The regional economy achieved faster development and the 
economic results scored by setting up economic associations with 
domestic localities and by bringing in foreign funds were 
obvious. The municipality signed contracts for 11,420 projects 
on economic and technical cooperation in the year and honored 
the contracts of 11,357 projects. Of these projects, 827 are 
for economic cooperation in which 10,336 talented personnel were 
exchanged. Fraternal provinces and cities established 478 
offices or economic entities in the municipality in 1993. Thus, 
the municipal radiation network affecting both domestic 
localities and foreign countries was broadened. The total 
investments made in opening business firms, engaging in 
large-scale land development, and building infrastructures in 
the municipality, through the projects of economic associations 
and the introduction of foreign capital, were worth 967 million 
yuan. 
  The international tourism achieved faster development. The 
municipality received 135,000 international tourists in 1993, 
which showed a 23.5 percent increase over 1992. The 
foreign-exchange incomes earned from the tourist business were 
worth 372 million yuan Renminbi and showed a 31.5 percent 
increase over 1992. 
<H5>  5. Communications, Transportation, and Post and </H5>
Telecommunication 
  Along with having accelerated economic development, the 
municipality further achieved development in the undertakings of 
transportation as well as of post and telecommunication. The 
volume of airway transport and harbor loading and unloading 
increased on a large scale. The annual increased value of 
undertakings in transportation as well as in post and 
telecommunication reached 4.26 billion yuan and showed a 14.7 
percent increase over 1992. 
  The volume scored by various transportation means was as
