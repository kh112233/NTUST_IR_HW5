  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, March 7, (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
is prepared for any possible retaliation by Britain to its 
decision to ban British companies from new government contracts, 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Sunday. However, he 
added, it would be very unfortunate if the British government 
adopted retaliatory measures because the Malaysian action was 
not directed at the British Government. Abdullah made the 
statement after British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
reportedly indicated that the British Government might take 
retaliatory measures. [passage omitted] 
  We are not hasty in our action against the allegations but 
we 
cannot allow the British media to publish baseless statements, 
he told reporters after presenting Id festival aid to poor 
people in the northern Penang state. Abdullah said Malaysian 
leaders had to defend their dignity by taking action owing to 
the allegations by influential newspapers in Britain. 
  The action by the Malaysian Government resulted from the 
attitude of the Western media which forced the country to act, 
he said. Abdullah said the government would wait and see what 
action the British Government would take in the matter. 
  Any action by the British Government should be directed at 
the media which brought about this problem between the two 
countries and should not be a retaliation against this country, 
he said. He said that if the British Government took retaliatory 
measures against Malaysia, bilateral relations would be strained 
and subsequently Britain would be the loser.
