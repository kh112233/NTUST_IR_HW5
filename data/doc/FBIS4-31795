  [Text] Prague June 11 (CTK) -- "While the United States 
decided only this week to compensate American veterans from the 
Gulf War, the Czech Army paid compensation to a soldier from the 
Gulf of Persia several months ago," today's issue of the 
independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES writes. Czech authorities 
paid compensation to the soldier after a long-term investigation 
of his individual complaints, before the U.S. Senate published a 
report saying that there existed unchallengeable proofs of the 
use of chemical and maybe even biological substances in the war 
against Iraq, the paper writes. 
  Doctors had found out in him the so-called hepatitis 
positive 
Australian antigen, and concluded that his condition was related 
to his participation in the war. The officer of the 
Czechoslovak anti-chemical unit has no longer been a career 
soldier. 
  Fifteen or so soldiers have turned to the Army's Health 
Administration, complaining of various health problems. "The 
connection between their complaints and the Gulf fighting is 
still being investigated," the paper says.
