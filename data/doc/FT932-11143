FT  05 MAY 93 / UN seeks funds for Mozambican exiles
THE United Nations yesterday launched an appeal to send 1.3m refugees back
to Mozambique in Africa's largest ever voluntary repatriation programme,
Reuter reports from Geneva.
The Dollars 203m sought from donor states will finance a three-year
programme, which officials hope to begin by late June.
The funds will be used by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) to buy food and seeds for planting, hire trucks to transfer the
refugees, and rebuild roads, bridges and schools. Up to Dollars 6m of the
funds will be used to remove landmines from the country.
A total of 1.8m refugees are believed to have fled civil war in Mozambique,
which caused Dollars 15bn in damage and left 3m dead before it ended last
year.
A peace accord and the easing of a severe drought have already encouraged
150,000 refugees to return, according to the UNHCR. The Geneva-based UN
agency expects to repatriate another 500,000 this year at a cost of Dollars
55m.
'The refugees are very eager to come home,' said Mr David Lambo, UNHCR
co-ordinator for southern Africa. 'They are waiting to see if the peace
situation is really going to stick. Mozambique is a key to bringing peace
and prosperity to the whole region,' he said.
Malawi is sheltering 1.1m of the 1.3m Mozambican refugees registered with
the UNHCR. Zimbabwe is home to 138,000, followed by Zambia, Swaziland and
Tanzania with 20,000-25,000 each.
In addition, South Africa is believed to have 250,000 unregistered
Mozambicans, Zimbabwe a further 100,000 and Tanzania another 50,000, the
agency said.
'The slow implementation of the peace process, the fragile economic
situation, the presence of millions of displaced and hungry people, and the
estimated 2m mines are among the major obstacles UNHCR faces,' it said.
