  [Text] Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has sent 
a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to 
promote the visit of U.S. tourists to Guatemala, saying the 
recent acts of violence against two U.S. citizens were "isolated 
incidents." 
  Due to those acts of violence, the U.S. Government has 
issued 
a travel warning [previous two words in English] advising 
travelers not to visit Guatemala or to postpone their trips to 
that country, except for emergency purposes. 
  Consequently, the important flow of U.S. tourists has 
dropped 
considerably, and hotels, travel agencies, and other 
tourist-related services have reported losses and have demanded 
stronger actions by the police. 
  In his letter to Christopher, de Leon expressed regret over 
and condemned the events and ensured the courts will "act 
strongly against the culprits who have already been arrested."
