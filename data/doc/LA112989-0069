N.Y. SUBWAY TRAIN HITS 2 MEN, KILLING THEM 
Two young men were struck by a train and killed early Tuesday, apparently as 
they were writing graffiti, police said. 
Cans of spray paint were found near the bodies at the 59th Street subway 
station, Transit Police Officer Joseph Ciociola said. The victims were about 50 
feet south of a waiting platform. 
The train's motorman said he did not see the men as he pulled into the station, 
but the train braked automatically upon impact, Ciociola said.
