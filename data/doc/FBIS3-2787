  [Text] Beijing, March 12 (AFP) -- Two American journalists 
have been released after being held by police for six hours 
after interviewing the wife of a Chinese dissident, Western 
reporters said Saturday. 
  Nick Driver, of the US news agency UPI, and Matthew Forney, 
a 
correspondent with Newsweek magazine, were stopped by six 
uniformed police at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) Friday as they left the 
home of the wife of dissident Liu Nianchun, 46, in the west of 
the capital. 
  Police said their car had collided with a telegraph pole 
when 
they parked their vehicle, bringing down telephone lines. The 
journalists did not deny this. But then about 30 police took 
turns interrogating them separately about their connection with 
the dissident and their conversation with his wife. 
  Before the Americans' release early Saturday at about 2 a.m. 
(1800 GMT Friday), police made them sign a document in which 
they agreed not to report what occurred during the course of the 
night. 
  The incident took place as US Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher was on an official visit to Beijing for talks on 
human rights. It also coincided with a crackdown by police 
against dissidents and activists which began at the start of the 
month. 
  According to a Human Rights Watch/Asia report Friday, Liu, 
who was jailed for three years in the 1980s, was one of those 
briefly detained and "may be in imminent danger of arrest." 
Liu, a longtime pro-democracy activist, called at the start of 
the week for the formation of an independent trade union, The 
League for the Protection of Working People. 
  The union's charter focuses on some of the negative 
consequences of rapid economic growth and calls, among other 
things, for the restoration of the right to strike and for the 
legalisation of independent workers' and peasant labour unions. 
  Liu is also a signatory of the Peace Charter issued by 
several dissidents in October 1993.
