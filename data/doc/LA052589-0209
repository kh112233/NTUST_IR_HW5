CORNELL SUSPENDS COMPUTER HACKER 
Cornell University has suspended a graduate student who created a computer 
"virus" that jammed a nationwide computer network last year, it was reported 
today. 
Robert Tappan Morris, 23, was informed in a May 16 letter by the dean of the 
Cornell University Graduate School that the university's Academic Integrity 
Hearing Board recommended that he be suspended until the fall semester of 1990, 
the New York Times said. 
The virus entered about 6,000 computers at universities, corporations and 
military installations last November and replicated itself until systems 
nationwide were jammed.
