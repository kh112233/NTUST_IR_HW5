A. Regulatory History



In accordance with 21 CFR 10.85, Calgene, Inc., submitted to FDA on November 26, 1990, a request for advisory opinion
regarding whether the 

kan

r

 gene, a selectable marker, may be used in the production of genetically engineered tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape
plants intended for human food and animal feed uses (

kan

r

 Gene: Safety and use in the production of genetically engineered plants, Docket Number 90A0416). In the 

Federal Register

 of May 1, 1991 (56 FR 20004), FDA announced that the request had been received and solicited comments from interested
persons. The data submitted to the agency with the request for advisory opinion and the comments received were made
available to the public at the Dockets Management Branch.

Subsequent to the submission of the request for advisory opinion, FDA published its ``Statement of Policy: Foods
Derived From New Plant Varieties'' (the 1992 policy statement) in the 

Federal Register

 of May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22984). This policy statement clarified FDA's interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (the act) with respect to human foods and animal feeds derived from new plant varieties, including plants
developed by new methods of genetic modification such as recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques.

In the 1992 policy statement, FDA stated that the postmarket authority under section 402(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C.
342(a)(1)) would continue to be the primary legal tool for ensuring the safety of whole foods derived from genetically
modified plants. FDA also noted that under the statutory definition of ``food additive'' in section 201(s) of the
act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the transferred genetic material and the intended expression products could be subject to
regulation as food additives, if such material or expression products were not generally recognized as safe (GRAS)
(57 FR 22984 at 22990). FDA further stated that the agency would use its food additive authority to the extent necessary
to ensure public health protection (such as when an intended expression product in a food differs significantly in
structure, function, or composition from substances found currently in food) (57 FR 22984 at 22990).

The 1992 policy statement specifically discussed selectable markers that provide antibiotic resistance in product
selection and development. With such markers, both the antibiotic resistance gene and the gene product, unless removed,
are expected to be present in foods derived from such plants. FDA stated:






Selectable marker genes that produce enzymes that inactivate clinically useful antibiotics theoretically may
reduce the therapeutic efficacy of the antibiotic when taken orally if the enzyme in the food inactivates the antibiotic.
FDA believes that it will be important to evaluate such concerns with respect to commercial use of antibiotic resistance
marker genes in food, especially those that will be widely used.






(See 57 FR 22984 at 22988.)






Subsequently, in January 1993, Calgene requested that FDA convert its request for advisory opinion to a food additive
petition under section 409 of the act. FDA then announced in the 

Federal Register

 of July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38429), that a food additive petition (FAP 3A4364) had been filed by Calgene, Inc., 1920 Fifth
St., Davis, CA 95616, proposing that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of APH(3
&rsquo;)II as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton.

After completing its review of the data submitted by Calgene, FDA convened a public meeting of its Food Advisory Committee
on April 6 through 8, 1994, to undertake a scientific discussion of the agency's approach to evaluating the safety
of whole foods produced by new biotechnologies; a genetically modified tomato developed by Calgene containing the


kan

r

 gene served as an example and focus of the discussion. The membership of the standing committee was supplemented with
temporary members and consultants to the committee, representing scientific disciplines appropriate to the evaluation
of foods derived from new plant varieties developed using recombinant DNA techniques.

At the meeting, Calgene presented a summary of the data they considered adequate to show safety of the tomato, and FDA
presented its evaluation of the data. The committee was asked to comment on the approach used by FDA to evaluate whole
foods and specifically, on the approach used for the Calgene tomato (Ref. 1). During committee discussion of the Calgene
and FDA presentations, the committee members generally expressed the view that the approach used by FDA to evaluate
the safety of the tomato, including the safety of the 

kan

r

 gene, was appropriate and that all relevant scientific questions had been adequately addressed.
