IRAN AND IRAQ AGREE TO EXCHANGE 8,000 PRISONERS DAILY 
Iran and Iraq have agreed to increase the number of prisoners of war being 
released under their Persian Gulf War peace initiative from 1,000 on each side 
each day to 8,000, the Iranian news agency IRNA said Sunday. 
The International Committee of the Red Cross, which is insisting on 
interviewing each prisoner to make certain that he wants to return home, said 
in Geneva that it is sending more staff to Iran and Iraq to allow the prisoner 
exchange to speed up. 
But it declined to estimate how many prisoners a day it would now be able to 
process. 
Both countries, impatient to see their people free after eight years of 
devastating war and two years of inconclusive diplomacy, urged the Red Cross on 
Saturday to send more staff. The exchange started Friday and so far 3,000 
Iranians and 2,000 Iraqis have been freed. 
The Red Cross has registered 50,000 Iranian prisoners of war and 20,000 Iraqis, 
but it estimates that there could be up to 15,000 more Iranian prisoners and 
20,000 more Iraqis.
