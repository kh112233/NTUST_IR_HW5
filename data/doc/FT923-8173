FT  13 AUG 92 / Pounds 80m station plan for Channel tunnel
BRITISH RAIL publicised fresh plans yesterday for an international railway
station at Ashford, Kent, to serve Continental trains passing through the
Channel tunnel.
If the government approves the scheme, the Pounds 80m station should provide
people in south-east England with a way of joining Channel tunnel expresses
without having to travel into central London.
Plans for the station have met a series of delays. Last October, Eurotunnel,
the company building the Channel tunnel, tried to embarrass the government
into hastening construction by devising a Pounds 4m temporary solution using
prefabricated huts. Two months later, the Department of Transport threw out
BR's plans for a Pounds 140m scheme on the grounds of expense.
BR's new and less ambitious scheme, presented to Kent County Council
yesterday, would expand the existing Network SouthEast station to
accommodate international and domestic trains, and give it an international
departure lounge and 2,000-space carpark.
If the government provides money for the station in this autumn's public
spending round, it should open in 1994. Given the delays to the construction
of Channel tunnel express trains, it may yet appear in time to serve the
first Continental services.
Services from the station would go to, among other places, Lille, Paris,
Brussels, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Cologne.
