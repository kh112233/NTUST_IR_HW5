Marine Mammals 



AGENCIES:

 The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), 
Department of Defense in cooperation with National Marine 
Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA), Commerce. 




<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact 
statement and request for comment. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The ARPA, in cooperation with the NMFS, intends to 
prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS), according to the 
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), on an application for a 
scientific research permit to allow harassment of marine mammals 
and sea turtles by a low frequency sound source, and to monitor 
the effects thereof. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments are requested by June 15, 1994. The public 
hearing and scoping meeting will be held on May 16, 1994.

ADDRESSES:

 Comments and requests for additional information 
should be addressed to: Ralph W. Alewine, III, Ph.D., Director, 
Advanced Research Projects Agency, NMRO, 3701 North Fairfax 
Drive, Arlington, VA 222031714, (703) 6962246. The public 
hearing and scoping meeting will held at the Santa Cruz Civic 
Auditorium, 307 Church Street, Santa Cruz, CA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 An application for a scientific 
research permit has been submitted by Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, Institute for Geophysics and Planetary Physics, 
Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) Program, 9500 Gilman 
Drive, La Jolla, CA 920930225. The applicant is requesting 
authorization to take (by harassment) several species of 
cetaceans, pinnipeds, and sea turtles in California coastal 
waters, during a study designed to assess the effects of low 
frequency sound associated with the ATOC program on marine 
mammals and sea turtles. The proposed research is a pilot 
project which is intended to provide information which can be 
used in assessing the potential environmental effects of 
continuing the ATOC program in a broader context. If a decision 
is made to continue funding for the broader ATOC program, any 
potential environmental effects will be assessed in a separate 
environmental analysis. 



The subject research was proposed to be conducted in 
California waters from April 1994 through March 1996. As 
currently proposed, the sound source will be located due west of 
Pt. Sur, California at 850950 m depth. The maximum duty cycle 
will be 8%, with a transmission bandwidth of 20 Hz at a level of 
195 dB (re 1 &mu;Pa at 1m), and with a spectrum level for the center 
frequency (70 Hz) at 182 dB. The effects of these transmissions 
on marine mammals and sea turtles will be monitored through the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA)
of 1972, as 
amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 

et seq.

), the Regulations Governing the 
Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the 
Endangered Species Act (EIS) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 


et seq

.), the regulations governing the taking, importing, and exporting of endangered fish and wildlife (50 CFR part 222),

the Fur Seal Act of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1151 

et seq.

), 
and fur seal regulations at 50 CFR part 215. ARPA and NMFS invite 
interested parties to participate in determining the scope of 
significant issues to be addressed in the EIS. Significant 
issues currently under consideration by ARPA and NMFS are: the 
potential effects of the proposed low frequency sound source on 
marine mammals, sea turtles, and other marine resources, 
including fish; alternatives with respect to site selection; and, 
as a related issue, the purpose of the ATOC program, and an 
evaluation thereof as compared to other possible alternatives for 
assessing global warming. ARPA and NMFS will also consider as 
part of the scoping process, comments received at a public 
hearing to be held in California on May 16, 1994, from 5 p.m. to 
10 p.m. at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, 307 Church Street, 
Santa Cruz, California co-sponsored with the Monterey Bay 
National Marine Sanctuary. The period from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. will be allotted for the applicant to provide a brief description
of an udpated research program. Upon completion of a draft EIS on the proposed application, ARPA and NMFS will solicit
public comments on it, as well.
