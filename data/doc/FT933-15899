FT  07 JUL 93 / Attali set to get Pounds 147,000 payoff
MR Jacques Attali, who is resigning as president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, is likely to receive a tax-free payoff of
more than Pounds 147,000.
Mrs Anne Wibble, chairman of the bank's governors who was in London
yesterday to discuss Mr Attali's compensation arrangements and procedures
for finding his successor, said she expected Mr Attali to receive a year's
salary as an allowance for termination of employment.
Mr Attali's letter of appointment says his 'annual net base salary' is
Pounds 147,000. Mr Attali has had a pay rise since then. 'It seems clear it
(the payoff) will be paid,' she said.
Mr Attali resigned on June 25, following months of criticism of expenditure
by the bank.
Mr Attali's letter of appointment says he is entitled to 'a termination
allowance equivalent to one year's net base salary' unless the bank's
governors terminate his contract 'for cause'.
Mrs Wibble, Sweden's finance minister, said a decision on whether to pay Mr
Attali the termination allowance would therefore depend on the outcome of
the investigation into alleged overspending at the bank.
She said Mr Attali would remain at the bank until a new president arrived,
which she hoped could be in September. Governors, representing the
governments of 54 countries and agencies which own the bank, have until July
21 to nominate candidates and the election period lasts 21 days from then.
Bank executives and directors believe that Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor
of the Bank of France, will succeed Mr Attali.
