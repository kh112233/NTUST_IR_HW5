Efforts to produce power from nuclear fusion are the subject of Horizon
(8.10 BBC2). Four months ago the Joint European Torus in Oxfordshire became
the first scientific project to produce more than one megawatt of power from
a controlled fusion reaction. Now a huge experiment is being planned with
collaboration between the USA, Europe, Russia and Japan. If it goes ahead it
is expected to cost Pounds 3bn and take 12 years to build. Meanwhile, in the
US, techniques derived from weapons research are being tried as a means of
achieving fusion via miniature versions of the H-bomb.
Cutting Edge (9.00 C4) investigates the evidence used to convict three
leading members of the Black Panthers and suggests that they were victims of
a conspiracy between the FBI and the police. Somehow it all sounds eerily
familiar.
BBC1 begins a three-part dramatisation of the novel about a crowd of old
drinkers in South Wales which won Kingsley Amis the Booker Prize: The Old
Devils (9.30). The adaptation is by Andrew Davies, who wrote the brilliant
comedy drama series 'A Very Peculiar Practice'.
