FT  06 JAN 93 / US stops BP deal with Iran
THE BUSH administration yesterday blocked the proposed sale of controversial
chemicals plant technology to Iran by the US chemicals subsidiary of British
Petroleum (BP).
The rejection, which caught both BP and the State Department by surprise,
was announced by Mr Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's press secretary.
It followed reports yesterday that US government agencies remained divided
about the proposed sale because of concerns that Iran might be able to
develop chemical weapons with a hydrogen cyanide by-product of the BP
technology.
In Cleveland, Ohio, BP's US chemicals company said BP had not been notified
of any decision.
Mr Fitzwater said the decision to reject the sale to Iran had been taken a
month ago. But a state department official said he understood the BP
proposal and a separate US company proposal to sell aircraft for crop
dusting to Iran had both been scheduled for further discussion yesterday at
an inter-agency meeting. The State Department said, however, it would defer
to the White House on the issue.
Mr Tony Kozlowski of BP's US chemicals company said the company was first
approached 18 months ago by Fibchem, an Iranian fibre chemicals company.
He said BP subsequently consulted various US government agencies and was
told that there were no objections to the sale from the Commerce, Energy and
Defence Departments or from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
