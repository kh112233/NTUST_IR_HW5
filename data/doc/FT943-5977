FT  01 SEP 94 / People: World Bank's new spin doctor
Mark Malloch Brown, 40, a former journalist on The Economist, has been given
the job of repairing the image of the Washington-based World Bank, which is
celebrating its fiftieth anniversary this year.
A British national who created and edited The Economist Development Report,
he has been appointed director of external affairs, reporting to World Bank
president Lewis Preston. He replaces Alexander Shakow who becomes senior
adviser in the Bank's operations policy department.
The Bank has come under increasing attack over the last couple of years.
Those on the right argue that the markets can take over its role as investor
in developing countries. Others argue that the Bank's programmes have hurt
rather than helped the poor. The decline in the Bank's image has been partly
blamed on its inability to get its message across.
Malloch Brown's media skills have been honed in some of the world's toughest
trouble spots. During his time with the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees he was responsible for establishing camps for Cambodian refugees.
Other jobs have included advising the presidential campaigns of Cory Aquino
in the Philippines and Mario Vargas Llosa in Peru.
He currently heads the international practice of Robinson Lake Sawyer
Miller, a Washington political consultancy.
