FT  25 JAN 93 / Currencies to split soon
THE Czechoslovak currency will be split into separate Czech and Slovak
crowns 'within a few days', a senior adviser to the Czech central bank told
the Czech news agency CTK at the weekend, writes Patrick Blum from Prague.
At a conference of German and Czech businessmen in Coburg, Bavaria, Mr
Vladimir Jindra, adviser to the central bank governor, also forecast the new
Czech crown would be fully convertible in two years.
Changing crowns into hard currency is subject to strict limitations, but
uncertainty about the money's future has led to a rush for foreign exchange
both on the official and black markets.
The crown was not to be split until the summer but analysts expect this to
happen much sooner. A spokesman for the central bank said yesterday that no
date had been set and the timing would require agreement between both
central banks.
