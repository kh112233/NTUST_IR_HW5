  [Text] Moscow, 13 Jan (TASS) -- Russia's Choice is the 
largest faction in the State Duma. It has 76 deputies. The new 
regional policy group that was the first to be registered has 65 
deputies. The Liberal Democratic Party earned 63 seats in 
parliament, the Agrarian Party 55, the Communist Party 45. 
  There are four smaller parliamentary factions: The groups of 
the Party of Russian Unity and Accord with 30 seats; the Yabloko 
Party with 25 seats; the Women of Russia with 23 seats; and the 
Democratic Party of Russia with 15 seats. 
  The preliminary alignment of political forces in the State 
Duma indicates that communists, agrarians, and members of 
Zhirinovskiy's party have a total of 163 seats and are short of 
a parliamentary majority. The new regional policy group is 
likely to become influential in the lower chamber of parliament. 
Its composition, mostly centrists, are likely to consolidate 
the positions now of the right wing, now of the left. Many 
factions are likely to compete for friendship with this powerful 
group, which includes major industrialists and regional leaders 
elected in one-seat constituencies.
