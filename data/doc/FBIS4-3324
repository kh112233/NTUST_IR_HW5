  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (AFP) -- Beijing rejected 
Wednesday Britain's request for clemency for jailed Hong Kong 
journalist Xi Yang, saying the affair was China's "internal 
affair" and that his sentence was "appropriate." 
  "Chinese judicial departments' trial of Xi Yang according to 
law is China's internal affair," a foreign ministry spokeswoman 
said when asked for Beijing's response to British Ambassador to 
China Robin MacLaren's appeal Tuesday for clemency. 
  "In light of the facts of the crime committed by Xi Yang, 
the 
sentence given to him by our judicial department is 
appropriate," she said, referring to the 12-year term passed 
down on the MING PAO newspaper reporter in a secret trial in 
March for allegedly stealing state secrets. 
  The appeal by 38-year-old Xi against the heavy sentence was 
briskly rejected by a court here last week, sparking large 
protests in Hong Kong amid concern over press freedom after the 
British territory's reversion to Chinese rule in 1997. 
  The United States has also added its voice to the protests, 
with the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong issuing a statement Tuesday 
saying Xi's sentence was "far out of proportion to the acts he 
allegedly committed." 
  The journalist's arrest followed the publication of a report 
on Chinese financial and banking policy, which the Beijing court 
ruled was based on secret documents illegally obtained by Xi 
from a Chinese bank employee. 
  The bank employee has been jailed for 15 years. 
  In Hong Kong, a spokesman for MING PAO dismissed the 
Chinese foreign ministry's remarks, saying the ministry is "not 
in a position to decide." 
  "According to the Chinese constitution, the standing 
committee of the National People's Congress has the power to 
decide on clemency appeals," he said. 
  The spokesman added that the newspaper had yet to decide 
whether to make a formal appeal.
