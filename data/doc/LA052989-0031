IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
MELANOMA GENE IDENTIFIED 
Scientists researching melanoma reported Thursday that they have found a gene 
responsible for a hereditary form of the deadly skin cancer associated with 
abnormal skin moles. 
The gene is associated with dysplastic nevi, larger-than-normal moles that 
change color or shape and are prone to becoming cancerous. 
Up to 12% of cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma occur in people whose 
families are also prone to the cancer and usually in association with the 
abnormal moles. 
The scientists, headed by Sherri Bale of the National Cancer Institute in 
Bethesda, Md., located the gene in members of six families susceptible to 
melanoma. 
Using molecular genetic techniques and gene linkage analyses, the scientists 
found the gene near the end of the upper arm of chromosome 1 -- the largest of 
the 46 chromosomes in human beings.
