COLOMBIA SEIZES 9 BOGOTA CARTEL MEMBERS 
Police swept across the capital on anti-drug raids and captured nine suspected 
members of the cocaine cartel based here, including a top member wanted in the 
United States, authorities said Friday. 
The suspect, Jesus Emilio Zapata, and the eight other alleged members of the 
Bogota cartel were arrested in one of 20 raids in the capital Thursday. It is 
not known if the Bogota cartel has been operating in cooperation with the 
country's Medellin or Cali cartels.
