  [Text] Nippon Steel Corporation [NSC] and other major 
Japanese steel makers plan to start full-scale exports of 
half-finished steel products to the United States beginning 
early next year. This is to respond to the shortage of steel 
materials in the United States, where the demand for steel is 
increasing with the economy's recovery. It is expected that the 
export volume will be about 400,000 tons in the first half of 
next year. The steel exports do not yield much profit, but 
Japanese makers seem to have no choice but to export them 
because the demand at home has dropped greatly. 
  They will export billet to be rolled into thin steel sheets 
and formed steel products. U.S. steel makers will process the 
billet into thin steel sheets to be used for car production and 
other purposes. Japanese steel makers exported about 100,000 
tons of steel a year to the United States in the late eighties 
despite the appreciation of the yen at the time. Recently, the 
volume of exports has fallen to about 1,000 tons. 
  As automobiles are selling satisfactorily, steel materials 
for the production of cars are now in short supply in the United 
States. In the latter half of the year, U.S. steel makers began 
to give orders for steel materials to Japanese counterparts one 
after another. 
  In Japan, the volume of crude steel production in the 
January-March period is expected to be 21.45 million tons, the 
smallest figure in 25 years. Considering the decrease in steel 
demand very serious at home, Japanese steel makers have decided 
to export to the United States. Although major steel makers are 
continuously promoting the reduction of production, they cannot 
cut back operations beyond certain limits. 
  Besides exports to the United States, the NSC will also 
export pig iron for casting production to electric furnace steel 
makers in South Korea and Taiwan.
