  [Text] Beijing, December 30 (XINHUA) -- China has 
maintained the high-speed growth momentum of its tourist 
industry this year, which earned record sums of foreign 
currencies. 
  The industry welcomed a total of 40 million overseas 
tourists 
and reaped a record 4.6 billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange 
by the end of the year, up 4.9 percent and 16.5 percent 
respectively over the 1992 figure. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, a high-ranking official of the 
State Administration of Tourism said that China now ranks 17th 
in the world in terms of foreign exchange earnings from tourism, 
dramatically up from the 41st place 15 years ago. 
  To ensure steady growth in the booming tourism, the 
government has urged the country's tourism institutions and 
agencies to take harsh measures next year to curb random charges 
on overseas tourists surcharged by guides and drivers who 
pressurize tourists into shopping and thus receive commissions. 
  The official said that the government will strictly forbid 
hotels and restaurants catering for foreigners to receive sales 
commission or brokerage of any kind through dealing with tourist 
groups. They should supply the exact food to the tourists as 
ordered under the contract. No unauthorized changes should be 
made in the diet. 
  The official said that the relevant departments should also 
pay great attention to improving toilet sanitation at scenic 
spots, about which overseas tourists complain most. 
  Moreover, according to the official, the relevant government 
departments will take tougher and more effective measures to 
crack down on such illegal activities as prostitution, gambling 
and drug taking, and to punish severely people who connive at 
such behavior. 
  As for Chinese citizens who are to go abroad for 
sightseeing, 
the state tourism departments will map out plans for such 
visits, the official added.
