FT  23 OCT 93 / Hurd backs government decision on Malaysian aid project
MR DOUGLAS HURD said yesterday that Britain had pressed ahead with aid
funding for an uneconomical hydroelectric plant in Malaysia because of
commitments made by Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, and fears that to
renege on the contract 'would have been very damaging to trade'.
In a vigorous defence of a government decision to provide Pounds 234m in aid
funding for a hydro-power project on the Pergau river in Malaysia, the
foreign secretary admitted he had overridden advice from civil servants that
the project would be 'a very bad buy' and a burden on Malaysian consumers.
He said in an interview with the BBC World Service during the Commonwealth
heads of government meeting in Cyprus that he had disagreed with advice from
the Overseas Development Administration, which manages Britain's aid budget.
'I had to take account of something they did not have to take account of,'
he said. 'An undertaking had been given at the highest level that we would
proceed with this project. The damage of backtracking on that understanding
reached at the highest level would have been very great.'
He was referring to a high-profile visit to Malaysia in 1988 by Lady
Thatcher which brought to an end a decade-long 'Buy British Last' policy in
Malaysia.
A Pounds 1bn defence supply agreement was negotiated personally by Lady
Thatcher with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister. Malaysia's
defence shopping list at the time amounted to Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn), an
official involved in the negotiations said yesterday.
Controversy over the contract erupted on Thursday when a National Audit
Office report strongly criticised the government's support of the project,
saying it 'would result in Malaysian consumers paying over Pounds 100m more
for electricity over its 35-year life than if the money were invested in an
alternative'.
