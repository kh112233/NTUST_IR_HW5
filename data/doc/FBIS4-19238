  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The radical right-wing 
Republikaner (REP) party is showing signs of efforts toward 
right-wing extremism. This emerges from the 1993 report by the 
Office for the Protection of the Constitution, which was 
submitted today in Bonn by Interior Minister Manfred Kanther. 
Statements by leading Republikaner representatives indicated 
right-wing extremist efforts in contravention of the basic 
freedom-based democratic order, the report said. According to 
the report, the Republikaner have 16 regional associations 
throughout Germany, comprising 23,000 members. 
  The number of organized and nonorganized right-wing 
extremists in Germany has scarcely changed compared with last 
year, according to the report. In 1993 there were 41,500. 
There are also 650 neo-Nazis belonging to groups that have now 
been banned, as well as another 300 who are not in organized 
groups. Compared with 1992, acts of violence motivated by 
xenophobia decreased by about 30 percent in 1993. In 1993, 
1,609 such acts of violence were registered, while in 1992 there 
were 2,277. However, the number of other offenses such as 
threats or provocation rose from 2,731 to 5,112. 
  The 1993 report by the Office for the Protection of the 
Constitution also says that the threat to internal security as a 
result of acts of violence by left-wing extremists was more 
serious in 1993 than in the previous year. Reference is made to 
the bomb attack on the new prison building in Weiterstadt near 
Darmstadt by the Red Army Faction (RAF) terrorist organization 
on 27 March 1993, and to the incident on 27 June 1993 in Bad 
Kleinen, when suspected RAF terrorist Wolfgang Grams was shot 
dead by the GSG-9 crack force. The left-wing extremist potential 
is prepared to use force chiefly consisted of anarchists. 
Membership of these groups is still growing. 
  In 1993, the trend emerging since 1988 of foreign extremists 
increasingly using violence to enforce their political 
objectives has continued. In that context, five people were 
killed. A large number of the acts of violence committed by 
foreign extremists were attributed to Kurdish and Turkish 
left-wing extremist groups. The number of members of Kurdish 
organizations is estimated to be 6,900 (1992:4,850).
