  [Text] Durban May 2 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he telephoned African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela on Monday [2 May] evening to 
congratulate him on the ANC victory in the National Assembly in 
South Africa's first all-race election. Mr Mandela referred in 
his victory speech in Johannesburg on Monday night to telephone 
calls from National Party leader President F W de Klerk, Freedom 
Front leader Gen Constand Viljoen and the Pan Africanist 
Congress leadership, in which they pledged their support. 
  He made no reference to the IFP leader and speculation began 
immediately on radio stations as to what this meant. 
  Mr Buthelezi said he telephoned Mr Mandela at 5.45PM on 
Monday.
