ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 
BURGLARY SUSPECT FOUND ATOP ROOF 
Police cordoned off a residential neighborhood early Sunday and used a 
helicopter and dogs to conduct a yard-by-yard search for a suspected auto 
burglar, who was eventually found hiding atop a roof. 
The suspect, Donald Owen McClure, 29, of Newport Beach, was booked on suspicion 
of vehicle tampering, petty theft and assault on a police officer. 
Bail was set at $10,000. 
Police Sgt. Karl Schuller said he was on routine patrol at about 1:40 a.m. 
Sunday when he saw the suspect trying to steal the taillight off a car parked 
in the 200 block of East 17th Street. 
The suspect struggled as Schuller tried to arrest him, cutting the officer over 
the eye, and fled, Schuller said. Schuller chased the suspect for 500 yards but 
had to give up after twisting his ankle, he said. 
Schuller was taken to a local hospital, where he was treated and released. 
Other police officers, meanwhile, cordoned off the neighborhood and searched 
for two hours before finding the suspect on a roof. JIM CARLTON
