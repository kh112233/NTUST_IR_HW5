  [Text] Taipei, March 9 (CNA) -- Taiwan will most likely be 
hit with sanctions by the United States and the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) for alleged 
poor performance in wildlife protection, according to Ted Ting, 
head of the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation (BTF). 
  Ting, who is visiting several wildlife protection groups in 
Washington D.C., said in a message to BTF headquarters Wednesday 
[9 March] that there seems to be a consensus among US and CITES 
officials to "sanction Taiwan first and keep the Chinese 
mainland on the watch list." 
  Ting said that the international community seems to be 
losing 
patience over Taiwan's inability to crack down on alleged 
illegal trade in rhino horns and tiger bone. 
  Besides, he added, they are also upset with Taipei's failure 
to keep its promise to submit amendments to its Wildlife 
Protection Law to the Legislative Yuan for approval by the end 
of February. 
  The US and CITES have several times turned down requests by 
non- governmental organizations to impose sanction against 
Taiwan. 
  But now, Ting said, they believe Taiwan is not serious about 
improving its wildlife protection record. 
  In related news, Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung of the 
Council 
of Agriculture said Wednesday that his council will send the 
revised Wildlife Protection Law to the legislature March 20.
