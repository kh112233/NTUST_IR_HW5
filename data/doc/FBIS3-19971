  [Text] Bonn -- The state secretaries of the federal and 
laender Interior Ministries have agreed to use more severe 
measures against the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), following 
the recent riots. After a three-hour meeting, Kurt Schelter, 
state secretary in the Federal Interior Ministry, said on 
Wednesday [23 March] evening that organizations replacing the 
banned PKK should be monitored and prevented with all suitable 
means. 
  Prosecution of the perpetrators is to concentrate on PKK 
ringleaders; demonstrations and marches are to be documented in 
detail; and proceedings for determining membership in a 
terrorist organization are to be instituted. In addition, labor 
exchange bureaus and trade supervisory authorities should search 
for people working illegally in order to deprive the PKK of its 
areas of retreat, Schelter said. All vandals should be deported, 
if possible. 
  The laender interior minister called on the Federal 
Government to ask Ankara to make sure that those deported do not 
face death penalties, torture, or inhuman treatment. The 
laender governed by the Social Democratic Party spoke out for 
halting German arms supplies to Turkey. Bavaria demanded a 
broader definition of breach of the public peace. This offense 
should also be laid down as a compelling reason for deportation 
in the law regarding foreigners.
