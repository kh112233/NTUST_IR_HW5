SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of July 17, 1990 (55 FR 29105), FDA announced that a petition (FAP 9B4171) had been filed by Chugai Boyeki (America)
Corp. (``Chugai'' was inadvertently misspelled in the filing notice as ``Chaugai''), 500 Fifth Ave., suite 1730,
New York, NY 10110. The petition proposed to amend the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of the addition
product of (C

C

) alkene and propylene to polymethyl hydrogensiloxane for use as a modifier and as an antifoaming agent for polyolefin
resin coatings for paper and paperboard.
 


 FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant material and concluded that the proposed use for the additive
in paper and paperboard coatings is safe. However, based upon a complete review of the petition, the agency has determined
that the appropriate technical effect of the additive is primarily as a polymer modifier, that effect is reflected
in the listing regulation. The agency has further determined that the Chemical Abstracts Service nomenclature and
registry number more accurately describe the additive than the description in the notice of filing, and therefore,
the agency has used them in this rule. Under this nomenclature, the additive is denominated ``Siloxanes (silicones),
dimethyl, isopropyl methyl, methyl 1-methyl-C

-alkyl.'' Accordingly, FDA concludes that the food additive regulations should be amended in 176.170 

Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods

 (21 CFR 176.170) as set forth below.
 In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
 The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. 
 Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before July 28, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
