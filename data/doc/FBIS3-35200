  [Text] An Iraqi delegation, led by Sa'd 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Faysal, under secretary at the Foreign Ministry, and an 
Iranian delegation, led by Mohammad Javad Zarif, assistant 
foreign minister for organizations affairs, held a round of 
talks in Tehran today. The talks centered on the release and 
return of all Iraqi POW's in Iran and on conducting searches for 
the missing. The talks also covered the issue of returning all 
Iraqi planes in Iran. Several technical committees from both 
sides were formed to study the various outstanding problems 
between Iraq and Iran. 
  The Iraqi delegation, headed by Sa'd 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Faysal, 
arrived in Tehran the day before yesterday on a visit to Iran. 
The visit is aimed at completing talks with the Iranian side, 
which were begun in Baghdad during Mohammad Javad Zarif's visit 
on 17 October. It is also to prepare for a meeting between the 
two countries' foreign ministers, planned to be held in Baghdad 
later this year.
