IRAQ FREES 238 IRANIAN POWS 
Iraq freed 238 Iranian prisoners and flew them to Tehran Wednesday as the two 
former Persian Gulf foes resumed exchanging captives after a two-month break, 
Tehran Radio reported. 
It said 179 Iraqi prisoners of war would return home later in the day on the 
return flight. The two nations earlier exchanged about 75,000 POWs. 
Iran held up to 70,000 Iraqi prisoners and Iraq 35,000 Iranians when a 
U.N.-brokered cease-fire ended eight years of war in August, 1988.
