<H5>  A. Overview </H5>
  An important key to the health and affluence of the 
long-lived society of the 21st century is to make the best use 
of the fruits of science and technology in improving the health 
and welfare of the people. In such anage, making the most of 
S&amp;T 
results relating to improving the quality of people's lifestyles 
while at the same time striving for harmony between science and 
humankind is essential. The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHW) 
grasps the concept of "health science" from such a point of view 
and strives to promote the fields of S&amp;T that can answer the 
needs of health care, welfare, hygiene, etc. 
  Although Japan's economic development has led to dramatic 
improvements in the people's way of life, it has also led to 
more complicated and diversified needs with respect to the 
S&amp;T 
fields over which the MHW has charge, i.e., health care, 
welfare, hygiene, etc. On the other hand, the remarkable S&amp;T 
developments centering on biotechnology and other such 
leading-edge technology fields point to many possibilities for 
improving people's lifestyles. In order to quickly and 
appropriately cope with the changes resulting from both these 
needs and seeds, a conventional centralized administration alone 
is inadequate in the fight against cancer, cardiovascular 
diseases, and incurable diseases. It is becoming essential for 
the MHW to implement its S&amp;T administration in a unitary and 
across-the-board fashion. 
  In order to cope with such a state of affairs, the MHW set 
up 
the Health Science Division, which handles the overall 
coordination and efficient execution of the MHW's S&amp;T 
measures. 
The FY93 budget needed to promote these S&amp;T measures is 
&yen;64.343 billion, which is an increase of &yen;3.005 billion 
(4.9&percnt;) over the FY92 budget. 
<H5>  B. Health Science Conferences </H5>
  In promoting "health science," a basic strategy must be 
established and studies must be conducted on setting 
future-oriented priority research topics that are based on that 
strategy. Then, because there are also fields of health science 
that involve bioethics, safety, and other such delicate 
problems, the Health Science Conferences were set up in November 
1986 as round-table discussions with the Minister of Health and 
Welfare. At the conferences, the expert opinions of 
knowledgeable and experienced people are solicited, and it is 
appropriate to aim for a public-consensus type of format. 
  Since the first meeting in November 1986, discussions have 
been held at the Health Science Conferences on issues such as 
the basic mid- and long-term strategies for promoting health 
science, priority research topics that will continue into the 
future, how health science research should be evaluated, and so 
forth. In September 1988 a report entitled "For the 
Establishment of a Basis and Breakthroughs in Health Science 
Research" was compiled. 
  As the mid- and long-term strategies for strengthening the 
system of health science research, this report cites the 
following as necessary in order to establish a foundation: 1) 
revamping the research system; 2) increasing the budget for 
research expenses and making effective use of the strength of 
the private sector; 3) cultivating, securing, and employing 
excellent researchers; and 4) strengthening the research support 
system. For breakthroughs, the report stresses the importance 
of: 1) setting priority themes and implementing research based 
on project formats; 2) facilitating research exchange among 
industry, government, and universities; and 3) facilitating 
research exchange with overseas organizations. 
  The priority research fields at the time were: 


    -  cancer 
  -  aging, geriatric diseases (cardiovascular 
disorders, metabolic disorders) 
  -  mental and neurological 
disorders (including Alzheimer's disease and other such dementia 
diseases) 
  -  infectious diseases (AIDS, hepatitis, ATL, etc.) 
  -  maternity, childhood diseases (perinatal diseases, etc.) 
  -  organ 
technology (artificial organ transplants) 
  -  genetic treatment 
(including human gene sequence research) 
  -  drug-making technology 
(drug design, drug delivery systems, etc.) 
  -  safety evaluation 
science (regulatory science, risk management, etc.) 
  -  lifestyle 
support technology (rehabilitation science, welfare, lifestyle 
machinery, etc.) 
  -  health care technology evaluation methods 
(scientific research and evaluation of effectiveness, safety, 
efficiency, etc., of medical technology, etc.) 

    Periodic revisions, generally about every five years, are 
seen as necessary. In addition, in August 1989 the report 
entitled "How Research Evaluations Should Basically Be," and in 
October 1991, "The Promotion of Human Genome Research in the 
Ministry of Health and Welfare" were compiled. Then, in July 
1992 "The Promotion of Nursing Equipment R&amp;D" and in April 
1993 
"Guidelines on Genetic Treatment Clinical Research" were 
compiled. 
<H5>  C. Promotion of Test Research </H5>
  While dealing with the trends in S&amp;T development 
described 
above, the MHW endeavors to promote test research, centering on 
priority research fields, by mustering the technology of its 
affiliated research institutes, universities, regional hygiene 
institutes, private-sector test research institutes, etc. 
  The MHW's S&amp;T budget is given in Table 1. Due to the 
situation today where the fields that the MHW handles are 
increasingly important, there has been a succession of new 
research projects in recent years. Projects are arranged in 
units of disease, i.e., cancer, cardiovascular disorders, mental 
and neurological disorders, diabetes, kidney failure, 
rheumatism, dementia, non-A-or-B-type hepatitis, and AIDS. 
Across-the-board projects are also emerging that are the kind of 
basic human science research aimed at gerontology research and 
joint government-private research for coping with an aged 
society. 
  In the FY93 budget, there are additional new appropriations 
of &yen;150 million for advanced medical research to implement 
studies geared toward the practical application of genetic 
treatment; &yen;50 million for general research on nursing 
measures; and, from the viewpoint of new global environmental 
and health problems, the research outlays for promoting more 
advanced water service and waste treatment technology were 
rearranged and &yen;360 million are appropriated for promoting 
global and health research projects aimed at the long-term 
maintenance of humankind's health in correspondence with 
environmental changes. In addition, as a major part of the "Stop 
AIDS" strategy, &yen;1.731 billion are appropriated in the FY93 
budget (an increase of &yen;502 million, or 41&percnt; over the 
previous year) for research on AIDS countermeasures, which 
involves research on the prevention of AIDS outbreaks, methods 
of treating AIDS, the development of AIDS drugs, etc.

<H5>  1. Health Science Research Expenses </H5>
  The objectives of health science research are to find 
solutions to the problems of maintaining and promoting the 
people's health and improving health care; to make those results 
reflect in policies; and to contribute to the promotion, 
development of health and welfare administration. Summaries of 
the main research expenses are given below. 
  (1) Expenses for General Research in Longevity Science 
  Longevity science is general science that studies overall 
societies and economies that can happily and robustly maintain 
long life. It is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary field of 
research on elderly people and an aged society. It involves 
elucidating the physiological mechanisms of aging and 
preventing, diagnosing, treating, and elucidating the causes of 
diseases specific to elderly people. This field also encompasses 
research on the social and psychological problems of elderly 
people. 
  Now, as society grows older, the development of technology 
and systems for elderly people to live healthy lives and for 
them to continue to adapt to an independent social lifestyle is 
becoming essential. Then, in order to mobilize related sciences 
to ensure the mental and physical health of elderly people and 
improve the quality of their lives, research in what was dubbed 
"Silver Science" started in FY87 for the purpose of promoting 
the R&amp;D of S&amp;T for coping with an aged society. The name 
of that 
research was changed to general longevity science in FY90, and 
the MHW aims to make it more replete. 
  In the FY92 budget &yen;1.785 billion are appropriated for 
this research, which is an increase of &yen;131 million 
(7.9&percnt;) 
over that of the FY92 budget. 
  (2) Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy 
  In 1981 cancer replaced strokes as the leading cause of 
death 
in Japan, and, with the increase in cancer since then, 
controlling cancer is the earnest wish of the people. 
  Given such a situation, the government cited cancer control 
as one of the most serious issues in government administration. 
The "Cabinet Meeting on Cancer Countermeasures" under the 
leadership of the Prime Minister, and under that the "Meeting of 
Experts on Cancer Countermeasures" made up of 10 experts, were 
set up. Then on 7 June 1983 the "Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy" 
was devised. 
  The aim of the "Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy" is to 
elucidate the true nature of cancer within 10 years. The program 
promotes advanced cancer research, such as research on 
oncogenes, by mobilizing intelligence from within and outside; 
it is an attempt to make those results reflect on the 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer, and should be of 
use to people suffering from cancer. To that end, various 
efforts will be made as basic policies for achieving the 
following five goals: 
  1) setting priority research topics, 
  2) promoting concentrated, diversified research, 
  3) finding ways to nurture and employ young researchers, 
  4) promoting international cooperation centering on Japan 
and 
the U.S., and 
  5) maintaining support systems such as systems for supplying 
experimental materials. 
  That which forms the core of the strategy is the promotion 
of 
priority, intensive, diversified research aimed at elucidating 
the essence of cancer. 
  The research fields that will be tackled along the lines of 
the Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy are the following six fields: 
  1) research on human cancer genes, 
  2) research on human carcinogenesis due to viruses,, 
  3) research on carcinogenic acceleration and suppression of 
that, 
  4) research in connection with the development of new 
technology for the early diagnosis of cancer, 
  5) research in connection with the development of treatment 
methods based on new theories, and 
  6) research on mechanisms of immunological suppression and 
control substances. 
  Project teams are formed for each of the research fields 
promoted. 
  These strategic efforts are being tackled by the government, 
universities, and the private sector. Within the government, the 
MHW, MOE, and STA collaborate in research on cancer. &yen;1.847 
billion are appropriated in the MHW's FY93 budget. 
  This fiscal year is the last year of the Ten-Year 
Anti-Cancer 
Strategy. Now, the MOE is taking a hard look at the results of 
the research thus far and the future prospects, and studies are 
being made on the Post-Ten-Year Anti-Cancer Strategy. 
  (3) Basic Human Science Research 
  Research at the MHW had been carried out within a vertical 
system in the form of measures against individual diseases such 
as cancer, cardiovascular disorders, incurable diseases, etc. 
But, amidst the remarkable developments in S&amp;T, there is a 
need 
for the development of basic technologies in the broad areas of 
health care, medicine, and welfare. To that end, the MHW is to 
facilitate joint government-private research in basic science 
while continuing to actively make the best use of private-sector 
energy. Since FY88 it has been promoting that research under the 
name Basic Human Science Research, which had been called 
Longevity-Related Basic Scientific Research since FY86. 
  The contents of that research are: 1) biotechnology 
applications and the development of evaluation technology, which 
form the basis of the life sciences; 2) the establishment of 
sugar-chain engineering as a new technology and the application 
of that in the fields of medicine and medical treatment; 3) 
research on technology for evaluating, improving, and developing 
the medical materials that form the basis for medical and 
welfare services; 4) elucidating the biodefense mechanisms that 
form the basis of health maintenance. 
  (4) Expenses for New Medical Technology R&amp;D 
  These consist of three research outlays: New Medical 
Technology Developmental Research Expenses, Organ Technology 
Clinical R&amp;D Expenses, and Emergency and Disaster Medical 
Treatment General Scientific Research Expenses. The New Medical 
Technology Developmental Research Expenses promoted the "New 
Medical Technology Research Expenses" that was instituted in 
FY64 in the form of joint industry-government-university project 
research since FY90. In FY93, research on the development of 
more efficient medical equipment was added, and &yen;226 million 
was appropriated. 
  The Organ Technology Clinical R&amp;D Expenses, which were 
instituted in FY90, promote clinical research for establishing 
organ transplant technology and for safely and effectively 
carrying out organ transplants. This fiscal year, research on a 
network system for organ transplants within Japan, research in 
connection with the dissemination of information about organ 
transplants, and research on organ transplant coordinator 
technology were added. &yen;100 million were appropriated for 
these expenses. Emergency and Disaster Medical Treatment General 
Scientific Research Expenses were instituted in FY91 for 
studying medical treatment in natural disasters and in urban 
group disasters. In FY93 &yen;100 million are appropriated.

research on the treatment of specific diseases and specific 
chronic childhood diseases. The objectives of these efforts are 
to investigate incurable diseases whose causes are unclear and 
for which treatment methods are not established, and to 
establish treatment methods for those. In the FY93 budget, 
&yen;23.052 billion are appropriated, which is an increase of 
&yen;1.685 billion (7.8&percnt;) over that of FY92. 
<H5>  3. Other Important Research Expenses </H5>
  The cancer research subsidies are expenses for promoting 
cancer research. The outlays for commissioning research on 
cardiovascular diseases are for conducting research on the 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cerebral apoplexy and 
heart disease. The outlays for commissioning research on mental 
and neurological disorders are for conducting research on mental 
retardation resulting from mental and neurological handicaps, 
for research on muscular dystrophy due to muscular developmental 
disorders, etc. The expenses for commissioning research in 
pediatric medicine are for diagnosing, treating, and conducting 
research studies on childhood diseases that are difficult to 
cure. The expenses for commissioning international joint 
research are for conducting research in connection with disease 
conditions in and assistance measures for developing countries. 
<H5>  4. Test Research Organization Expenses </H5>
  The test research organizations affiliated with the MHW
