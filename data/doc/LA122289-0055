METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : MANAGER SAYS MURPHY DISLIKED BUCHWALD 
STORY 
Eddie Murphy's manager testified Thursday the comedian never liked a story sold 
to Paramount Pictures by humorist Art Buchwald, who is suing the studio for 
allegedly stealing his idea to make Murphy's "Coming to America" hit. 
Robert Wachs, testifying at the Superior Court trial of Buchwald's $5-million 
breach-of-contract lawsuit, also said he shared Murphy's opinion of Buchwald's 
story, entitled "King for a Day." Wachs testified: "We never liked it from the 
beginning. I told Paramount innumerable times that we didn't like it. It became 
a joke." 
Buchwald's lawsuit claims "Coming to America" was based on "King for a Day," a 
story concept he sold to the studio in 1983. "Coming to America" is about an 
African prince who comes to New York to find a bride. Buchwald's concept 
focused on a king from an oil-rich African nation who is stranded in Washington 
when he is overthrown.
