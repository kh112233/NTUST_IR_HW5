FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Elections planned for new Welsh unitary
authorities - Other measures
THE GOVERNMENT is pressing ahead with plans to reform the structure of local
government in Wales by holding shadow elections to new unitary authorities
as early as next year, Roland Adburgham writes. It intends that these
councils should take over in April 1995.
The bill is expected to follow closely proposals in a Welsh Office white
paper. This described plans to replace the existing eight county councils
and 37 district councils with 21 unitary authorities. The white paper
followed more than 18 months of consultation which found support for the
principle of unitary authorities, although the counties and the Labour party
argue there should be no reorganisation without first creating an elected
Welsh assembly. The government rejects this.
Mr Russell Goodway, chairman of the Assembly of Welsh Counties, said that
without a Welsh assembly the current system should remain. 'A very expensive
reorganisation will not result in a better system and improved services,' he
said.
The district councils, however, are broadly in favour. Mr Tom Williams,
chairman of the Council of Welsh Districts, said: 'A new structure of at
least 21 unitary authorities will lead to a renewal of local democracy at
considerably less cost than at present. Such a structure will save at least
Pounds 100m over the next 10 years.'
About 150,000 people work for Welsh councils and the biggest part of the
transitional costs will be redundancy payments.
