STOLEN MONET, 8 OTHER WORKS ARE RECOVERED 
Clues from Japan led police to a stolen masterpiece by Claude Monet that gave 
its name to Impressionism, a French police chief said today. 
Monet's "Impression Sunrise" and eight other Impressionist works were taken 
from a Paris museum five years ago. 
All nine were recovered from a villa on the French island of Corsica on 
Wednesday. 
Mireille Ballestrazzi, head of France's art theft police squad, said more than 
12 suspects were being held. One was handed over to a judge, who will decide 
whether to press charges. 
It was not clear whether those arrested included the hooded bandits who raided 
the Marmottan Museum in broad daylight. 
Ballestrazzi said she found the first clues three years ago during an 
investigation in Japan, where experts feared the works could have been sold. 
"We got some testimonies that led us to Corsica step by step," she said in a 
television interview. 
Apart from Monet's 1872 masterpiece -- a misty dawn in Normandy that gave its 
name to the Impressionist movement -- the nine recovered paintings included two 
by Auguste Renoir. 
Two were slightly damaged.
