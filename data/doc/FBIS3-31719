Steal Data on the Tamara Radar"] 
  [Text] Prague--The HTT Group company, the manufacturer of 
the Tamara passive radar, has registered an unsuccessful attempt 
at industrial espionage, Ludek Stodulka, vice president of the 
company, told MLADA FRONTA DNES. Tamara is a state-of-the-art 
air defense system, which, according to experts, can uncover 
even the "invisible" U.S. Stealth bomber. 
  The attempt to obtain secret information on the production 
of 
Tamara was supposedly made by a certain Czech arms company. 
Stodulka did not specify which company it was, nor did he reveal 
any details about the espionage attempt. He did indicate, 
however, that the arms company wanted to gain access to 
information about Tamara by offering jobs to three key HTT Group 
employees. 
  Ludek Stodulka also said that this unnamed company, in 
cooperation with foreign competitors, rendered it impossible for 
the HTT Group company to export Tamara, which can fetch up to 
$17 million, to one Persian Gulf country. The competitors 
supposedly thwarted the long-planned deal, which was to have 
been the first export of Tamara since 1992, by spreading false 
information about the radar's abilities.
