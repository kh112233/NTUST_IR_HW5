REX, NON-SEXIST POLICE DOG, SNIFFS OUT HIS MAN 
Santa Ana police dog Rex got his man Thursday. Or was it a woman? 
The incident began about 9 a.m. when a patrolman spotted a suspect from a Feb. 
1 robbery driving outside a check-cashing store. The suspect slowly pulled over 
and stopped. Suddenly, he jumped from the car and ran, disappearing in the back 
yards of homes along the 2300 block of South Olive Street. 
Maureen Thomas, a Santa Ana Police Department spokesperson, said the suspect 
ran to his home at 2306 S. Olive St. 
Officers called for police dogs, but the suspect slipped out the back of his 
house and made his way through yards until he reached 2302 S. Olive. There he 
broke a window and went in, where he was spotted by officers and their dogs. 
Shortly afterwards, police spotted a person dressed in a blouse, skirt and 
panty hose leave through the back door. 
Officers might had been fooled for a second, but not Rex, who cornered the 
suspect in a nearby back yard. 
Police arrested Jaime R. Perez, 18. He was treated at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange for bites on both arms. 
Police booked Perez on suspicion of strong-arm robbery in the Feb. 1 incident. 
Officers alleged Perez approached a woman outside the ABC Check Cashing store 
on South Grand Avenue in Santa Ana, shoved her against a car and took $1,500 
from her. He also was booked on suspicion of resisting arrest Thursday. 
Rex, who has been on the police force for 2 years, suffered a paw injury, but 
Thomas said he was doing fine. GEORGE FRANK
