FT  28 JAN 93 / Textile group in Ulster investment
A LEADING Far Eastern textile group announced yesterday it was investing
Pounds 95m in a project in Northern Ireland, with the aim of boosting its
presence in Europe.
Texmaco-Polysindo, the Indonesian manufacturer of polyester filament yarn
and garments, is locating production facilities at a site in Antrim formerly
owned by Akzo, the Dutch chemical company. It hopes to create 900 jobs over
the next three years.
The Antrim site, near Belfast airport, is to have two factories. The first
company, Norfol, will make yarn from polyester chips, and has an annual
production target of 20,000 tonnes expected to be reached by the end of next
year.
The second, Pan European Textiles, will focus on weaving and processing
fabrics from the yarn with a production target of 5,000 tonnes within the
next two years.
The UK government, through the Northern Ireland Industrial Development
Board, is to contribute Pounds 14.6m in the form of training and capital
equipment grants and in facilitating a low interest loan.
Industry analysts say Texmaco has been seeking a European site in
anticipation of the EC raising tariffs and introducing anti-dumping measures
against the third world.
It chose Northern Ireland after looking at potential sites on the UK
mainland (Leeds and Bradford), Spain, and France.
Northern Ireland officials yesterday heralded Texmaco's announcement as a
boost to confidence following a year in which the government's record for
attracting overseas investment has been criticised.
Dr Graham Gudgin, head of the Northern Ireland Research Centre (NIERC) said
last night, however, that on past experience of overseas investment it was
possible 'not all the promised 900 jobs will be created'.
A report at the end of last year by the Northern Ireland Economic Council
said employment in externally-owned plants in the region fell by 46,000
between 1973 and 1990.
