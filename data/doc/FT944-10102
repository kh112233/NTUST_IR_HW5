FT  12 NOV 94 / Tighter ferry rules proposed
European Union transport ministers are to ask the Commission to draw up
tighter inspection procedures for roll-on roll-off passenger ferries
operating from European ports. Ferry operators would also be required to
count and record information about the identity of passengers.
The action follows the sinking of the Estonia in the Baltic in September
with the loss of more than 900 lives. The commission will be asked to ensure
that the International Maritime Organisation's safety rules and codes for
ferry working procedures are enforced. EU ministers will call for an
investigation of the need for 'black box' recorders as used on aircraft and
for the port authorities to be given powers to prevent ferries leaving port
in bad weather.
