FT  09 JAN 92 / School funding for inner cities
A Pounds 20m three-year scheme to raise educational standards in inner-city
schools was announced by the government yesterday.
Nearly Pounds 10m will go on projects to improve reading skills, in which
weaknesses were identified in last year's tests for seven-year-olds.
