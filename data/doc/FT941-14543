FT  20 JAN 94 / Successful peace initiative 'would boost Ulster tourism'
A successful peace initiative in Northern Ireland would prompt a 40 per cent
rise in tourist numbers to 1.77m a year within three to five years and
create 'many thousands of new jobs', Mr Hugh O'Neil, chairman of the
Northern Ireland Tourist Board, said yesterday.
He said tourist numbers to Northern Ireland rose last year for the fifth
consecutive year. Final figures for have still to be compiled, but tourist
inquiries and hotel occupancy rates showed increases over 1992 for the first
half, with inquiries up 70 per cent.
Last year the NITB launched a marketing campaign which, for the first time,
used television advertising in the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and
northern England. The NITN has also expandedoffice representation in Europe,
North America and Australasia.
Investment in the tourist industry in the province is estimated at Pounds
200m over the past five years. Mr O'Neil said: 'While much of this
development has been provided by the public sector we expect it to be a
stimulus to investment from the private sector in 1994, particularly in new
accommodation.'
In 1992, the last year for which complete figures are available, there were
1.25m visitors to Northern Ireland. One in five of these were purely for
holiday purposes, 500,000 were visiting friends or relatives, while 500,000
were on business or for 'other purposes'.
Larne, the main commercial and passenger port between the UK and Northern
Ireland, reported a record of 1.8m passengers last year, an increase of 10.4
per cent. Car and caravan numbers rose 12.7 per cent to 414,000, while
commercial vehicles rose to 364,000 and cargo handled reached 4.3m net
tonnes, all breaking previous records.
The government is to spend Pounds 2.5m refurbishing Northern Ireland's
parliament building at Stormont in Belfast. The building, opened in 1932,
needs work including new water and electrical services. The parliament was
dissolved in 1972 when London introduced direct rule.
