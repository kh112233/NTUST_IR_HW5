 

VII. Environmental Impact 



Calgene's initial submission requesting an advisory opinion regarding whether the 

kan



r

 gene may be used in the production of genetically engineered tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape plants included an environmental
assessment (EA). The agency received comments on this EA. As noted earlier, the request for advisory opinion was later
converted to a food additive petition at Calgene's request at which time Calgene submitted an updated EA. At the time
the notice of filing was published in the 

Federal Register

, FDA announced that the petitioner's EA was being made available to the public at the Dockets Management Branch (address
above) and expressly solicited comments on the EA. No additional comments were received in response to this request
for comments. The comments received on the original EA are discussed below. 
One comment asserted that the 

kan



r

 gene could spread from tomato, cotton, and oilseed rape plants to other crops and related weeds by pollen flow when
the 

kan



r

 gene-containing crops are grown near nontransgenic crops, and in locations where the 

kan



r

-gene containing crops have wild relatives. The comment noted that transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene would create a problem if it were to make wild and weedy relatives more difficult to control. 
The comment also criticized the Calgene submission for not addressing whether it is ``wise to contribute foreign
genes to the gene pools of wild plants even where the plants do not become weeds or manifest other obviously harmful
traits'' and stated that Calgene's submission ``too easily dismissed the problem of 
outcrossing from the engineered oilseed rape.'' The comment noted that oilseed rape has wild and weedy relatives
with which it can breed, and that ``it is not sufficient to rely on traditional commercial control practices to control
gene flow,'' but that the rate of gene flow must be experimentally determined and then ``controlled by procedures
that are demonstrated, not assumed, to work.'' 
The agency has considered the potential for adverse environmental effects from the commercial use of cotton, tomato,
and oilseed rape plants modified to contain the 

kan



r

 gene. The agency notes that it is possible for cotton and tomato plants to transfer the 

kan



r

 gene to neighboring plants of the same species via cross-pollination, although commercially grown cotton and tomatoes
are primarily self-pollinating. Oilseed rape plants are also capable of pollinating sexually compatible wild relatives,
although not all crosses with wild relatives prove fertile. Importantly, however, introduction of the 

kan



r

 gene will not confer a competitive advantage upon a plant receiving it. That is, the gene will not enhance the plant's
capacity to compete with other plants for available resources. In particular, there will be no selective pressure
on plants containing the 

kan



r

 gene because kanamycin will not be present in the environment in sufficient concentrations to create such pressure.
First, there are no specific therapeutic uses of kanamycin that would result in its widespread application to agricultural
crops. Also, kanamycin does not accumulate in the environment from production by soil microbes or by land application
of animal wastes (Ref. 36). Accordingly, FDA has concluded that transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene to other crops or related weeds will have no significant adverse environmental effects. 
With regard to the comment about outcrossing from engineered oilseed rape, the comment provided no information to
show that the transfer of the 

kan



r

 gene to wild or weedy relatives of oilseed rape will be any more frequent or have any greater significance than the transfer
of other genes from cultivated oilseed rape. FDA is aware of no human health or environmental concern associated with
such transfer. Therefore, the agency does not agree that the cultivation of 

kan



r

-containing oilseed rape should be subject to control practices any different from those used traditionally. 
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action, including those described
in the comments discussed in this document. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on
the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant
impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets
Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
