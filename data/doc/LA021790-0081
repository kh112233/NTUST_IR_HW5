SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
An Escondido couple indicted last May on charges of illegally smuggling exotic 
birds into the United States have pleaded guilty. 
On Thursday, Michael Daye, 40, who owns a pet store in Long Beach, pleaded 
guilty to conspiracy to import protected wildlife, which carries a maximum 
five-year term in federal prison and a $250,000 fine. 
On Friday, his wife, Jane Daye, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of 
aiding and abetting transportation and receipt of protected wildlife. 
U.S. District Court Judge J. Lawrence Irving set sentencing for Michael Daye 
for Aug. 6. He remains free on a $250,000 personal surety bond. 
At the request of Jane Daye's attorney, Cindy Aaron, she was sentenced 
immediately to one year of probation with no jail time or fine. 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Cynthia Millsaps said Jane Daye was a minor figure in the 
scheme, which included 10 other people, according to the grand jury indictment 
handed down May 31. Only three defendants in the case have not pleaded guilty, 
and their trial is set for April 17. 
The exotic birds came from Southeast Asia, Central and South America and 
Mexico. They included various types of cockatoos, parrots and macaws. 
Some of the species are so threatened with extinction that an international 
treaty has been signed by 97 nations that prohibits all trade with these birds, 
according to information supplied by the U.S. attorney's office. Some of the 
birds smuggled were valued at $8,000 to $10,000 each.
