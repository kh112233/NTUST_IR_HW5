SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



On August 22, 1991, the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition from the National Audubon Society,
The Humane Society of the United States, Defenders of Wildlife, Greater Ecosystem Alliance, Friends of the Loomis
Forest, Methrow Valley Forest Watch, Save Chelan Alliance, Lower Columbia Basin Audubon Society, Tonasker Forest
Watch, Pilchuck Audubon Society, North Cascades Audubon Society, and Sierra Club Cascade Chapter to list the North
American lynx of the North Cascades ecosystem of Washington as an endangered species under the emergency provisions
of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq

.), and to designate critical habitat. The Service made a 90-day finding on February 4, 1992, that substantial information
had not been presented to indicate that listing the lynx in the North Cascades may be warranted. Notice of the finding
was published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 6, 1992 (57 FR 46007).

On August 10, 1992, the petitioners filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington
in Seattle challenging the not substantial finding made by the Service. The Service agreed to reevaluate its 90-day
finding. On July 1, 1993, the Service found pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(b)(3)(A), that
substantial scientific or commercial evidence was not available to indicate that the lynx population in the North
Cascades should be listed as endangered. The notice of that finding was published July 9, 1993 (58 FR 36924). The July
finding supersedes the February finding. The July notice expressed the Service's belief that a rangewide status
review should be conducted. Because of that statement, petitioners and the Service were able to come to an agreement
to settle the pending lawsuit based on a commitment to complete the review by November 15, 1994.

The Service has been soliciting information on the status of the lynx since the species first appeared on the September
18, 1985, Animal Notice of Review as a category 2 candidate species. The Service acknowledges that evidence exists
indicating that an in-depth rangewide status review for the lynx, a category 2 candidate species, should be continued.
The Service solicits any information, data, comments, and suggestions from the public, other concerned government
agencies, the scientific community, industry, or other interested parties concerning the biological status of
this species. The Service will complete the status review and publish its finding no later than November 15, 1994.
