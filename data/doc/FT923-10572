FT  30 JUL 92 / S African security forces warned on detainees' treatment
THE African National Congress (ANC) yesterday warned that South African
security force members who assault people in their custody face prosecution
under 'a future democratic government'.
The warning follows a pathologist's accusation at the weekend that police
had killed scores of detainees in recent years. Since the claim, a further
two men in police custody have died, one in a police station.
The police came in for further criticism this week when the Goldstone
commission of inquiry into political violence said the force had failed
effectively to prosecute perpetrators of violence on black commuter trains.
The commission said it had been unable to say who had been responsible for
the killings, adding that 'victims were members of various black ethnic
groups'.
The police, meanwhile, launched a 'peace offensive' yesterday to restore
their authority in black townships around Johannesburg.
Mr Hernus Kriel, the law and order minister, said 5,000 police and troops
would take part in the 'stabilisation' operation in 16 townships, some of
which are sliding into anarchy. Between July 1991 and April this year, 138
people have been killed and 261 injured.
