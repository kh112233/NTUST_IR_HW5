To Develop Biological Weapons"] 
  [Text] Prague--The dangerous organisms that Czechoslovak 
scientists were studying in military establishments in the 
1970's and 1980's included, for example, the Muray Valley 
encephalitis virus, which originates in Australia; a virus 
called St. Louis encephalitis; bacteria of the Japanese B 
encephalitis, strain "schun" [word as published]; and the virus 
of the "murman" seal species. These microorganisms cause mainly 
inflammations of the meninges; they have a very severe clinical 
progression and a lethal conclusion. The former Soviet Union 
asked the former government for an analysis of the above 
microorganisms. 
  Czech scientists supposedly never worked with the most 
dangerous infections such as smallpox, pestilence, and anthrax. 
  According to Ales Macela, dean of scientific activity at the 
Jan Evangelista Purkyne Military Medical Academy in Hradec 
Kralove, conditions have never been established in the Czech 
Republic for the handling of genetic material of microorganisms 
or for the production of a larger quantity of microbes, which 
would have been necessary for the development and production of 
a biological weapon.
