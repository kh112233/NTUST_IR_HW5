"Foreign Investments in Estonia"] 
  [Text] 
  How much foreign capital has been invested in Estonia 
over any given period of time is a question that elicits 
different replies from different agencies, or different sources 
of information. 
  Figures published in the media on the volume of foreign 
investments made in Estonia over a certain period of time often 
show only a part of the actual investments--namely, amounts 
making up the equity of joint ventures being formed over a 
certain period. This information is gathered by the business 
register of ESA [Estonian Bureau of Statistics], where all the 
new ventures are registered, including both joint ventures and 
those financed by foreign capital exclusively. This data makes 
it possible to obtain an overview of new ventures being formed 
in Estonia over a given time period, including the extent of 
foreign capital in their equity. What presents a problem here is 
that many of the ventures are formed either to be resold (the 
so-called shelf-enterprises), for one transaction only, or for 
other such reasons, that would necessitate corrections to be 
made in the amounts obtained from the business register. 
According to data received from the receivables department at 
the Bank of Estonia, foreign capital invested as equity in new 
ventures over the past year only accounted for about 38 percent 
of the total of foreign investments made in Estonia. 
<H5>  What Are Foreign and Direct Investments? </H5>
  According to international methodology, foreign investments 
consist of direct and portfolio investments. A direct investment 
is an investment that guarantees voting rights in the management 
of the venture (enterprise, bank or fund), which enables the 
investor to influence the performance of the venture. Since 
these criteria could vary in the case of different ventures, a 
direct investment, according to international convention, is one 
that amounts to at least 10 percent of the assets or equity for 
a given venture. Hence, direct investment is a form of foreign 
investment where a resident of one country (direct investor) 
owns 10 percent or more of the assets or equity of an enterprise 
domiciled in a different country. 
  A direct investment involves: 
  1) an initial transaction between partners resulting in a 
direct investment relationship between them; 
  2) subsequent transactions between their enterprises or 
their 
affiliates. 
  Making up the other form of foreign investments are the 
portfolio investments representing ownership of less than 10 
percent of the assets or equity by a non-resident. 
  Since portfolio investments are still negligible in Estonia 
for the time being, we can apply the term 'foreign investments' 
when speakig of foreign direct investments. 
<H5>  Components of Direct Investments </H5>
  Direct investments, shown under liabilities on the balance 
sheet currently being prepared by the Bank of Estonia, consist 
of the following: 
  1) Increasing assets or equity; 
  - in joint ventures being created during a certain period 
due 
to foreign investments (new investments); 
  - in joint ventures already operational due to an influx of 
foreign capital (supplementary investments); 
  2) Reinvested income, consisting of the foreign investor's 
portion of undistributed profits of the joint venture, and which 
are left at the disposal of the enterprise operating in Estonia, 
enabling the development of the latter; 
  3) long-term loans [.sup]1[/] obtained from foreign 
investors, after the deduction of payments; 
  4) short-term loans obtained from foreign investments, after 
the deduction of payments; 
<H5>  Sources of Data </H5>
  The Bank of Estonia gets its data on new investments for the 
period being viewed from the business register of ESA's main 
computing center. The difference between data obtained from the 
business register and data used in calculating the liability 
total for the state can be attributed to the assumption that at 
least 20 percent of businesses registered during a certain 
period have not yet received their foreign funding, and that 
some of the joint ventures are fictitious (created primarily to 
be resold), only 80 percent of the total investment figure 
obtained from the business register of ESA's main computing 
center gets applied to the liability balance of the state. 
  Data on other components of direct investments are obtained 
by means of a direct survey of businesses conducted quarterly by 
the receivables department of Bank of Estonia. 
<H5>  Volume of Foreign Investments </H5>
  During the first nine months of 1993, foreign investors 
placed roughly 1.5 billion kroons in businesses based in Estonia. 
  Initial funding for new ventures amounted to 561.1 million 
kroons. This amount also includes proceeds from the sale of 
state enterprises to non-residents. Since the privatization 
process is only beginning, foreign funds from the sale of state 
enterprises have not been significant. Assets of joint ventures 
already operational have increased by 246.4 million kroons over 
the nine months of last year, due to the influx of foreign 
capital. In the third quarter, the influx of foreign capital 
into joint ventures already operational exceeded, for the first 
time, the foreign investment total in new ventures. If the 
influx of funding into joint ventures already operational 
accounted for 16.2 percent of all the foreign capital coming to 
Estonia during the first quarter, and 7.8 percent during the 
second quarter then, by the third quarter, it had risen to 51.7 
percent. It seems that the more vigorous of the joint ventures 
are beginning to gain momentum, and the creation of new ventures 
will start tapering off gradually. 
  The dynamics of the next important component of direct 
investments--reinvested proceeds--showed steady growth, which 
signifies increased productivity in the performance of joint 
ventures. During the nine months of 1993, reinvested proceeds 
amounted to 262.7 million kroons. The difference between the 
pay-out and pay-back amounts of long-term loans extended by 
direct investors amounted to 104.3 million kroons, and the 
difference between the pay-out and pay-back amounts of 
short-term loans extended by direct investors amounted to 281.4 
million kroons. 
  Current projections show that foreign investments made in 
Estonia during 1993 total slightly over 2 billion kroons. More 
accurate data will be available by mid-February. 
<H5>  Estonia's Basic Business Partners </H5>
  Last year, the greatest number of joint ventures was formed 
with Finnish companies (1,212 for nine months, which includes 
502 for the third quarter). Once again, it should be pointed out 
that many of those businesses are not operational, and may never 
become operational. Finland was followed by Sweden with 246, 
Russia with 203, Germany with 88, United States with 31 
companies, etc. 
  Analyzing the volume of initial funding in new ventures by 
different states showed that Sweden placed first, followed by 
Finland, United States, Russia and others. 
  Even though Finland, Sweden, Russia and Germany are our 
basic 
business partners for both the number of new ventures and the 
volume of initial capital invested in them, these states are not 
among the first 10 for the average volume of funds invested in 
one business. Based on that indicator Finland, for example, was 
number 22 among the 41 countries whose companies invested in 
Estonian businesses. Thus, many relatively small joint ventures 
are formed with these countries, as our closest neighbors. 
  A state-by-state analysis of foreign partners contributing 
to 
the influx of foreign capital in joint ventures already 
operational shows steady gains for ventures that are in 
partnership with Swedish companies. In second place for their 
volume of additional funding in joint ventures already 
operational in Estonia are Finnish companies, followed by 
Italian and Irish companies. 
  Estonian companies are maintaining intensive investor 
relationships (basically for loans and commercial credit) with 
business partners from Netherlands, Switzerland, Great Britain 
and Denmark. 
  For the productivity of their performance (based on the 
volume of reinvested proceeds) one could point to joint ventures 
formed with Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands. 
<H5>  Areas Attracting Foreign Investors </H5>
  The biggest portion of foreign investments (roughly 45 
percent) goes into industry, followed by wholesale and retail 
trade, leasing of property and business services. Also worth 
mentioning are direct investments in hotels and restaurants, 
also in transportation, warehousing and communications. 
  Looking at the dividend and interest payments to direct 
investors, one can conclude that a relatively large number of 
joint ventures either do not have to pay dividends during a 
certain period (depending on the charter agreement), do not turn 
a profit yet, or are not out for immediate profit (in the form 
of dividends), but are there to develop the market or for some 
other such reason.

  [Text] In conclusion, it should be pointed out that even 
though most 
of the joint ventures being surveyed submit their data on time, 
in accordance with questionnaires sent to them by the Bank of 
Estonia, there are still many shortcomings. Receiving more 
complete data is vital to the analysis of our country's economic 
situation, which is the cornerstone of the economic policies to 
be developed. As feedback, the latter inevitably impacts the 
operating conditions of all businesses. This is why we want to 
take this opportunity to ask, once again, that all businesses 
who receive survey forms from Bank of Estonia's department of 
receivables for the purpose of calculating the liabilities 
total, fill them out properly and return them promptly.
