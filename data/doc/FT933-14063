FT  16 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Far Eastern power ventures agreed
POWER generating equipment suppliers Toshiba and Westinghouse Electric have
announced agreements to reinforce positions in the Asian market.
Westinghouse is forming a joint venture in China to modernise steam turbine
generators. Toshiba has reached a technology transfer agreement with Samsung
Heavy Industries of South Korea.
Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse said its 50/50 joint venture with Longyuan
Power Technology Exploitation Corporation would initially focus on 150 steam
turbine-generators, each rated at 200MW.
Ultimately, a base will be established to provide technology and advanced
field service for more than 400 power stations in China.
Toshiba's 10-year deal with Samsung covers supercritical 500MW-class steam
power plants. It calls for the Japanese company to transfer design,
manufacturing and inspection technologies for the condensers, feedwater
heaters and de-aerators that make up the heat exchangers.
The deal is expected to reinforce Samsung's position in Korea for heavy
electrical apparatus, while enhancing Toshiba's strength in a key area of
power generation.
