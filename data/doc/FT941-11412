FT  04 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Trouble-free shirt all sewn up
Japanese technology is on the way to developing what must be the world's
most trouble-free shirt, writes William Dawkins.
Sanyo Shokai, a clothing company, and Bridgestone, the tyre producer, have
developed an all but indestructible method of fixing buttons to clothes.
The technique, due in shops for the autumn, comes hot on the heels of the
'memory' shirt that automatically holds its wrinkle-free shape after
washing.
The key to Sanyo Shokai's button treatment is a dab of clear urethane resin
on the threads. The flexible resin seeps into the fibres and hardens, making
the stitches almost indestructible. The cost is tiny: between Y2 (1p) and Y3
per button.
At first, Sanyo Shokai plans to use the treatment for heavy-duty buttons on
suits and coats. But the logical next step, unpopable buttons on 'memory'
shirts, cannot be far away. Sanyo Shokai: Japan, 03 3357 4111.
