<F P=106> Liquid Absorption Lowers Emissions from </F>
Industrial and Waste Incinerators 
  [TEXT]Duesseldorf. 
How cleanly an industrial or waste incinerator plant operates 
depends first and foremost on the scrubbing of the flue gas. A 
process tested in Switzerland offers an economical and effective 
alternative. 
  Requirements regarding the effectiveness of clean-ups have 
increased a great deal since the eighties, the last significant 
milestone up to now is the 17th Regulation in the Federal 
Emission Protection Law, which since 1990 has drastically 
lowered the permissible levels for heavy metals, dioxins and 
furans in new waste incinerator plants. Because of their size 
and cost, modern facilities for cleaning waste gas are scarcely 
distinguishable from the actual production or incineration units. 
  A process for liquid absorption tested in Switzerland meets 
legal standards for separation efficiency and also promises 
substantial advantages with respect to investment and operating 
costs. The principle is simple: an alkaline washing solution is 
sprayed at high speed into the reaction compartment (absorber) 
and turned by the turbulence into tiny droplets which form a 
high surface area for reactions with the materials contained in 
the flue gas. The mostly acidic components of the flue gas are 
neutralized, the used washing solution is captured. A partial 
stream from this is replaced with calcium hydroxide or calcium 
chloride, the resulting calcium salts are filtered off and 
dried, the regenerated washing solution can then be sprayed back 
into the absorber again. 
  The fundamental difference compared to conventional flue gas 
scrubbing procedures is: the liquid absorption does not work on 
the countercurrent principle, but instead the opposing stream of 
gas and liquid is maintained, the gas scrubbing does however 
occur in an horizontally placed washer. This technique permits a 
connection in series of several absorption stages and thus a 
reduction of the respective concentrations of pollutant in the 
waste gas [at each stage]. 
  "In principle it is suitable for nearly all combustion 
processes," according to the inventor and patent holder Johann 
Renneberg, director of Renneberg Engineering Consulting in 
Neckargmuend. It is, however, especially suited for use with 
waste gases which are heavily contaminated with sulphur and 
chlorine. Test runs in the special waste incineration plant in 
the Swiss [town of] Hausen near Brugg had already yielded 
astonishing conclusions by the end of the seventies. According 
to measurements taken by the Federal Materials Testing and 
Experimental Institute (EMPT) it was possible to separate 
99.9% 
of the sulphur dioxide (SO[.sub]2[/]), 99.9% of the hydrogen 
chloride (HCl) and 99.9% of the hydrogen fluoride (HF). 
The 
results in a incineration plant built in Stuttgart were also 
convincing. According to Renneberg it was possible to reduce the 
HCl concentration from around 30 g per m[.sup]3[/] to 7 to 11 
mg/m[.sup]3[/]. 
  The alkaline components of the washing solution also react 
with the nitrogen oxides (NO[.sub]x[/]), carbon monoxide 
(CO), and even carbon dioxide (CO[.sub]2[/]). NO[.sub]x[/] 
is converted to 92%, CO to 50% and CO[.sub]2[/] to 15%. 

But Renneberg was also concerned about the separation of dioxins 
and furans. According to his thinking, the washing solution 
could be sprayed in together with suspended activated charcoal, 
which picks up dioxins and furans. 
  Since a separate NO[.sub]x[/] reduction step and a 
downstream activated charcoal filter can be dispensed with, 
liquid absorption saves money. According to Renneberg, the 
investment and operating costs can also be kept low through the 
simple construction of the absorber, the small space requirement 
and the recovery of the washing solution. Compared to 
conventional flue gas scrubbing methods, he figures on 
investment costs which are 20% to 30% lower, 
operating costs 
15% to 25% lower. 
  There is, however, a tinge of bitterness: since the 
development of the process at the end of the seventies, none of 
the financially strong installation builders has shown any 
interest in a co-production. At the beginning of the eighties, 
the interest in more effective processes for flue gas scrubbing 
was weak, since at that time the Standards for Technical 
Instructions for Air [Treatment] did not yet exist. And today? 
"The market in Germany is firmly in the hands of a few large 
companies," Renneberg summarizes his experience: "new and 
cost-efficient development has hardly any chance." 
  He is now turning his hopes toward the USA. The Epri 
Institute in San Francisco is now carrying out an 
analysis--commissioned by the government--of current techniques 
for cleaning waste gas. Renneberg will introduce his process 
there. "Then perhaps it will make its way back to Germany again."
