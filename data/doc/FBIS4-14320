  [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, has 
said imposition of arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina is a clear 
violation of Article 51 of the UN Charter. He was addressing a 
news conference, along with other foreign ministers of ICO 
[Islamic Conference Organization] Contact Group on Bosnia at the 
United Nations. He said according to the interpretation of the 
ICO, the Security Council by imposing the embargo had in fact 
amended the UN Charter, which was something beyond its own 
mandate. 
  The foreign minister said the government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina held the special UN representative, Mr. 
Akashi, responsible for the deaths in Gorazde by acting to stop 
the air strikes against the Serb aggressors. He said the ICO 
members support this view and favor the removal of Mr. Akashi 
from his position. He said there are many other countries, 
besides the ICO members, who are also demanding his removal. 
  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said during their meeting with the UN 
secretary general, the ICO foreign ministers raised the question 
that if there was no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, then what 
exactly the UN forces were keeping there. [sentence as heard] 
The peacekeeping forces must have a clear defined role of 
enforcing peace, he added.
