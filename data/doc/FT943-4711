FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: 'Natural' keyboard from
Microsoft
Microsoft, the world's largest publisher of personal computer software, has
launched an ergonomically designed 'natural' PC keyboard to help users avoid
the dangers of repetitive stress injuries.
Microsoft makes no claims that the keyboard will cure or prevent any form of
RSI. Labels, affixed to the cable linking the keyboard to a PC and to the
bottom of the keyboard, warn users that 'Continuous use of a keyboard may
cause Repetitive Stress Injuries or related injuries'. Similar warning
labels were recently introduced by Compaq, the world's largest PC
manufacturer. The labels are seen as a move by the companies to avoid
liability for future injury claims.
Already, over 2,000 injury lawsuits have been filed against computer
manufacturers in the US.
The new Microsoft keyboard, which will be available worldwide next month at
a price of around Dollars 100, is designed to allow users to maintain a more
relaxed, natural position while typing. It can be plugged into any PC that
runs Windows 3.1 or more recent versions of the Microsoft software.
The keyboard is designed to encourage users to maintain a straighter wrist
position - avoiding one of the most common causes of discomfort and
injuries.
Microsoft will also provide an 'ergonomics guide'.
'In the last 10 years, computers have dramatically changed the workplace and
the ways in which people perform their jobs,' said Rick Thompson, manager of
the hardware business unit at Microsoft.
'Yet in that time, the design of the computer keyboard has remained
virtually unchanged.'
