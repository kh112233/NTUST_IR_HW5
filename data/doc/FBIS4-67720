  [Text] The mass vaccination of children under the age of 5 
conducted by the republic's Ministry of Health with UN 
assistance is being completed in Azerbaijan. 
  Cases of poliomyelitis and diphtheria in the republic, which 
have become more frequent, represent one of the many sad signs 
of today. The system of compulsory vaccinations of children, 
which formerly was organized efficiently, like many other 
things, has collapsed. The catastrophic shortage of vaccines, 
which previously were received from Russia, and the presence of 
more than 1 million refugees are the reasons for this. 
  As we were told at the Main Administration of Sanitary and 
Epidemiological Supervision of the Ministry of Health of 
Azerbaijan, in the course of this campaign, already the second 
in succession, 900,000 children throughout the republic, not 
taking Baku into account, have received vaccinations against 
poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough. For this 
purpose more than 3,000 medical workers have been sent to 
refugee camps in all regions of Azerbaijan. The UN Children's 
Fund undertook to provide the necessary preparations and 
disposable syringes.
