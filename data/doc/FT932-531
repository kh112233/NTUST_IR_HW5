FT  28 JUN 93 / Journalist's RSI case starts today
THE FIRST legal claim brought by a journalist over repetitive strain injury
will be heard in the High Court today.
Mr Rafiq Mughal, 44, is suing his last employer, the Reuters news agency,
for compensation.
RSI is a term used to describe various disorders of the hands, arms,
shoulders and neck. Such injuries have increased in recent years following
the widespread introduction of computer keyboards in workplaces.
Mr Mughal, who became severely affected with RSI in 1988, has not worked for
the past four years and claims that he has lost more than Pounds 85,000 in
salary.
He is backed by the NUJ journalists' union, which has a large number of
pending RSI cases that are likely to be affected by the outcome of this
week's hearing. The pending cases include a small number of current and
former Financial Times journalists.
Mr Mughal said he has suffered 'terrible pain' and is still unable to carry
out simple household tasks.
He added: 'New technology has been introduced at great speed with little or
no consideration for the health and welfare of those who use it.
