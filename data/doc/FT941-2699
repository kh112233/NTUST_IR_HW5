FT  19 MAR 94 / Six airlines agree not to use 'price-fixing' system
Six US airlines have agreed not to use a computerised fare information
system to communicate proposed fare changes, following federal government
allegations that the system amounted to a price-fixing ring.
The US Justice Department had accused the carriers - American Airlines,
Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Trans World
Airlines and Alaska Airlines - of using the system to exchange coded
messages about planned fare changes.
The department said the system, run by the industry-owned Airline Tariff
Pulishing Company, amounted to an 'electronic smoke-filled room' used by
airlines to float fare changes, receive counter-proposals, and reach
consensus on the amount and timing of price cuts or increases.
The department's anti-trust suit alleged that one airline might signal its
intention to reduce fares on one of its competitor's most lucrative routes,
only to receive a threat from the competitor to cut fares on the first
airline's most profitable routes. Often, the result was a decision to
abandon the fare cuts or reach an accommodation, the department said.
The airlines said the continuing fare war in the US domestic market showed
the allegations were baseless, and travel agents said the absence of
information on planned fare changes would make it more difficult for people
to plan travel.
The airlines stopped the practice when the suit was filed more than a year
ago, and agreed not to re-start.
