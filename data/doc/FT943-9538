FT  10 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: New index for ASX tourism and leisure
The Australian Stock Exchange, which is in the process of revamping the
stock market's indices, unveiled a new 'tourism and leisure' index this
week. At the outset, this will cover nine stocks with a current market
capitalisation of ADollars 3.6bn.
The ASX said the move reflected worries that a lack of information on the
returns notched up by the tourism sector might be restraining investment.
The new index, it said, would provide an easily accessible yardstick. The
tourism business is expanding fairly rapidly in Australia at present, helped
by a surge in casino developments, Asian tourist trade, and the decision to
let Sydney host the Olympic Games in the year 2000.
The nine stocks which will make up the index at the outset include AAPC (the
Accor Asia hotel group), a number of casino companies such as Burswood,
Crown Casino and Jupiters, as well as Sea World, Village Roadshow and
Hamilton Island.
The ASX said they are likely to be augmented in the future as other
tourism-related stocks come to the equity market. Likely inclusions are
Qantas, the Australian airline which the federal government is due to
privatise next year, the Sydney Casino, and TABcorp, which runs a chain of
betting shops in Victoria and is being privatised by the state government
there at present.
For inclusion in the index, companies must have a market capitalisation of
more than ADollars 60m, be members of the All-Ordinaries index, get most of
their profits from tourism or leisure, and have stock turnover of at least
0.5 per cent per month for three months.
Last month, the ASX launched a new 'ASX100' index, covering the 100 top
stocks in the market. It plans to bring in a range of large, mid-cap, and
small company indices later this year. There is strong competition between
exchanges in the Asia-Pacific regions, and a growing realis-ation that
active marketing efforts are necessary to secure investors' dollars.
