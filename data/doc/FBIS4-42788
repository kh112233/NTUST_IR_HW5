  [Text] Ankara -- Turkey is preparing to retaliate against 
Greece, which has recently created a wave of tension in 
relations between the two countries by supporting the Kurdish 
Workers Party militants, making an effort to extend its 
territorial waters in the Aegean Sea to 12 miles, and 
maintaining an intransigent approach on the Cyprus problem. In 
a surprise move, Turkey has decided to extend the Gokceada 
Airport's short runway to accommodate jet aircraft. Meanwhile, a 
small airport will be constructed in Bozcaada. 
<H5>  Gokceada Airport's Runway </H5>
  The General Staff conveyed a written request to the Ministry 
of Communications and Transport for the extension of Gokceada 
Airport's runway some time ago. The ministry has complied by 
deciding to dispatch a group of experts to the island to start 
the work on the runway during the current week. 
<H5>  National Security Council Assesses the Situation </H5>
  The National Security Council [NSC] met on 28 May to assess 
Greece's approach, which has created tension in the relations 
between the two countries. The NSC also established the 
measures Turkey can adopt to deal with the situation. The 
meeting discussed the possibility of the extension of Gokceada 
Airport's runway and the construction of an airport in Bozcaada. 
The General Staff later conveyed a written request to the 
Ministry of Communications and Transport for the extension of 
the runway. 
<H5>  Kostepen Takes Quick Action </H5>
  In a statement to HURRIYET, Minister of Communications and 
Transport Kostepen has confirmed the decision to extend the 
runway. He said that the 1,200-meter long runway will be 
extended to at least 2,040 meters and that a group of experts 
will be dispatched to the island during the current week. 
Kostepen noted: "The runway will be extended for logistical 
purposes and for meeting requirements in the tourism sector." 
  Kostepen asserted that the runway will be used by civilian 
aircraft after it is extended. He noted that the use of the 
Gokceada Airport by civilian aircraft will promote tourism in 
the region. Kostepen added that plans have been made for the 
construction of a small airport in Bozcaada. Regarding Gokceada 
Airport, he said: "The runway is not used at the present time. 
Gokceada is important for the tourism sector. It is also a 
strategically important island." 
  The status of the islands in the Aegean Sea has been 
outlined 
in international agreements. That is why Greece claimed in the 
past that it would enlarge the airport in Meyisti island and 
construct airports on the other Greek islands for civilian 
purposes.
