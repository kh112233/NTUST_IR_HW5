FT  08 JUL 93 / World News in Brief: Home secretary defends exclusion order
Home secretary Michael Howard was satisfied that John Matthews, 22, was
involved in terrorism, the Home Office announced last night. Mr Matthews was
yesterday escorted to Belfast by two officials under an exclusion order,
despite earlier being cleared by magistrates of an attempted taxi bomb
attack on Downing Street. Material inadmissible as court evidence had been
studied by the Home Office, a statement said.
