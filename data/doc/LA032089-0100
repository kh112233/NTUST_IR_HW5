'THIN BLUE LINE' PRISONER FREED 
A judge today ordered the release of Randall Dale Adams, who was imprisoned for 
12 years for the slaying of a police officer but whose guilt was questioned in 
the film "The Thin Blue Line." 
Adams, who was released on a $50,000 personal recognizance bond, had been 
convicted in the 1976 slaying of Dallas Police Officer Robert Wood. Originally 
sentenced to death, Adams' sentence was commuted to life in 1980. His 
conviction was unanimously overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on 
March 1.
