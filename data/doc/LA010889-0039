TRIP OF THE WEEK: A GRAY WHALE OF A TALE 
An estimated 18,000 or more gray whales are making their annual swim from 
Alaska to the lagoons of Baja California as Southlanders migrate to local ports 
for whale-watch excursions. 
The watchers may not spot those two TV-star gray whales that were temporarily 
trapped in the frozen Bering Sea late last year, but there's a good chance 
they'll see other likable leviathans. 
Some nature lovers opt for long voyages around the Baja peninsula into the Sea 
of Cortez in the hope of encountering more whales -- humpback, fin, Bryde's, 
orca and the enormous blue. Whale-watchers also will explore the islands and 
mainland of rugged Baja, which has been called the Galapagos of North America. 
Boats will depart through April from 10 ports between Santa Barbara and San 
Diego in search of gray whales. Most are sportfishing vessels that carry from 
80 to 145 passengers. Largest are Catalina Cruises' triple-decked ferries that 
can carry 525 whale watchers. 
Narrations Given 
Excursions average 2 to 3 1/2 hours, but trips to the Channel or Coronado 
islands last longer. Since whale traffic is difficult to predict, the boat 
operator decides if a "whale check" for another trip will be given to 
passengers if a whale isn't sighted. 
Naturalists or volunteer guides from the Cabrillo Marine Museum or American 
Cetacean Society narrate on some vessels about the whales and other marine 
life. In most cases, however, it is the boat captain who gives the commentary. 
For close-up views when the whales spout, fluke and breach, use binoculars and 
a telephoto lens for your camera. Also dress warmly. Pack a few refreshments if 
your boat doesn't have a galley that sells snacks and drinks. 
Departure times vary, but usually there are more frequent excursions on 
weekends and holidays. 
Tickets for whale watching average $9 to $11 for adults, $6 to $8 for children. 
Sometimes fares are less on weekdays and for senior citizens.

Baja Lagoons: For closer encounters with California gray whales, longer trips 
depart from San Diego to San Ignacio and Scammons lagoons along Baja's Pacific 
coast. That's where the whales end their migration to mate and give birth. 
Limit People Contact 
These once-endangered creatures seem to relax at the completion of their 
5,000-mile swim. A number of them have been dubbed "friendlies" because they 
come alongside skiffs that are lowered from the excursion vessels. Passengers 
can reach out and pet the barnacle-encrusted mothers and their newborn 
offspring. 
To protect the whales from excessive human contact in the lagoons that are 
their age-old breeding and calving grounds, the Mexican government limits the 
number of boats that can enter. Currently, seven U.S. vessels have permission 
to visit San Ignacio and Scammons lagoons, and those sportfishing boats are 
based in San Diego. 
At H&amp;M Landing are the Spirit of Adventure and Champ, while the Royal Star, 
Royal Polaris, Searcher, Qualifier and Pacific Queen operate from Fisherman's 
Landing. From now into April, they make seven- to 11-day excursions that also 
visit wilderness islands along Baja's Pacific side. 
On Todos Santos, San Martin, San Benito and Cedros islands, you'll see a rich 
array of animal, bird and plant life, including elephant seals, magnificent 
frigatebirds and desert wildflowers. The boat or tour staff includes 
naturalists who identify the flora and fauna. 
These natural-history expeditions to the gray whale lagoons are organized by 
boat operators and tour agencies or groups that charter the vessels. Departure 
dates and tour prices vary considerably; cost from San Diego averages $140 per 
person per day, meals included.
