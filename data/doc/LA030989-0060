A House committee gave party-line approval to legislation that would require 
large employers to provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave for parents to take 
care of newborn or seriously ill children. The bill, a major part of 
congressional Democrats' domestic agenda, also would require companies with 50 
or more employees to grant similar leave to workers who need extended time off 
to take care of ailing parents. The measure cleared the House Education and 
Labor Committee on a 23-12 vote at the end of a daylong meeting in which the 
panel beat back about two dozen Republican-sponsored amendments.
