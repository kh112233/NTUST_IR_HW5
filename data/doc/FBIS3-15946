  [Text] Drafting Tallinn's 1994 budget is very difficult as 
the city's expected income has decreased almost twice, Tiit Vhi, 
ex-premier and the current council chairman of Estonian capital, 
told ETA on Thursday [10 March]. In 1993, Tallinn's income was 
almost one billion kroons, but this year only some 525 million 
kroons are expected to be collected from taxes. 
  "The state tied Tallinn's hands behind the back and took 
away 
its wallet," Vhi said while adding that 81 percent of taxes go 
to the state while only 19 percent is left at the disposal of 
local self-government. 
  Tallinn produces 76 percent of the country's sales tax and 
entrepreneur's tax and half of private persons' income tax while 
only one third of the country's population lives in Estonia, 
Jaak Tamm, the Mayor of Tallinn, told ETA. 
  Tallinn is more or less Estonia's tax base, Tamm said while 
accusing the government in attempts to revitalise centralization. 
  "The importance of the state is continually growing along 
with the centralization of resources and their state-controlled 
distribution -- planned economy in its essence," Tamm said.
