PACIFIC NOTES 
A subsidiary of U.S. computer maker Atari Corp. has been indicted in Taiwan on 
charges of using pirated copies of software programs. 
A criminal indictment for copyright infringement was handed down against Atari 
Taiwan Manufacturing Corp. and two employees this month, according to the 
Business Software Alliance, a coalition of U.S. software companies. 
A court-ordered search of the company in April turned up what prosecutors 
allege were unauthorized copies of Ashton Tate's dBase III Plus software and 
Lotus Development Corp.'s Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet program. 
Atari said the programs were used by the two employees against company policy. 
Since the case involved only about a dozen allegedly pirated copies, the 
company accused the Business Software Alliance of blowing it out of proportion. 
"We fight this kind of (piracy) all the time," said August Liguori, vice 
president of finance. "It would be foolish for us to cheat our own peers over a 
few hundred dollars." 
The case is part of a high-profile campaign by the alliance to crack down on 
those who illegally copy programs for their own use or for sale. Software 
piracy, which is particularly bad overseas, costs developers $16 billion a year 
in lost revenue, according to the alliance.
