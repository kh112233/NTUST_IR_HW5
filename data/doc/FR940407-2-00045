project(s) does not contribute, or does contribute to 
adverse and beneficial cumulative effects on resources 
and therefore should be excluded from further study or 
excluded from further consideration of cumulative 
impacts within the river basin. Documentation should 
include, but be not limited to: how the project(s) 
interact with other projects within the river basin or 
other developmental activities; results from studies; 
resource management policies; and, reports from 
federal, state, and local agencies. 

FERC staff will be issuing shortly the Scoping Document for 
the preparation of the Salmon River Project Environmental 
Assessment. Comments concerning the scope of the 
environmental assessment should be filed by the deadline 
date.

Description of Project:

 The proposed pumped storage project 
would consist of: (1) An upper reservoir having a 580-acre 
surface area and a 26,000-acre-foot storage capacity at water 
surface elevation 680 feet msl, created by a 225-foot-high, 
9,800-foot-long dam, a 95-foot-high, 700-foot-long dike, 
and a 35-foot-high, 1,300-foot-long dike; (2) a 300-foot-long, 
110-foot-wide channel leading to a submerged intake 
structure; (3) a shaft and tunnel trifurcating into three 
20-foot-diameter steel-lined tunnels; (4) an underground 
powerhouse containing three reversible pump-turbine units 
rated at 330MW each operated at a 450-foot head; (5) a 
1,500-foot-long powerhouse access tunnel and an 18-foot-diameter vent and cable shaft; (6) three concrete-lined

tunnels leading to an outlet structure in Lake Clarke; 
(7) an above-ground switchyard; (8) a three-mile-long, 
250-kV transmission line; and (9) appurtenant facilities. 
Lake Clarke, an existing reservoir formed by the Safe Harbor 
Dam (FERC Project No. 1025) would be utilized as a lower 
reservoir. 

Core boring of the foundation overburden and underlying 
rock formation would be required. Applicant estimates 
that the cost of the studies under the terms of the permit 
would be $235,000. Project energy would be purchased 
from and sold to local utilities. A portion of the 
proposed project boundary for Project No. 11446 lies 
within the approved project boundary for licensed project 
No. 1025. However, the proposed project facilities could 
be mutually compatible.

Description of Project:

 The proposed project would utilize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' existing Dalles dam and 
consist of: (1) a 10-foot-diameter, 30-foot-long penstock 
within the dam which is part of the dam's fish passage 
facilities; and (2) a powerhouse containing a generating 
unit with a capacity of 3.6 kW and an average annual 
generation of 26.0 GWh. 

No new access road will be needed to conduct the studies. 
The applicant estimates that the cost of the studies to be 
conducted under the preliminary permit would be $180,000.
