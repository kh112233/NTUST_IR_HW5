FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Assessing international risks - A
look at ways to calculate just how well emerging market and specialist funds
perform
The darlings of the international investment world are emerging market and
specialist funds (technology and special opportunities). Which are the best
managed funds over the last four years? As I did with global growth funds *,
I have used two minimum performance criteria. Good fund managers must beat
the total return on the FT-A World ex-Japan, and must exceed the ratio of a
fund's risk to its return - the figure for the FT-A World ex-Japan index is
0.21.
Those funds that have passed the twin tests have been split into three
groups. These groupings reflect each fund's true investment orientation. A
further group, ethical funds, have not been included. Their histories are
too short.
The fact that we have highlighted nine of the 18 funds that qualify for our
survey tells a simple tale; this sub-sector bristles with talent. To many
this will not be a revelation since the technology and emerging market funds
have dominated the total return rankings of the International Growth sector
for the last three years.
Do not, however, be fooled into thinking that buying a technology or
emerging market fund is plain sailing. Two technology funds (Allied Dunbar
and Barclays) have poor records, and Gartmore's Frontier markets fund is a
relative dullard among emerging stars. The special opportunities subsector
is still worse with five underperformers.
Emerging market and specialists funds are a tad risky. Compared to the
average international growth fund, technology and emerging market funds are
respectively 39 per cent and 47 per cent more volatile. Most of these funds
are described as high risk although there is the odd exception. Scottish
Equitable Technology's occasionally sizeable use of cash as a safe haven,
for instance, is one reason why it has a risk rating that is only average
(its risk score is 1.1 or 10 per cent riskier than the sector average).
In contrast, special opportunities funds as a class look secure. Their
cyclical nature and lower returns mean they are only 17 per cent riskier
than the average International Growth trust.
Risk in itself is not a bad thing. It is only bad when it goes unrewarded.
By adjusting each fund's returns to take into account this risk, it is
possible to produce a risk / return score which indicates how the manager
has juggled the risks and rewards of the portfolio.
High return funds such as Framlington Health, Prosperity Emerging Markets
and City of London Emerging Markets, all of which carry the highest risk
warning (Very High), come out looking good. In each case the high risk /
return scores of these funds indicates that the high risks have been
justified by spectacularly high returns.
By contrast, the Very High risk incurred by Prolific Technology and
Henderson TR Global Technology has not been rewarded to the same degree.
Looking at this another way, a manager's success in managing a high risk /
return trade-off is valuable because it is evidence of ability.
It is also quite valuable when investing in high risk funds to be able to
pinpoint managers who are as adept at managing risk as they are with return.
The high risk / return of Perpetual's International Emerging Companies fund,
for instance, is the product of high returns relative to the benchmark but
less than interstellar risk as well. Better still, Scottish Equitable's
Technology fund has achieved its risk / return figure through a combination
of highish returns (a benchmark score of 1.37 is not to be sniffed at) and
moderate risk.
It is also important that the risk / return figure of a fund is not read in
isolation. Investors must still sift through the rest of our findings to get
a complete picture. For example, you may yearn for a technology fund and on
our rankings, the high risk / return score of Framlington Health might
suggest this fund for consideration. But look again. This fund has an
erratic total return record. The reason? It is virtually a US rather than a
global fund and is tied to the fortunes of the US market.
If you prefer a technology fund with defensive qualities, the four
year-on-year returns relative to the benchmark may be proof that Scottish
Equitable would suit. But this fund's record also shows evidence of a
trade-off between stability and total return.
Judging the records of our two emerging market funds is no simple matter
either. For in spite of the similarities between their four-year total
returns, one appears to be more defensive than the other. When, for example,
world equities took a tumble in 1990, City of London lost less than the
benchmark, whereas Prosperity slipped back a good deal further. And while
Prosperity's fortunes took off in 1991, the relative sluggishness of City of
London's pick-up suggests that both its heavier bias towards Latin America
and its individual character (it invests only in the shares of emerging
market investment trusts) make it less correlated with the rest of the world
than Prosperity's fund.
The one special opportunities fund that can hold its own against the likes
of emerging and techno stars offers a little of everything. Perpetual's
International Emerging Companies fund combines a bit of emerging markets,
technology, special situations and a lot of high quality stock selection
too. Other funds provide some interesting combinations too. GT Worldwide
Special Situations, for instance, includes a substantial technology element,
while most of the technology funds like to invest in emerging markets as
well.
Whatever your interest in International Growth trusts, to judge past
performance it is vital to take the risk / return of a fund, its causes and
its investment orientation into account. Our classifications have been
designed with these considerations in mind.

1993. The reference to GAM International in the piece should have read GAM
Sterling and International.

Key to table: Years are November-to-November. NB The four year total is
based upon monthly percentage changes so does not sum to the four
year-on-year totals. The Benchmark column shows the arithmetic
difference between the fund's return and the index's return. The BM or
benchmark ratio expresses the percentage outperformance by the fund over
the four years. Risk is total risk or volatility. Total risk is measured
by the monthly standard deviation over four years to November 30. Risk
relative to sector is each fund's standard deviation divided by the
sector's average standard deviation of 4.52. Risk/return is the division
of the four year average monthly total return by the four year standard
deviation of monthly returns. Return data is offer-to-offer, net income
reinvested. Source: HSW. Other calculations: J Cuthbert.
