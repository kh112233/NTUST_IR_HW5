  [Excerpts] A Civil Guard was shot dead this morning in a 
terrorist attack carried out in the Valle de Trapaga near 
Bilbao. The police are looking for a woman and another two 
people who fled the scene. Felisa Aldai reports from Bilbao: 
  [Aldai] The 39-year-old civil guard, Benigno Villalobos 
Blanco, died in what appears to have been the latest attack 
carried out by the ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] terrorist 
group. Benigno Lobos was leaving his home at around 0800 when, 
acording to eyewitnesses, he was shot at by two men and a woman 
who fled the scene in a Fiat car with Santander numberplates. 
[passage omitted] 
  This attack takes place only 24 days after the ETA terrorist 
group killed another civil guard in Bilbao, Fernando Jimenez 
Pascual. On this occasion the terrorist group planted a 
powerful explosive under his car. This latest attack would seem 
to point to the existence of a new reorganized ETA Vizcaya 
commando.
