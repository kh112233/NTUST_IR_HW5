FT  05 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Moscow metro
Four people were injured in the Moscow metro last Thursday in the second
accident to hit the underground rail network, once a byword for safety and
reliability, in two days. Last Wednesday nine people were taken to hospital
when carriages that had become disconnected clashed. Metro officials have
complained that they were finding it increasingly difficult to maintain
safety standards as the government and Moscow authorities had failed to
provide adequate funding over the past three years.
