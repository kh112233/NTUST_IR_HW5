SCIENTISTS HARNESSING BODY'S NATURAL AGENTS AS POWERFUL HEALERS 
Instead of the sharp edge of the scalpel or a massive blast of toxic chemicals 
to wipe out illness, doctors are turning to the body to heal itself. 
They are taking the body's natural products -- hormones, antibodies, enzymes 
and even whole cells -- to attack disease and restore normal functioning. 
Cancer, Parkinson's disease, heart disorders and hormone deficiencies are all 
the targets of this new approach to treating illness. 
Harnessing these new "natural" agents produced by the body might be called 
biological therapy, or biotherapy, much as toxic chemicals used to treat cancer 
are called chemotherapy. 
It all started with the genetic-engineering revolution in the 1970s when 
scientists learned how to manipulate genes in the laboratory. Previously rare 
human proteins -- interferon, interleukin-2, human insulin and human-growth 
factor -- could suddenly be mass produced with these new gene-engineering 
techniques. Although the early experiments in human patients failed to live up 
to expectations, solid gains have been made and physicians remain optimistic 
about the role of biotherapies. 
"In the next decade, the major advance will be genetic therapies," said Bruce 
A. Chabner, director of the National Cancer Institute's division of cancer 
treatment. Genetic manipulation, for example, is being increasingly studied as 
a way to fight diseases such as cancer and AIDS. 
The idea of biotherapies has been around for decades, though the first ones 
were crude. Cow insulin, a protein essential for signaling cells to pull sugar 
from the blood, was discovered in the 1920s and injected into the bodies of 
diabetics. 
Vaccination -- the injection of a living but inactive virus or bacteria into 
the body -- showed that it was possible to manipulate the body's natural 
defenses. The immune system was programmed to prevent subsequent infection by 
that particular bacteria or virus. 
Just before World War II, doctors discovered that blood could be transfused 
between individuals. And beginning in the 1960s came the organ transplants -- 
heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, kidney, even bone marrow. 
The common factor between these now standard treatments is that they use 
natural substances -- cells in the transfusion, organs in the transplants, 
viruses in the vaccines, protein in the insulin. But they are limited. Blood 
doesn't always match; organs are rejected; improperly prepared vaccines can 
cause the disease they were intended to prevent. 
Most of the problems came from incomplete understanding of the biology. The new 
generation of biotherapies is changing that, putting in doctors' hands some of 
the most powerful treatments ever developed. Biotherapies fall, generally, into 
three groups: proteins, genes and cells. 
In the last five years, physicians have been putting to use the natural 
medicines produced for the first time by the biotechnology labs. Genetic 
engineers have learned to put specific human genes into bacteria, turning the 
bacteria into miniature factories that grow large quantities of the human 
proteins doctors can use against a certain disease. The new protein 
biotherapies include: 
* Clot busters. Several natural proteins have been found that rapidly dissolve 
blood clots. Physicians now routinely inject these clot busters to stop heart 
attacks in mid-attack -- something that never had been possible. Additionally, 
these drugs also have been used experimentally to stop strokes and open painful 
blockages in leg arteries. 
* Blood boosters. A set of proteins has been found that stimulate the bone 
marrow to produce both red blood cells and certain types of white blood cells. 
Growing red blood cells is revolutionizing the care for end-stage renal 
failure, which causes the body to stop making blood. Before this discovery, 
these patients needed constant transfusions. 
Stimulating white blood cells boosts immunity to various types of infections. 
It can prevent some of the secondary diseases associated with AIDS. Its most 
important use, however, may be the countering of the immune-destroying effects 
of cancer chemotherapy, thus allowing physicians to treat tumors with larger 
doses of the poisonous drugs and kill the cancer. 
* Height control. Human-growth factor can literally add inches to children of 
short stature. They don't always reach normal height, but they reach heights 
previously impossible. Some also have talked about using this powerful hormone 
for weight loss, and there have been reports of use by some athletes seeking an 
extra edge. 
* Antibodies. The body's immune system produces thousands of different-shaped 
proteins called antibodies that recognize invading bacteria and viruses by 
their shape -- and then attack them. Scientists have learned how to make 
antibodies of any given type -- called monoclonal antibodies -- that can be 
used to diagnose disease both in the lab and in the body and can be used to 
attack cancer cells directly. 
Organ transplants and blood transfusions have led the way in the use of living 
cells or tissues to treat an illness. But the new biotherapies take it all a 
quantum leap further. 
* Brain transplants. Clearly the brain itself cannot be transplanted, but parts 
of the brain wear out for uncertain reasons. Parkinson's disease arises with 
the loss of certain brains cells that produce a chemical needed for normal 
movement. Neurosurgeons have now experimented with transplanting into the brain 
patches of human cells that produce the missing chemical. Preliminary 
experiments with nerve cells taken from aborted fetuses reportedly show 
promise. 
* Tissue transplants. In diabetes, pancreatic cells stop secreting the protein 
insulin. Although insulin can be injected every day, control of blood sugar is 
better when a pancreas is transplanted into the body. A number of human 
experiments are under way to inject just the insulin-making cells in the hope 
that they will work better and be easier to protect from rejection. 
* Killing cancer. Researchers at the National Cancer Institute have found that 
certain white blood cells are primed to attack cancers. They remove those cells 
and stimulate them in the lab with a growth factor called interleukin-2. Once 
several billion of the white blood cells have grown in the lab, they are put 
back into the patient's body and attack the tumor. More than half of the 
patients with the skin cancer malignant melanoma and with kidney cancer now 
respond to this treatment. 
The third general form of biotherapy, genetic, relies on the recent ability to 
insert genes into cells of the body. Genes control the production of proteins, 
so gene transfers can be used to replace a missing protein permanently. This is 
the future of medicine, many believe. About 4,000 inherited diseases could be 
attacked by this technology. 
* First steps. In the first gene transfer experiments in humans, begun last 
year at the National Institutes of Health, cancer researchers put a bacterial 
gene into the white blood cells they already had been turning into cancer 
killers. The gene allows them to track the altered blood cells in the body and 
to see which type best kills the cancer. Future experiments in which other 
genes are added should boost the cell's cancer-killing power. 
* Artificial organs. The biggest problem with gene therapy is getting the 
altered cells back into the body so that they survive. One approach under 
development in animals creates an artificial organ by growing the gene-modified 
cells on a synthetic pad that is surgically placed in the animal's abdomen. 
Hormones are added that make blood vessels grow into the pad. Theoretically, 
the newly created organ could be designed to secrete any protein to treat a 
wide array of illnesses. 
Although the new biotherapies have begun to radically alter the treatment of 
disease, they also have created controversies. For example, some of the tissue 
transplanted for diabetes and Parkinson's comes from aborted fetuses. Groups 
opposed to abortion have so strongly opposed the use of this material that the 
government no longer funds any related research. 
The debate will grow more intense as the massive project to identify and 
analyze every single human gene, now being developed at NIH, gets under way. It 
will speed the ability to detect diseases for which nothing can be done. That 
means doctors will be able to tell which patients are likely to get which 
diseases. Will patients want to know?
