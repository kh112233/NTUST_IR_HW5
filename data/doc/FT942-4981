FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: BAA plans Pounds 1bn Heathrow outlay
The bulk of BAA's future capital spending will go to Heathrow, the world's
largest international passenger airport, which will absorb Pounds 1bn of the
planned Pounds 1.4bn expenditure over the next three years. Capital spending
totalled Pounds 681m in the last three years.
Gatwick airport will absorb Pounds 214m, while spending programmes at BAA's
Scottish airports will involve Pounds 107m with a further Pounds 70m at
Stansted over the next three years.
Capital programmes include the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express rail link; a new
baggage screening system costing more than Pounds 100m to install throughout
the company's airports; expansion and modernisation of departure lounges and
check-in halls as well as airport retailing facilities involving about
Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m for each lounge; a new flight connection centre
between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 at Heathrow, and preparatory work for
Heathrow's new Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m Terminal 5 project.
If BAA wins the Terminal 5 planning inquiry, it will face continued heavy
spending after 1997 when construction of the terminal would begin.
The airports group expects only a modest impact on its business from the
opening of the Channel Tunnel with a loss of about 2m passengers in 1995-96
when the tunnel becomes fully operational.
