  [Text] Recently, the Sichuan and Guizhou provincial 
governments formally approved the "Chishui He Trunk Hydropower 
Program Report" and decided that the two provinces will jointly 
develop the hydropower resources of the trunk of the Chishui He. 
  The Chishui He is an important river that flows through 
southern Sichuan and northern Guizhou. The focus for developing 
its trunk is: power generation in the upper reaches, integration 
of power generation and shipping on its middle reaches, and 
developing shipping on its lower reaches. There are 10 cascade 
hydropower stations planned for the entire trunk with a total 
installed generating capacity of 830MW and annual power output 
of 3.86 billion kWh.
