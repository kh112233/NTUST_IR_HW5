FT  06 MAR 92 / Four African states offer deal if ivory ban relaxed
THE southern African governments pushing for a relaxation of the world ivory
trade ban announced yesterday that they would drop demands for export
permission now if granted more control over their elephant herds, writes
Robert Thomsom in Tokyo.
A joint statement by the governments of Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and
Malawi at the triennial conference of the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species (Cites) in Kyoto was made as it became clear that a
majority of the 114 member states opposed a lifting of the ivory ban.
The ivory issue is one of the most emotional at the two-week conference,
which will also toughen or relax protection of a wide range of other flora
and fauna, and attempt to set clearer standards for assessing whether a
particular species is endangered.
Instead of a total ban on ivory trade, the four governments want a
'voluntary moratorium' for a 'reasonable period.'
They asked for 'time to put in place a trading system that would not
encourage any illegal opportunities for ivory trading,' but made clear that
they expected a limited trade to be legalised in the longer term.
Dr Simon Lyster, international treaties officer for the World Wide Fund for
Nature (WWF), said the four countries are moving 'in the right direction,'
but that the WWF is concerned by the proposal for a voluntary moratorium on
the ivory trade.
'WWF wants an ivory ban guaranteed by Cites and which can only be changed
with the consent of two-thirds of the parties to Cities,' he said.
A vote on whether to relax controls on elephants is likely early next week,
and many delegates to the conference have yet to make clear whether they
will vote in favour of allowing trade in elephant skins and meat. The four
governments argue that they should at least be allowed to trade in non-ivory
products.
