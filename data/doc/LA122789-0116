WORLD; 
SOVIET'S ROUSSEAU WORK STOLEN 
A masterpiece by the 19th-Century French painter Theodore Rousseau has been 
stolen in a daring heist from a museum in the central Soviet city of Penza, it 
was reported today. 
The work, "Before a Thunderstorm," was taken from the Central Picture Gallery 
in Penza, an industrial city of 540,000 about 450 miles southeast of Moscow. It 
had been hanging there since 1891. 
Rousseau (1812-1867) was a leader of a group of landscape painters known 
collectively as the Barbizon School. "Before a Thunderstorm" is a prized 
example of his depiction of nature as a wild and undisciplined force. 
"The crime is an extraordinary one," Yuri Igonin, deputy chief of internal 
affairs, told Sovietskaya Rossiya newspaper. He said there was a sloppy 
response to the heist by the local militia, who responded to the break-in alarm 
by merely telephoning the guards at the gallery.
