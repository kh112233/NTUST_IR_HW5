  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG President Richard von Weizsaecker 
conveyed most "cordial congratulations" to Nelson Mandela on his 
election as new South African president. In a letter published 
in Bonn on Monday [9 May], Weizsaecker stated that the great 
mark of confidence in the free and fair elections means the 
recognition of Mandela's dedicated struggle against the inhumane 
apartheid system and his exemplary preparedness for 
reconciliation and compromise. "You have gained a great victory 
for all of mankind," Weizsaecker wrote. "In the democratic 
development and the economic shaping of the new South Africa, 
you can build on our continuous support."
