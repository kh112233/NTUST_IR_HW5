NOBEL PEACE PRIZE AWARDED TO GORBACHEV 
It is tragically ironic that the Nobel Peace Prize, which has honored in the 
past some of the greatest champions of justice and models of virtue, has fallen 
this year upon Gorbachev, the man who chose to use force to suppress the 
Lithuanian democratic uprising, one of Eastern Europe's most peaceful 
revolutions of the last year. 
Armed only with their national songs and tri-color flags, the Lithuanians took 
to the streets and polling booths to express their intentions of regaining 
their rightful independence which was stolen in 1940; yet Gorbachev responded 
by ordering Soviet tanks to roll through the streets of Vilnius. 
It was Gorbachev who insisted on strangling the nation by shutting off its gas 
lines and cutting off vital medical supplies. It was Gorbachev who allowed Red 
Army soldiers to storm Red Cross hospitals in Lithuania, seize Lithuanian 
youths who had fled their occupier's army and beat them into submission. By 
choosing to overlook Gorbachev's stomping of the human spirit and violations of 
human rights, the Nobel committee has greatly compromised the ideals which the 
prize represents. 
The Nobel Prize committee should be honoring a noble people, the Lithuanians, 
instead of the man who continues their oppression.
