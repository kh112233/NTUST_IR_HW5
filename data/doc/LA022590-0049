SEX EDUCATION DEPENDS ON SPECIFICS 
Dr. Neil Solomon's column on Jan. 26 was a demonstration of how physician 
unresponsiveness contributes to the spread of the AIDS virus and other sexually 
transmitted diseases (and pregnancies). 
A writer asked Dr. Solomon for specifics on safe sex for a 14-year-old. 
Instead of giving the information that was requested, he replied that 
abstinence was appropriate and "a 14-year-old should not have to struggle with 
the erroneous assumption that it's normal to have sex." 
No information was given about condoms and spermicides. No referral was given 
to a local AIDS agency. He merely added that adolescents "should know the facts 
about sex, contraceptives, sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy." The 
writer had complained about prior vague comments and requested specific advice. 
None was given. 
Instead, Dr. Solomon ignored the fact that some 14-year-olds do have sex. 
Further, he confirmed that many physicians demonstrate no responsibility to 
provide specific information on low risk sex for those who do decide to become 
sexually active. 
No wonder our teen-agers remain at high risk.
