  [Text] Prague Jan 6 (CTK) -- "We are convinced that the 
International Court at The Hague will reverse the Czech 
Constitutional Court decision validating the law on 
anti-communist resistance and the illegality of the communist 
regime," a leading legal expert of the Communist Party of 
Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) told journalists today. KSCM experts 
consider the law to be in violation of the Czech Constitution, 
Vojtech Filip said. 
  The law is based on the idea of collective responsibility 
and 
collective guilt, he said, adding that it violates a ban on 
discrimination incorporated into a number of international 
standards recognised by the Czech Republic. 
  The law also allows the punishment of deeds considered legal 
under the former regime and those which would otherwise be no 
longer punishable, Filip said, adding he believed there would be 
no new stage trials. Should it come to that, the KSCM will 
provide the accused with legal aid irrespective of their 
political affiliation, religion or race.
