FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Health boost
A NEW RANGE of private health insurance plans has been launched by Clinicare
and a French insurance group, Strasbourgeoise Assurance Mutuelle. Consumers
will be offered three types of plan (in descending order of cover): Carte
Blanche, Classic and Club.
Clinicare claims the top-of-the-range Carte Blanche breaks new ground in the
range of treatment covered. As well as hospital care, it pays for
prescriptions and GP fees as well as dentists' and opticians' charges.
Alternative medicine is also available.
The Classic plan is closer to the industry norm, says Clinicare, whereas
Club offers in-patient cover but excludes benefits such as nursing at home
and physiotherapy. Clinicare also says it will offer some policy-holders
cover for pre-existing conditions if they pay an additional premium. But it
will not be offering this facility to patients with life-threatening
conditions - such as Aids.
Carte Blanche, for a married man aged 40-44 with two children, varies from
Pounds 1,598 to Pounds 2,526 a year depending on the hospital; the Club plan
would cost between Pounds 763 and Pounds 1,315.
These launches confirm an industry trend to offer an ever-wider choice of
plans, although this makes it more difficult to compare the costs of
schemes.
