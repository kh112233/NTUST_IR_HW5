FT  18 OCT 93 / Observer: Clerical error
Britain's two main opposition parties, Labour and the Liberal Democrats,
eagerly rushed out statements congratulating Nelson Mandela and FW de Klerk
on their joint winning of the Nobel peace prize on Friday.
But more haste, less speed; both spellt the South African premier's name
incorrectly.
John Smith, the Labour leader, plumped for 'de Clerk', while Sir David
Steel, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, settled on 'DeClerk'.
