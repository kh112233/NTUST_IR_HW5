FT  27 JUL 92 / S Africa to probe jail deaths
THE South African government yesterday promised an investigation into a
pathologist's claim that police had murdered prisoners in detention, Reuter
reports from Johannesburg.
Dr Jonathon Gluckman, the pathologist, has examined the bodies of about 200
people who died in custody. He said he believed 90 per cent of them had been
killed by police.
'Tragic case after tragic case goes on and on,' he said yesterday. He added:
'The lower rungs of the police are totally out of control.'
Dr Gluckman, who gave evidence at the inquest into the 1977 death of black
activist Steve Biko, made his claims in Johannesburg's Sunday Times.
Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister, said he took the allegations very
seriously but dismissed suggestions that the police were out of control. 'We
should investigate this situation further.'
A decision would be made this week on whether to set up a judicial
commission of inquiry or order attorneys general to reopen cases.
Mr Kriel said natural deaths and suicides occurred in detention. 'Deaths in
detention do occur. But to say that police are responsible for people dying
in detention is simply not true.'
