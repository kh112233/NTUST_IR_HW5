  [Text] Cairo, Feb 2 (AFP)--Egypt's main Muslim militant 
group on Wednesday warned foreign investors and tourists to 
leave the country, saying its next attacks would be "extremely 
tough." 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah said in a statement sent to AFP 
that it would have to retaliate against the "massacre" of seven 
of its members late Tuesday by police in Cairo. 
  The statement rejected the official version that the 
militants died in a shoot-out, saying that they had been "killed 
in cold blood." 
  The group has targeted tourists in its campaign against 
President Husni Mubarak's secular government which has left 
almost 200 people dead in the past two years.
