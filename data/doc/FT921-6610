FT  27 FEB 92 / Japan 'regrets' fisheries deal
JAPAN has expressed its regret about an agreement between Russia and South
Korea for South Korea to fish in waters near the Russian-held Kurile Islands
which are claimed by Japan, Stefan Wagstyl reports from Tokyo.
The islands, which lie off the northern coast of Japan, were seized by the
Soviet Union at the end of the Second World War and have since been the
subject of a territorial dispute.
Tokyo hopes the end of the Cold War could lead to serious negotiations with
Moscow over the islands. But Russian leaders have yet to go beyond
expressing wishes for a peaceful settlement of the dispute.
