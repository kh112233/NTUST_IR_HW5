  [Text] Tallinn, May 12, BNS -- Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd today 
signed in London two agreements on economic issues, the Foreign 
Ministry press service told BNS. 
  The treaty on the promotion and protection of investments 
lays down the parties' obligations and rights in reciprocal 
protection of investments. 
  The parties undertake to give allround support to the 
investments made by each other's investors and create conditions 
for them that are not less favorable than those for a third 
country's investments. 
  Both parties guarantee adequate compensation to investors in 
the event of damage to investments and promise not to 
expropriate the property of investors of the other party. The 
treaty lays down rules concerning resolving of disagreements and 
exceptions to them. 
  The treaty will be submitted for ratification in the 
parliament. It is concluded for a period of ten years and upon 
expiration of the term will be extended until one of the parties 
initiates and completes the procedures to repeal it. 
  The other agreement signed today concerns avoiding double 
taxation and preventing tax evasions. 
  The treaty lays down rules and conditions for imposing taxes 
on the income of permanent residents of both parties if those 
incomes derive from both Estonia and Great Britain. 
  The objective of the treaty is to avoid a situation when 
persons who get income in both states must also pay tax on them 
in both. It provides for exchange of information between both 
countries' competent organs to implement the treaty and prevent 
fraud. 
  After ratification of the treaty by both parties it steps 
into force with regard to Estonian taxation from the beginning 
of the next calendar year and in Great Britain from April 6, 
1995, with regard to the personal income and the capital gains 
tax and from April 1 with regard to the corporate income tax.
