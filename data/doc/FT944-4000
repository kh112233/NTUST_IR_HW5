FT  10 DEC 94 / Taylor Woodrow quits Channel rail link group
Taylor Woodrow, the property and construction company, has pulled out of
Union Link, one of the four consortia bidding to build the Pounds 2.9bn
Channel tunnel rail link with London.
The company said that it had decided to withdraw 'in view of the speculative
expenditure and on-going risks' of the project.
Bids to build and operate the link are due to be submitted by March 14 and
the winning consortium is expected to be announced late next year.
The Department of Trade and Industry has said that its decision will be
influenced by the degree of risk which the bidder is prepared to take on and
the amount of public-sector subsidy it requires.
The other members of Union Link are John Mowlem, the UK construction
company, Philip Holzman and AEG of Germany, Spie Batignolles of France and
WS Atkins, the consulting engineers. Union Link said that the nature of the
project had not changed since it was chosen as one of the four bidders in
August.
It said: 'The fact that Taylor Woodrow has gone does not remove any
particular skill which none of the other parties in the consortium possess.
We will go ahead with our bid as planned.'
The three other consortia bidding for the project are: Eurorail (BICC, GEC,
HSBC Holdings, National Westminster Bank, Seeboard, Trafalgar House); London
and Continental (Ove Arup, Bechtel, Blue Circle, Halcrow, National Express,
Virgin, Warburg); and a group including Hochtief, Costain, Nishimatsu and
Siemens.
Construction should start in early 1997 for completion in 2002.
The fast rail link will cut 30 minutes off the three-hour journey between
London and Paris.
The consortium that builds the route will also be granted a 999-year lease
to operate services.
