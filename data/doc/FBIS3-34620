  [Text] Cairo, Feb 10 (AFP) -- Suspected Islamic militants 
late Tuesday shot dead a plainclothes policeman and wounded 
three civilians outside a mosque in the southern Egyptian city 
of Asyut, police reported. 
  They said the assailants opened fire with automatic weapons 
on Officer Mahmud Ahmad as he left a mosque, adding that three 
civilians who were also leaving the building were hit as well. 
  Police launched a search of the area but the gunmen managed 
to flee. 
  The Asyut region, located 900 kilometers (600 miles) south 
of 
Cairo, has been the scene of frequent confrontations between 
security forces and Moslem militants seeking to overthrow the 
secular government of President Husni Mubarak. 
  According to an unofficial toll compiled by AFP from police 
sources, 297 people have been killed in the clashes -- including 
108 policemen and 95 fundamentalists -- since the unrest erupted 
in March 1992.
