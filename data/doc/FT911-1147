FT  08 MAY 91 / Business and the Environment: Wildlife seal of approval
The Saimaa ringed seal is the most endangered animal in Finland. But a
campaign launched in 1979 - and relaunched last November - by the Worldwide
Fund for Nature (WWF) and the University of Joensuu in eastern Finland has
saved the Saimaa seal from extinction.
The Saimaa seal campaign generates funds in a variety of ways: through the
sale of its own products such as bird houses or clothes with the WWF panda
emblem, and by sponsoring schemes whereby companies pay for the right to use
the official WWF emblem in their advertisements.
'The campaign has been successful. In 1976 there were only 100 seals left
and we have been able to increase the number to 160,' said Mauri Rautkari,
secretary general of the Finnish branch of the WWF.
The new campaign takes the scheme further. For a sum of FM25,000 (Pounds
3,600 )a year a company can symbolically adopt a seal and for FM50,000 rent
a rock where the seal rests. A whole island where the seal breeds can also
be rented by a sponsor for FM200,000.
According to the WWF, 19 Finnish companies are taking part in the recent
campaign. Only one company - Tuko, a wholesale-retail chain - has so far
rented an island while the majority of companies prefer to adopt a seal.
As well as gaining publicity for being a sponsor, a company will receive a
serialised lithograph by a well-known Finnish painter for its contribution.
The size of the lithograph varies with respect to the size of the
contribution.
'There has not been much interest from the large forest companies which have
paper and pulp mills on the lake shores and the power companies which run
hydro-electric plants. They know that the damage they inflict on the Saimaa
seal is much greater than FM200,000,' said Rautkari.
Pollution, power companies and navigation authorities cause the water levels
of the lake to fluctuate. These variations can cause the collapse of the ice
and seal lairs.
