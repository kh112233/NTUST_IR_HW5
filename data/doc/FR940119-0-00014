SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 28, 1990 (55 FR 35188), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 0B4222) had been filed by Ciba-Geigy
Corp., Seven Skyline Dr., Hawthorne, NY 105322188. The petition proposed that 178.2010 

Antioxidants and/or stabilizers for polymers

 (21 CFR 178.2010) be amended to provide for the safe use of 3,5-di-

tert

-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid triester with 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine-2,4,6-(1

use in contact with food.


FDA, in its evaluation of the safety of this additive, reviewed the safety of the additive and the chemical impurities
that may be present in the additive resulting from its manufacturing process. Although the additive itself has not
been shown to cause cancer, it has been found to contain minute amounts of unreacted ethyl acrylate, a carcinogenic
reactant used in the manufacture of the additive. Residual amounts of reactants and manufacturing aids, such as ethyl
acrylate, are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, including food additives.


I. Determination of Safety


Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A), the so-called
``general safety clause'' of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation
of the data available to FDA establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21
CFR 170.3(i)) define ``safe'' as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientist that the substance
is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.''
The anticancer or Delaney clause (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) further provides that no food additive shall be
deemed safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause
applies to the additive itself and not to impurities in the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been
shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, the additive is properly evaluated under the general
safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm
will result from the proposed use of the additive.

II. Safety of the Petitioned Use of the Additive


FDA estimates that the petitioned use of the additive 3,5-di-

tert

-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid triester with 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine-2,4,6-(1

H

,3

H

H

)-trione will result in exposure to the additive of no greater than 100 parts per billion (ppb) in the daily diet (Ref.
1).
FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic toxicological testing to be necessary to determine the safety of an additive
whose use will result in such low exposure levels (Ref. 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However,
the agency has reviewed the available toxicological data from acute toxicity studies, subchronic studies, and teratological
studies on the additive. No adverse effects were reported in these studies.
FDA has evaluated the safety of this additive under the general safety clause, considering all available data and
using risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper-bound limit of risk presented by ethyl acrylate, a carcinogenic
chemical that may be present as an impurity in the additive. This risk evaluation of the carcinogenic impurity ethyl
acrylate has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the exposure to the impurity from the proposed use of the additive; and
(2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable exposure to humans.


A. Ethyl Acrylate


Using risk assessment procedures, FDA has estimated the hypothetical worst-case exposure to ethyl acrylate from
the petitioned use of the additive in the manufacture of polyester elastomers and rubber articles for repeated use
and currently regulated uses to be 380 parts per quadrillion of the daily diet (3 kilograms), or 1 nanogram (ng) per
person per day (Ref. 1). The agency used data from the National Toxicology Program report (No. 259: 1986), a bioassay
on ethyl acrylate, to estimate the upper-bound limit of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming
from the proposed use of the additive and the level of ethyl acrylate that may be present in the additive (Ref. 3). The
results of the bioassay on ethyl acrylate demonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for rats and mice under
the conditions of the study. The test material induced squamous cell neoplasms in both sexes of F344/N rats and B6C3F

1

 mice when administered by gavage in corn oil.
Based on the potential exposure of 1 ng per person per day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime
risk from the use of the 3,5-di-

tert

-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid triester with 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine-2,4,6-(1

H

H

H

)-trione is 8.1x10

-11

, or 8.1 in 100 billion (Ref. 4). Because of the numerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate, the actual lifetime
averaged individual exposure to ethyl acrylate is expected to be substantially less than the estimated daily intake,
and therefore the calculated upper-bound limit of risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable
certainty that no harm from exposure to ethyl acrylate would result from the proposed use of 3,5-di-

tert

-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamic acid triester with 1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine-2,4,6-(1

B. Need for Specifications


The agency has also considered whether a specification is necessary to control the amount of ethyl acrylate impurity
in the food additive. The agency finds that a specification is not necessary for the following reasons: (1) Because
of the low level at which ethyl acrylate may be expected to remain as an impurity following production of the additive,
the agency would not expect this impurity to become a component of food at other than extremely small levels; and (2)
the upper-bound limit of lifetime risk from exposure to this impurity, even under worst-case assumptions, is very
low, less than 8.1 in 100 billion.


C. Conclusion on Safety


FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed use of the additive
in polyester elastomers in contact with dry food and rubber articles intended for repeated use in contact with food
is safe. Based on this information, the agency has also concluded that the additive will have the intended technical
effect. Therefore, 178.2010 should be amended as set forth below.
In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.


III. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.


IV. Objections


Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at anytime on or before February 18, 1994, file with
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objection thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objection received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
