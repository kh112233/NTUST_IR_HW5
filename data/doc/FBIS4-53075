  [Text] Nemuro, Hokkaido, May 14 KYODO -- A 48-member 
Japanese delegation left Nemuro by ship Saturday [14 May] 
morning for Etorofu Island, one of four disputed Russian islands 
claimed by Japan, under a visa-free exchange program. 
  Organizers said the group include 24 former residents of the 
island and nine members involved in a campaign for the return to 
Japan of Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai Group of 
islets. 
  The latest group of Japanese to make a visa-free visit to 
the 
Russian-held islands off Hokkaido's eastern tip will land at 
Etorofu on Sunday morning and later tour the island, the 
organizers said. 
  On Monday, the group will visit Japanese graves, a school 
and 
a fish processing plant. The group will return to Nemuro on 
Tuesday. 
  Another group returned to Nemuro Friday after two nights on 
Kunashiri under the three-year-old visa-free exchange program. 
It was the first group of the year to travel to the disputed 
islands. 
  A Russian group visited Hokkaido in April. 
  The four islands were overrun by Soviet troops at the end of 
World War II.
