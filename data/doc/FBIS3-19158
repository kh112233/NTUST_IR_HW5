  [Text] Police yesterday denied reports of a top alert at 
Larnaca Airport on Thursday [10 March] night in anticipation of 
the arrival of Carlos, the world's most wanted terrorist. 
  A senior police officer described as untrue reports issued 
earlier in the day that the Latin American terrorist, also known 
as "the Jackal," had been expected to stop over at the airport 
en route to Europe. 
  The reports said Carlos was believed to be on a flight from 
either Damascus or Cairo. Dozens of policemen and members of 
the antiterrorist squad had reportedly taken up positions in the 
airport. Policewomen were also allegedly assigned to check each 
passenger on flights from Cairo and Tel Aviv. 
  It had also been alleged that Thursday's bomb hoax 
concerning 
an Austrian airlines flight carrying U.S. Special Coordinator 
Robert Lamb was intended to divert police in the event of 
Carlos' arrival.
