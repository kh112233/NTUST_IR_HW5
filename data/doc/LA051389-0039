KEY MONEY-LAUNDERING RING SMASHED 
Authorities have smashed a $100-million-a-year money-laundering ring linked to 
a major Colombian cocaine cartel, arresting 12 people, including the 
ringleader, officials announced Friday. 
The network, allegedly headed by Guillermo Gomez, was believed to be 
responsible for sending millions of dollars out of the United States to 
Colombia and Panama. 
Officials said the ring laundered money for Jose Santa Cruz Londono, a leader 
of the Cali cartel, which reputedly operates the biggest cocaine ring in New 
York. 
The network was smashed after an investigation began last year when banks in 
Elizabeth and Paterson, N.J., reported suspicious currency transactions by 
Colombian nationals, said Edward Litchko, chief of criminal investigation for 
the Internal Revenue Service in New Jersey. 
The investigation culminated with the arrest of the 12 people, including Gomez, 
during raids in Queens, Paterson and Elizabeth that also netted $500,000 in 
cash. 
The probe was conducted by the IRS, the office of the U.S. attorney for the 
Eastern District and other law enforcement agencies. 
Eleven of the 12 defendants are Colombian nationals and the other was born in 
Puerto Rico.
