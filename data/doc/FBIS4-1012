  [Text] Shots have been reported from the vicinity of the 
Thokoza hostel on the East Rand, the site of yesterday's gun 
battle between hostel inmates and National Peacekeeping Force 
troops. 
  No injuries have been reported but the peacekeeping force is 
investigating the incident. Road blocks have been set up on all 
roads leading to Thokoza. Well-known newspaper photographer Ken 
Oosterbroek was killed in yesterday's battle. Two journalists 
and two members of the peacekeeping force were also injured in 
the incident. A peace keeping force spokesman, Col. Connie van 
Rensburg, said the possibility that STAR photographer Ken 
Oosterbroek and journalist Greg Marinovich and Juda Ngwenya were 
shot by peacekeeping force members was being investigated. 
Journalists on the scene denied allegations by the police that 
they acted irresponsibly. 
  One of the journalists Joao Silva alleged that a 
peacekeeping 
force soldier panicked and just started shooting.
