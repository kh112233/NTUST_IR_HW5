FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (18): Back on track after unrest -
Tourism
SUCH has been the revival in Sri Lanka's tourist industry that enthusiastic
hoteliers and travel agents are now talking of paradise regained.
After a decade of civil war and unrest which saw tourist arrivals fall to a
miserable 185,000, the industry is on course to exceed the figure of 400,000
for the first time since violent ethnic riots left more than 1,000 dead on
the streets of Colombo in 1983.
Few would deny that Sri Lanka, with its palm trees and beaches, old colonial
hotels, delightful tea plantations and spectacular ancient Buddhist cities,
is the perfect winter destination.
Last year, 393,669 people thought just that - an extraordinary increase of
24 per cent on the previous year. The industry has now become the country's
third-largest official foreign exchange earner.
After a decade of penny-pinching, hoteliers are pulling out their cheque
books. The government has approved the construction of 35 new hotels worth
about SLRs6bn. One thousand rooms are under construction and 2,000 more are
in the pipeline.
There is still over-capacity in Colombo's five-star hotels but the days when
they courted shady Chinese gambling tycoons to set up casinos in their
establishments because occupancy was so low, seem long gone.
Sri Lanka has commissioned a tourism master plan from the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Tourist Organisation (WTO) for
the years to 2001.
Mr M. N. L. Lantra, director of research and planning at the Ceylon Tourist
Board, says the draft plan envisages total capital expenditure of about
Dollars 400m with a target of doubling tourist arrivals to about 850,000 by
the year 2001.
To achieve this, room capacity will need to double to just under 20,000 by
the turn of the century.
Foreign exchange earnings are expected to increase from just under Dollars
200m a year now to Dollars 700m by the year 2001 at 1991 prices. Direct and
indirect employment in the industry is forecast to grow from about 70,000
now to 136,000.
The plan calls on Colombo to liberalise its air transport arrangements to
attract additional foreign airlines and more charter operators.
Among many other recommendations, it urges the government to take account of
environmental concerns, such as sewage outlets, and to make a special effort
to ensure Colombo is made more attractive. Potential draws such as Galle
Face Green and Beira Lake have been allowed to wither dismally, to the
consternation of locals and foreigners alike.
There are two causes for concern on the hoteliers' horizon in spite of all
the optimism.
First, the world recession. Tourist arrivals in the first nine months of the
year were up about 1 per cent on the same period in 1992 but the past three
months have shown a worrying decline of 10 per cent.
Tourists from the UK have visited Sri Lanka in record numbers but those from
Germany, Sri Lanka's biggest market, have declined sharply, as have those
from France.
Second is the potentially lethal effect of a deterioration in the
carefully-balanced security equation.
For the past year, Tamil terrorism has largely been confined to the north of
the country, out of bounds to tourists.
The number of foreign visitors actually increased in May this year despite
the assassination in Colombo of the country's president. But a series of
incidents directly involving tourists could undermine overnight all the hard
work and investment.
