SHORT TAKES; 
$200-MILLION ART THEFT TO AIR 
The television show "America's Most Wanted" will broadcast a re-enactment of 
the theft of artworks from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, as part of the 
effort to solve the $200-million crime. 
At the urging of the FBI, museum officials allowed camera crews this week to 
recreate the March 18 crime, using actors to play the thieves and museum guards 
and enlarged photographs of the artwork made from museum slides. 
The weekly series on the FOX network re-creates unsolved crimes and provides 
telephone numbers for viewers to call in with tips. 
John Kavanaugh, the segment's producer, said the FBI, police and museum 
officials worked together to piece together details of the crime in which two 
men posed as police officers, bound two museum guards and made off with 13 
works thought to be worth more than $200 million. 
Composite drawings of both thieves will be shown during the program, 
tentatively scheduled for broadcast May 13.
