SMALL PLANES CATCH FLAK IN ORANGE COUNTY 
The near-collision over Newport Beach between a small plane and a Continental 
Airlines jet carrying 132 passengers on June 30 was Edwin C. Hall's call to 
battle. 
An air traffic controller in the tower at John Wayne Airport had told the pilot 
of the Beechcraft Bonanza to turn left after taking off. The pilot turned right 
instead, crossing within 100 feet of the Boeing 737, which had taken off just 
after the Beechcraft. Quick evasive action by the Continental pilot prevented 
what Airport Manager George Rebella describes as "my worst nightmare." 
The outspoken Hall, a former general aviation pilot who lives under the John 
Wayne flight path and who complains frequently about airport noise, quickly 
turned his neighborhood newsletter into a anti-aircraft weapon. Small planes 
are "self-serving, extravagant assault toys" that "operate over our communities 
in a life-threatening manner," he says. "Unless they reshuffle the deck out 
there, the Board of Supervisors has a responsibility to ultimately disallow all 
general-aviation-type aircraft from John Wayne Airport." 
'Accident Waiting to Happen' 
Hall is not alone in his opinion. "It's just an accident waiting to happen," 
says Carlyle H. Levinson of the Bluff Homeowners Assn. in Newport Beach in 
reference to the mix of small planes and big jets flying into and out of John 
Wayne. 
Concerns about the threat to homeowners' safety increased this week after a 
Fullerton-based single-engine Cessna 152 with an instructor and student pilot 
aboard crashed into a Buena Park residential area Wednesday, prompting that 
city's mayor to demand restrictions at Fullerton Municipal Airport. 
And only two hours after the Buena Park crash, a twin-turboprop Rockwell 
Commander on its way to John Wayne had to make an emergency landing in the 
Santa Ana River. 
Despite the fears and the criticism, however, county officials have no plans to 
ban small aircraft at John Wayne. In fact, the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors has hired the consulting firm of Kennedy/Jencks/Chilton Inc. of 
Irvine to prepare a master plan, due in April, for the continued use of general 
aviation there for at least through the next two decades. 
High Ratio of Small Planes 
John Wayne has the highest proportion -- 83.4% -- of general aviation 
operations as a percentage of the total than any major airport with the same or 
greater airline passenger volume. 
One experienced air traffic controller calls the job at John Wayne the most 
demanding he has seen, and an airline pilot says the skies over the airport 
push the limits of safety. 
Despite such concerns, aviation experts cite the lack of a "reliever" airport 
for general aviation in Orange County, the clout of private pilots and the 
airfield's colorful history as home to some of the famous early barnstormers 
and movie stunt fliers. 
Says Rebella, John Wayne Airport's manager: "Some (general aviation) people are 
a pain in the ass, but you find those everywhere. Yes, somebody is going to be 
somewhere where they're not supposed to be, and there will be a major crash. 
People are human and they make mistakes. . . . But I don't go out every day and 
say to those folks (homeowners) that it didn't happen, so they must be wrong." 
Just because there might be a crash on the freeway, Rebella adds, "you don't 
close the freeway down." 
The latest fatal air crash at John Wayne occurred in March, when five members 
of a Canadian family died in Newport Beach when their Piper Aerostar crashed 
shortly after taking off from the airport. 
"If the federal government has invested funds in a public aviation facility, by 
law that facility must be open to all types of aircraft," says James J. 
Wiggins, manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's regional planning and 
programs branch in Los Angeles. "They all help pay for the facilities. . . ." 
John Wayne Airport would lose several million dollars a year in federal funding 
if it discouraged any type of aircraft, Wiggins said, because discrimination is 
a violation of federal regulations. 
Between 1983 and 1988, the airport received $5.8 million in federal grants. In 
the 1988-89 fiscal year alone, the airport received slightly over $8 million, 
mostly because of the current airport expansion project. 
747 General Aviation Planes 
There are currently 747 general aviation planes at John Wayne, and they range 
from the smallest Cessna to the large Gulfstream corporate jets. In fact, the 
airfield is so popular with aircraft owners that there is a five-year waiting 
list for tie-down space. 
Through aircraft tie-down fees, hangar leases, wash-and-wax and fueling 
charges, general aviation accounted for $2.03 million, or 9.18% of John Wayne 
Airport's 1988 operating revenue of $22.1 million. 
"It's not a high percentage of our revenue," Rebella said. "The problem with 
general aviation is that if you allow it to run the test of the free 
marketplace, it couldn't survive at any of the major airports because the 
commercial air carriers have so much money . . . that they could basically 
price general aviation out" and buy up all the ground and hangar leases. 
"That's why the Board of Supervisors has protected general aviation," Rebella 
said. 
Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley agrees, citing a commitment the board made to 
small plane owners when plans were formulated for the $50-million passenger 
terminal now under construction. 
General aviation has declined drastically at other major airports. At Los 
Angeles International and others, the decline was because, in part, commercial 
air carriers outbid all others for leases. 
Other Factors 
But there have been other factors contributing to the decline of general 
aviation at LAX and at other airports. One is small aircraft pilots' wish to 
avoid the congestion known as "stacking," in which planes are lined up to land 
or take off. 
"The small plane driver doesn't want to get mixed in with that mess," the FAA's 
Wiggins says, "so they moved to smaller airports in the area." 
Some airports, including National in Washington, discourage private aircraft 
operators by requiring minimum 24-hour advance reservations for 
instrument-aided landings, a practice imposed by the FAA despite its 
anti-discrimination policies. 
FAA officials say such "flow control" measures are adopted only rarely, when an 
airport is completely "saturated" with air traffic and cannot handle any more. 
John Wayne Airport has never approached its theoretical capacity for takeoffs 
and landings, even though there are morning and late afternoon periods of 
severe congestion. 
Gary Proctor, a Santa Ana lawyer and county airport commissioner who keeps a 
Cessna at John Wayne, says that, because of what has happened elsewhere, he 
would like to see the new master plan for general aviation be something that 
would protect general aviation. 
"If you look at the history of major airports, the disappearance of (general 
aviation) just happens, slowly," he said. "It happens because nobody's paying 
attention, and they let it happen. It creeps up on you." 
Proctor says that the ultimate solution would be for aircraft owners to band 
together and raise the money necessary to build a small alternative airfield, 
but he quickly adds: "I'm a very small voice in the woods on that issue." 
Rebella says the safety problems are greatly exaggerated in the news media and 
that people such as Ed Hall often make irresponsible, baseless accusations. 
What's more, Rebella adds, "the FAA has been cracking down" on pilots who make 
mistakes. 
But the FAA's own figures tell a different story. So far this year, there have 
been fewer disciplinary actions taken against errant pilots than at this time 
last year, and the total number dropped to 4,212 in 1988 from 4,437 in 1987. In 
addition, the number of suspensions -- the FAA's toughest sanction -- has 
fallen to a scant 133 so far this year. The number for all of 1988 was 1,082, 
and for all of 1987 it was 1,697. 
Federal officials say they do not know the reason behind the drop. 
'Mixed Feelings' 
However, commercial pilots such as United Airlines' Dick Russell say they take 
extra precautions around John Wayne Airport because of general aviation. "The 
issue is that there is a disaster there just waiting to happen. Right now, it's 
bordering on the edge of not being safe. But we have mixed feelings on the 
issue, because many of us, like myself, are also general aviation pilots." 
Russell, a Los Angeles member of the Air Line Pilots Assn. air safety 
committee, flies in and out of John Wayne continually. Russell owns several 
small planes, but they are based at Van Nuys Airport, which does not serve 
commercial airlines. 
"The mix of small planes and airliners at John Wayne is unusual for an airport 
as busy as John Wayne, but you have to remember that it was always a general 
aviation airport. It should never have been made a commercial airport. . . . 
There isn't enough space out there to adequately handle commercial airline 
needs, so the small airplanes do get in the way. But they were there first." 
Some jetliners take off at such a steep angle, Russell said, that pilots cannot 
see small airplanes directly in front of them. Those pilots, Russell said, must 
rely on radar and air traffic controllers to protect them and their passengers. 
The FAA's Tom Rea, who was manager of the John Wayne air traffic control tower 
from April, 1988 to April, 1989, says the high number of small aircraft is "a 
major problem at John Wayne Airport because we have only two runways." 
'Tight Quarters' 
"We try to isolate the two," Rea said of general aviation and commercial craft, 
"but it's extremely tight quarters out there. The aircraft of one type must 
cross the runway of the opposing traffic. From an air traffic control point of 
view, it's one of the most demanding situations I've encountered anywhere." 
Rea, who now serves as deputy air traffic control manager at the Coast Terminal 
Radar Approach Control Center, the FAA's regional facility in El Toro, added: 
"You have many pilots in smaller aircraft who are not only student fliers but 
also low flight-time pilots. When you have an air carrier pilot with thousands 
of hours and a general aviation pilot with just a hundred hours, there's a big 
difference in experience levels. 
"That comparison meets a lot of opposition from the (general aviation) 
community. And John Wayne has one of the most cohesive general aviation 
communities I've ever seen. The problem is that Orange County is Custer's Last 
Stand for general aviation." 
Indeed, two years ago local pilots formed the Orange County Airport Assn. to 
"counter" the "growing countywide trend of hostility and intolerance toward 
general aviation," according to the membership recruitment brochure for the 
organization. 
Don Miller, vice president of the group, says the public -- and government -- 
simply misunderstand general aviation. "We are not all recreational fliers," he 
says. "We contribute to the community, and we pay our own way." 
To promote general aviation, the Orange County Airport Assn. brought John L. 
Baker, president of the 300,000-member Aircraft Owners &amp; Pilots Assn., 
which is based in Maryland, to Orange County for a major speech on June 16. 
The cries to close various airports to general aviation are "clearly a 
manifestation of the 'don't just sit there, do something -- even if it's wrong' 
syndrome," Baker told several hundred pilots at a luncheon in Irvine. "General 
aviation provides air service from over 14,000 airports in the country while 
flying five times as many hours annually as the airlines." 
Baker said general aviation provides on-demand air taxis, crop dusting, 
emergency medical and so-called mercy flights, small parcel and canceled check 
deliveries, search and rescue, aerial pipeline safety inspections and other 
services. 
The underlying problem, Aircraft Owners &amp; Pilots Assn. officials say, is 
that the number of non-private landing strips has shrunk 20% since 1969 and 
that airports such as John Wayne -- once considered a "reliever" airport for 
Los Angeles International -- now need their own "relievers." 
There isn't any place else to go that's convenient, Rebella says. Meadowlark 
Airport in Huntington Beach closed this month, eliminating 150 aircraft 
tie-down spaces. And although Fullerton has spaces available, people who live 
near it are seeking to have it shut down. 
In January, FAA officials say, a new air safety zone will be created around 
John Wayne Airport that will require general aviation pilots to be in contact 
with air traffic controllers when they are within certain altitude ranges and 
distances from the airfield. 
That action, along with the installation of collision avoidance systems by the 
airlines during the next few years, will make the skies safer, Rebella says. 
But Rebella acknowledges that these things will not, altogether, assure 100% 
safety. Someday, he said, a major mid-air collision near John Wayne Airport 
will occur, and people will be second-guessing him. 
And what will he tell homeowners such as Ed Hall? 
"I wouldn't know what to say," Rebella says. ". . .You just try to operate as 
safely as you can." 
"Nobody should have to be kicked out of any place, but this is a problem that 
people have to wake up to," Hall said Friday. 
"After all, four planes have gone down" in Southern California in "just in the 
last four days."

Number of active U.S. pilots: 694,016. Non-commercial pilot license holders 
total about 300,000, of which about 12,000 reside in Orange County. 
Number of aircraft: 222,000, all but 4,500 of which are general aviation. 
Note: General aviation includes all aircraft that are not commercial air 
carriers. Van Nuys is almost solely a general aviation facility -- the largest 
in the nation. John Wayne Airport is the fifth busiest air facility in the 
U.S., just ahead of Denver's Stapleton Airport. Chicago's O'Hare is the 
busiest, followed by Atlanta, Dallas-Ft. Worth and Los Angeles.
