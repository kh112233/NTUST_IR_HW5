  [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 21 December--A shipment of 
100 kg of ephedrine, a basic compound for processing the cocaine 
derivative known as "crack," was seized, together with 679 kg of 
marijuana. They were being transported on two trucks apparently 
loaded with tomatoes. This announcement was made here today by 
Rafael Aguilera Carrillo, the commander of the Federal Highway 
and Ports Police (PFCyP) in Ensenada. 
  He claimed that this discovery alerted federal authorities 
to 
the possible existence of laboratories specializing in the 
processing of the alkaloid, addiction to which can prove fatal 
to a person within five months. 
  Interviewed at the Tijuana airport, the police chief 
explained that the members of this force's patrol 33,403 
discovered the shipment when they responded to an automobile 
accident reported on the San Vicente-San Quintin section of the 
federal highway leading from Tijuana to Cabo San Lucas. 
  He added that they spotted the two trucks and, after 
noticing 
that the vehicles' drivers were visibly nervous, began 
inspecting them. 
  He indicated that the federal agents found the 100 kg of 
ephedrine and 679 kg of marijuana under the loads of tomatoes in 
the center of the vehicles. 
  In conclusion, he reported the arrest of Gerardo Montoya 
Villaman and Alberto David Rodriguez Leon, who were driving the 
trucks loaded with drugs to Tijuana, intending to smuggle them 
into the United States.
