 

(c) A prerequisite for label approval for meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery
systems is that it shall have been produced by an establishment under an approved plant quality control program. The
Administrator shall receive, evaluate, and approve requests for plant quality control in accordance with 318.4(d)
(1) and (2) and (e). Such a plant quality control system shall provide the controls and information necessary to assure
that the product will meet the requirements described in 301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter and will enable establishment
personnel and program employees to monitor the system for effectiveness. The system shall include a written description
of the methods used by the establishment to maintain uniformity of the raw ingredients used in manufacturing the product
and to control the handling and processing of the raw ingredients and the finished product, and shall contain provisions
for chemical analyses of the product and other procedures to determine and assure compliance with the definition
of the product. For purposes of this paragraph, a lot shall consist of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation
machinery and recovery systems, designated as such by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent, from the
product produced from a single species of livestock in no more than one continuous shift of up to 12 hours. All units
of any lot must be available for inspection by program employees. The plant quality control program shall be subject
to periodic review, and the approval of such program may be terminated in accordance with 318.4(g). 

(1) To verify the calcium content in meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems,
an analysis of a sample of at least one pound from each lot shall be performed by the operator of the establishment or
his or her agent. Individual results from the chemical analyses shall be compared to the calcium limit, prescribed
in paragraph (a) of this section, in order to demonstrate compliance. If compliance is not demonstrated, that is,
if any single analytical result is more than 0.18%,

<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 before product from a production lot that is still at the establishment or one that is subsequently produced can be
considered to be in compliance, at least three samples from that production lot shall be taken and analyzed for calcium,
either separately, or, at the option of the establishment, as a composite (i.e., combining the three samples for analysis).
The average of the results or the composite result must be less than or equal to 0.15%. Taking three samples from each
subsequently produced lot and analyzing them in order to demonstrate compliance shall continue until five consecutive
lots have mean or composite results less than or equal to 0.15%. If the statistical evidence indicates that a production
lot is not in compliance with the calcium limit, as prescribed in 301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter, the lot must
be labeled as MS(S) and meet all of the requirements for MS(S) in 319.5 of this subchapter.

The value 0.18% was derived by multiplying by 3 the expected analytical standard deviation obtained by FSIS laboratories
on the approved chemical procedure for measuring calcium which uses Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as
provided in the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International'' (formerly the Association of Official
Analytical Chemists), 15th Ed. (1990).

Individual or an average of results shall be rounded to the nearest 0.01% calcium.

(2) To verify the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score or the essential amino acid content in meat derived
from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, an analysis of a sample of at least one pound shall
be performed by the operator of the establishment or his or her agency each week during production of a lot to assure
that product will meet the requirements of 301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter. Once three consecutive results
from three production lots are in compliance with the criteria on protein quality (i.e., a protein digestibility-corrected
amino acid score of not less than 40 expressed as a percent, as reflected in paragraph (a) of this section or an essential
amino acid content of at least 33 percent of the total amino acids present, as reflected in paragraph (b) of this section),
sampling of production lots can be reduced to a monthly basis. After 6 months, sampling of production lots can be reduced
to a quarterly basis. Subsequently, if samples are out of compliance, sampling each week would be repeated until three
consecutive results from three production lots are in compliance. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid
score and the essential amino acid content shall be determined by methods given in sections 5.4.1, 7.2.1, and 8.00
in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation,''
Rome, 1990. The ``Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein Quality Evaluation'' as published by
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization is incorporated as it exists
on the date of approval. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)
and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from the Division of Nutrition, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition
(HFF260), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204. It is also available for inspection
at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. Product resulting from
the separating process which fails to meet the protein quality requirement in 301.2(rr)(2) of this subchapter,
shall be labeled as ``(Species) fat'' or ``(Species) connective tissue.''
