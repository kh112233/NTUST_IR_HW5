  [Text] Johannesburg May 9 SAPA -- The founding president of 
Tanzania, Mr Julius Nyerere, arrived at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts 
Airport on Monday [9 May] to celebrate the launch of a new, free 
South Africa. Speaking on his arrival, a smiling Mr Nyerere, 
once a crusader against colonialism and a long-time enemy of 
Pretoria, told media: "I always wanted to come to a free South 
Africa. I never believed it would come. But here it is." 
  Mr Nyerere, along with hundreds of other delegations from 
all 
over the world, will attend the presidential inauguration of Mr 
Nelson Mandela in Pretoria on Tuesday, following South Africa's 
first all-race elections. 
  Delegations from Slovakia, Georgia, Syria and Bangladesh 
have 
also just arrived. Asked if Bangladesh would be investing in 
South Africa, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A S M Rahman said his 
country had no money to invest. "But we will share our 
knowledge," he said. 
  Delegations from Iran and Rumania have also arrived, but did 
not speak at any length to the press. 
  Cuban President Fidel Castro is reportedly due to arrive at 
any moment.
