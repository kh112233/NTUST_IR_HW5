FT  07 OCT 92 / French ease Africa debt
FRANCE yesterday levelled sharp criticism at the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank when it announced a big debt relief package for
four African countries, Reuter reports from Libreville.
Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy told 14 heads of state at the Franco-African
summit in Gabon that France remained 'a militant advocate' for the troubled
continent.
'You are not alone. France is at your side,' he said, giving details of the
French initiative which officials said would help Gabon, Ivory Coast,
Cameroon and Congo. These middle-income but heavily indebted countries have
not benefited from past measures on behalf of the poorest African states.
Mr Beregovoy, standing in for convalescent President Francois Mitterrand,
said France would create a debt conversion fund of FFr4bn (Pounds 500m) by
the end of 1992.
A French official said the fund would partly be financed by debt repayments
from the four countries which would then be recycled into development
projects.
