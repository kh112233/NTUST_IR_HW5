FT  21 SEP 94 / Drivers to test system of traffic management
The final stage of an ambitious traffic-management and driver-information
scheme which could eventually cover the motorway network was unveiled at the
Channel tunnel terminal in Kent yesterday.
The Pleiades project, partly funded by the European Union, involves the
collection of weather and traffic data for transmission to variable message
signs at the roadside and to in-car receivers.
Mr John Watts, roads minister, said: 'The response to transport growth
cannot be just to build more roads. We have to make better use of the roads
we have.'
Motorways in Kent are expected to carry increased traffic when the Channel
tunnel starts its car shuttle service next month.
The project is part of a wider evaluation of traffic management systems. Its
final stage involves trials to see how drivers make use of information in
their cars. Forty drivers will test the system over the next two months.
Traffic and weather information can be transmitted to the car's radio,
interrupting the programme being transmitted. The driver can punch a
destination into a dashboard console and a small display panel coupled with
a voice synthesiser will then provide details of the quickest route,
modifying it to take account of delays.
The cost of installing this sort of display is estimated at between Pounds
1,500 and Pounds 2,000 although the equipment is not yet available in the
UK.
Pleiades has cost Pounds 8m, of which half has come from the European Union.
The British government has spent a further Pounds 5m on upgrading motorway
information systems in Kent. Private sector partners in the project are
British Telecommunications, Ford, the AA, the BBC and Wootton Jeffreys, a
consultancy.
