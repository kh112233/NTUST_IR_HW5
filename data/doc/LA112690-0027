IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
LYME DISEASE SYMPTOMS LINGER 
Some victims of Lyme disease may suffer memory loss, mood changes, tingling 
sensations, shooting pains and other signs of nerve damage that strike years 
after the initial tick bite, scientists have found. 
Antibiotic therapy can often relieve these lingering symptoms, although 
recovery is seldom complete. 
"This is similar to syphilis," said Dr. Allen C. Steere. "Although the 
neurological symptoms and consequences are different, in both diseases there 
are long periods of latent infection in the brain followed by a variety of 
neurological disorders." The doctors cautioned that only a few Lyme patients 
suffer this lingering nerve disorder, and most can be cured with antibiotics 
given early during their infections. 
Steere, who first recognized the disease in Old Lyme, Conn., about 15 years 
ago, was senior author of the latest report, written with two colleagues at New 
England Medical Center in Boston. It was published in last week's New England 
Journal of Medicine. 
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by tiny ticks that are 
usually carried by deer and mice. It is common throughout the Northeast, 
Midwest and California. 
Usually, the first sign of Lyme disease is a red circular rash around the tick 
bite. It is often accompanied by fever, fatigue, aches and other flu-like 
miseries. In more advanced stages, the disease can cause arthritis and 
neurological problems.
