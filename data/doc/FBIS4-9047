  [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia, April 16 (CTK) -- Relations 
between Slovakia and the Czech Republic should develop in a 
non-standard way given their specific nature, Slovak Premier 
Jozef Moravcik told journalists today. 
  Referring to the question of "Slovak gold", Moravcik said 
that it is being kept by the Czech Republic illegally. He 
pointed to the fact that the Czechs made the return of the gold 
conditional on Slovakia recognizing the 24 billion crown ($0.8 
billion) debt towards the Czech Republic arising from the 
division of the former Czechoslovak State Bank's asserts and 
liabilities. Moravcik said that the Slovak Government intends 
to include this issue into a big package of the as yet unsolved 
problems which it wants to discuss with Czech representatives.
