DIVORCING COUPLE FIGHT FOR EMBRYOS 
A couple in the midst of a divorce are fighting for custody of the fertilized 
eggs they put in frozen storage a few years ago. 
Junior Lewis Davis, 30, says he does not want his wife, Mary Sue Davis, 28, to 
become pregnant, and a judge has issued an order temporarily blocking her from 
having the embryos implanted. 
Despite Davis' divorce petition and his objection to becoming a father, his 
wife has said she eventually plans to have the eggs implanted, according to the 
complaint. Davis contends that he and his wife jointly own the fertilized eggs 
and that any plans to use the frozen embryos to become pregnant -- as late as 
several years from now -- have an impact on his life.
