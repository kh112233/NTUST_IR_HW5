CHILES ADMITS TO BEING TREATED FOR DEPRESSION 
Former Sen. Lawton Chiles, the latest candidate in the Democratic gubernatorial 
field, acknowledged he is being treated for depression but his opponents Friday 
shied away from making it an issue. 
Chiles, 60, readily admitted Thursday that he has been treated for the last 
year with Prozac, a costly anti-depressant drug that came onto the market in 
late 1987. 
"I wish I had known about Prozac earlier because it has helped me," said 
Chiles, who added that his condition stemmed partly from his retirement from 
the Senate in January, 1989. 
"I've had depression and sought treatment," Chiles told the Palm Beach Post. 
The Post attributed the initial report about his ailment to unidentified 
"Republican officials," but GOP officials Friday distanced themselves from the 
report. 
"I think I was depressed about what was going on in the state," joked Chiles, 
who said he takes one pill a day and feels great. "Now I'm going to do 
something about it." 
Chiles said in a telephone interview Friday that his treatment is near 
completion. "I think I'm finishing up," Chiles said. "It has really helped me. 
I really feel great." 
Spokesmen for Chiles' two Democratic opponents said that their candidates were 
healthy and that Chiles' depression was not presently an issue. 
"We're not making it an issue, certainly at this stage," said Don Pride, press 
secretary for Rep. Bill Nelson, who had been considered the Democratic 
front-runner until Chiles' entry. 
However, Pride said Chiles' decision to leave the Senate after his third term 
because the senator claimed to be "burned out" was an issue.
