MOTHER LIFTS A GLASS OF STOUT TO FREED HOSTAGE 
Freed hostage Brian Keenan had an emotional reunion Wednesday with his 
69-year-old mother, who had her first drink in 11 years to toast his release. 
Minnie Keenan was driven to Dublin from her home in Belfast to see her only 
son, who is resting and undergoing medical tests at Mater Private Hospital. 
The 39-year-old university lecturer was freed Friday after 4 1/2 years as a 
hostage in Lebanon. 
Mrs. Keenan laughed and joked with her son, who looked healthier than in recent 
days as he sat on his hospital bed surrounded by cards and flowers from 
well-wishers. 
After the two-hour reunion, during which she sipped from a glass of Guinness 
stout, she was too emotional to speak to reporters. 
"She enjoyed meeting Brian so much and even had a glass of alcohol, her first 
one in 11 years," said family friend Frank McCallam. "She has had a ball." 
There are 13 Westerners still held hostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest 
is Terry Anderson of the Associated Press. He was kidnaped March 16, 1985.
