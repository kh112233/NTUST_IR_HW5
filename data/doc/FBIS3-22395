  [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- Bhutanese Princess Dekiy 
Wangchuck [spelling of name as received], arrested last 
September for attempting to smuggle 22 rhino horns and nine bear 
gall bladders into Taiwan, was sentenced to 10 months in jail 
Friday [18 March]. 
  Wangchuck, 43, had been detained by the Taoyuan District 
Court since last Sept. 18 on charges of smuggling endangered 
species products and violating the wildlife conservation laws. 
  Although Wangchuck holds a diplomatic passport, the 
prosecutors said the case was handled according to ordinary 
criminal procedures to demonstrate the government's 
determination in cracking down on smuggling and illegal trade in 
endangered species and related products. Taiwan and Bhutan do 
not have formal diplomatic ties. 
  Police seized the 22 rhino horns, weighing 14.8 kilograms 
and 
nine bear gall bladders, reportedly worth U.S.$300,000 on the 
Taiwan market, when Wangchuck arrived at Chiang Kai-shek 
International Airport from Hong Kong Sept. 17, 1993.
