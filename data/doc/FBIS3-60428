  [Text] Kosice, east Slovakia, Dec 17 (CTK) -- The 
explosive epidemic of jaundice is the result of mass 
contamination of food, a member of the district 
anti-epidemiological unit said today. 
  The total number of patients receiving treatment for 
hepatitis A symptoms this morning was 380. 
  The range of food stuffs under suspicion is narrowing, 
epidemiologists says. The contagion is no longer thought to 
have originated from Kosice's water, dairies, bakeries, or from 
poultry, meat or fish producers. Public health officials are, 
however, examining produce sold at market. They will not yet 
name the producers under suspicion for fear of unjustly harming 
their trade. 
  In view of the rapid spread of epidemic the City Council 
closed all primary and secondary schools on December 15.
