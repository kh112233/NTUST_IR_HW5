SECORD GETS PROBATION 
Who says our justice system doesn't work? Richard V. Winrow, convicted of 
possession of 5.5 ounces of cocaine with intent to distribute, was sentenced to 
life in prison without parole ("5 1/2 Ounces of Crack Brings Life Term With No 
Parole," Part A, Dec. 7). Secord, on the other hand, operator of a tremendous 
extra-governmental scam to make millions off U.S. taxpayers and supply arms 
illegally to a murderous U.S. mercenary army, has been sentenced to two years 
probation and fined $50. 
To add further insult to this outrageous outcome, Secord is now whining that 
the independent-prosecutor law cramps his style excessively, and is launching a 
campaign to have it repealed! 
The lessons of recent history are clear: If you want to be a successful 
criminal, just be sure to commit large-scale crimes, be a white male and wear a 
suit. It also won't hurt to cultivate some contacts in the White House.
