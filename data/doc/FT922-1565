FT  22 JUN 92 / International Company News: SmithKline in Italian
co-promotion drug deal
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare and consumer group, has
signed a co-promotion deal with Sigma-Tau, the Italian private healthcare
company, to sell a drug in the US for degenerative disorders  - including
Alzheimer's disease.
Sigma-Tau already has a worldwide co-marketing agreement with Roche of
Switzerland for the drug, known as Alcar.
The three companies will promote the drug together. Alcar, which was
launched in Italy in 1986, is presently in phase III trials in the US.
Results from the US trials, involving 400 patients at 27 clinical trial
sites, are expected during the first quarter of next year. Previous trials
in Italy showed the drug could retard dementia in Alzheimer's disease,
improving attention span, long-term memory and verbal ability.
Meanwhile, SmithKline is developing two drugs, oxiracetam and denbufylline
,for the treatment of Alzheimer's.
The company said the agreement would not affect their development. It added
that the experience the group gained from marketing Alcar would help it
later when selling its own compounds.
The US Food and Drug Administration is investigating reports that some
individuals who smoked while using nicotine patches had heart attacks. It
said a hospital in Massachusetts had reported that five heart attack
patients had used nicotine patches while smoking.
