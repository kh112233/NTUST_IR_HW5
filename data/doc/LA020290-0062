TROOPS, TANKS AND PLANES SENT TO QUELL VIOLENCE IN YUGOSLAVIA 
The government on Thursday deployed troops, tanks and warplanes in Yugoslavia's 
Kosovo province, where six more ethnic Albanians were killed in fierce clashes 
verging on civil war. 
Belgrade Radio said Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek will visit Kosovo today. 
Troops roamed the Serbian-controlled province on Thursday, the official Tanjug 
news agency said, and air force jets flew low over the provincial capital, 
Pristina. 
Reporters saw 15 tanks in a village near Pristina and later saw tanks and 
trucks heading toward an army base near the capital. 
Officials said Thursday that 19 people, including a policeman, have been killed 
and 98 people hurt since ethnic Albanians took to the streets Jan. 24 to demand 
greater autonomy, free elections, the resignation of regional leaders and the 
release of political prisoners. But reporters on the scene said more than 30 
people have been killed. 
On Thursday, a teen-age girl was killed during a gunfight with police in a 
village near Podujevo, north of Pristina. Another Podujevo villager said his 
25-year-old son was shot and killed by an army officer. 
One person was killed in clashes between police and about 500 protesters in the 
village of Magura, Belgrade Radio said. Zagreb television reported three other 
deaths without giving details. 
Tanjug said the most serious clashes took place in Podujevo, Pristina and 
Djarkovica and in villages close to the town of Titova Mitvrovica, where 
thousands of Albanians gathered for the funeral of two men killed Tuesday.
