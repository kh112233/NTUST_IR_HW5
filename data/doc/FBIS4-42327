  [Text] The police believe that the authors of the attack 
this morning are "salaried" members of Commando Madrid. The 
type of attack suggests that Arizkuren Ruiz, Aguirre Lete, and 
Soledad Iparraguirre Guenechea may have been involved. 
  These same Basque Fatherland and Liberty [ETA] members are 
allegedly responsible for the death of General Dionisio Herrero 
last October. Two of them may have committed nine other attacks. 
  Defense Minister Garcia Vargas has asked the public at large 
as well as the media for help in finishing off terrorism. "We 
fear the worst, that ETA has a stable infrastructure in Madrid," 
he added.
