BLOOD SUPPLY IN MANY POORER NATIONS UNSAFE, EXPERTS SAY 
The supplies of blood available for medical transfusions in the United States, 
Canada, Australia, Japan and most of Western Europe are extremely safe, thanks 
to increasingly sophisticated screening for AIDS, hepatitis and other 
contagious diseases. 
Such screening, however, continues to be largely unavailable in Africa, China, 
the Soviet Union and much of Eastern Europe and the Middle East, resulting in 
blood supplies contaminated with disease. 
Those assessments of the world's blood supply were presented by physicians and 
health care professionals in Los Angeles on Monday at the 1990 Joint Congress 
of the International Society of Blood Transfusion and the American Assn. of 
Blood Banks. 
Experts said that while blood banks in most Western industrialized nations 
experience only periodic shortfalls in blood and blood products, many of the 
world's poorest and least developed countries continue to suffer from chronic 
shortages of blood, resulting in thousands of deaths every year. 
"Blood can never be guaranteed safe," said Dr. Gordon T. Archer of the Red 
Cross Blood Transfusion Service in Sydney, Australia, and president of the 
International Society of Blood Transfusion. "It never has been (100%) safe and 
probably never will be." 
Yet, Archer said, "in the United States . . . blood is safer today than it ever 
has been before," despite AIDS and AIDS-related viruses and other recently 
discovered communicable diseases. 
For every unit of blood transfused in the United States, there is less than a 
1% chance of becoming infected with a serious disease, said Dr. Toby L. Simon, 
executive vice president and chief operating officer of Blood Systems Inc. in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., and president of the American Assn. of Blood Banks. 
So safe is the blood supply in the United States, in fact, that two groups of 
scientists concluded in the New England Journal of Medicine this month that, 
even though it is possible to use an additional test to screen donated blood 
for the AIDS virus, it is unnecessary to do so. 
According to researchers at UC San Francisco and USC who oversaw those studies, 
the existing test for the AIDS virus in donated blood is so effective that the 
odds of developing AIDS from tainted blood in the United States now runs 
somewhere between 1 in 38,000 and 1 in 153,000, which in medical terms is 
considered a minuscule risk. 
The risks of serious infection from blood transfusions are similar in most 
other industrialized countries, but that is certainly not the case in many 
other areas of the world, said Dr. Richard J. Davey, a blood specialist at the 
National Institutes of Health who has been assigned temporarily to the World 
Health Organization in Geneva to study the world's blood supplies. 
In parts of the Middle East, Indonesia, Pakistan and India there is little or 
no screening, especially in rural areas, Davey said. As a result, in those 
countries, as well as in China, the Soviet Union and much of Eastern Europe, 
where almost no blood screening is done, the risk of contracting hepatitis and 
in some cases malaria or other contagious diseases from transfusions runs quite 
high. 
One of the most contaminated supplies of blood in the world is in Africa, 
largely because of the high incidence of AIDS in that country, Davey said. Of 
the 8 million cases of human immunodeficiency virus infection, which causes 
AIDS, more than 5 million are estimated to be in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Between 65% and 70% of the 2 million transfusions given each year in Africa 
rely on blood that has not been tested. That rate is actually somewhat better 
than it has been in the past. "It is an improvement," Davey said, but it is 
still not anywhere near what it should be. 
One of the blood-testing problems facing many countries is outdated equipment. 
In Eastern Europe, for example, blood is not collected in disposable containers 
as it is in the United States, but in glass bottles, which "haven't been used 
in the U.S. since the 1950s," Davey said. 
Another problem in screening blood for disease is the cost of running the 
tests. 
Blood screening runs between $5 and $10 per test, accounting for as much as 
half the total costs of blood transfusions. In the United States, there are now 
seven separate tests run on every unit of blood. The tests are designed to 
detect syphilis; hepatitis B; HIV, HTLV I and II (AIDS-related viruses), 
hepatitis C and and non-A and non-B hepatitis. 
Some American health advocates contend that there is a need for other tests as 
well. For example, it is thought that Lyme disease, a debilitating inflammatory 
joint disorder transmitted by ticks, might also be transmitted through blood, 
although there have been no confirmed transmissions through donated blood. 
Of particular concern to health officials in New York and Los Angeles is 
Chaqas' disease, a major cause of heart and bowel disease in Central and South 
America. The disease, named for a Brazilian physician, is caused by a parasite 
that is normally spread by the reduviid bug (also known as the assassin or 
kissing bug). But in at least two documented cases cancer patients in the 
United States have gotten the disease from transfusions, leading some health 
officials to believe it may be time to begin screening for the disease, 
particularly in parts of the country where there have been huge influxes of 
immigrants. 
Most experts, however, urge caution, saying the incidence of the disease is not 
yet large enough -- and indeed may never become large enough -- to warrant the 
imposition of a Chaqas test.
