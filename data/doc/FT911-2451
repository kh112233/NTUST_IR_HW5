FT  30 APR 91 / Survey of Singapore (8): The gloom lifts but a sense of
fragility remains - The government is signalling economic optimism; Peter
Montagnon assesses the mood and looks at trade and industry (below)
THE country's economy is proving considerably more resilient than expected
at the start of the year.
With confidence ebbing as hostilities loomed in the Gulf, the general
opinion among stockbrokers as recently as January was that Singapore could
be heading for a recession as deep and painful as that of 1985.
The government had lowered its sights to a forecast of between 3 and 6 per
cent growth in 1991, well down on the 8.3 per cent recorded last year and a
sharp break with cracking pace of the late 1980s.
Now, as early indications come in of a buoyant start, the gloom is lifting,
although there remains an acute sense of vulnerability to outside factors
and worry aboutthe impact of Singapore's pressing labour shortage.
'We haven't revisedour forecast, but we are confident that we'll make the
top end, probably a little bit more,' says Mr Lee Hsien Loong, trade and
industry minister.
Singa pore could sustain a growth rate of about 6 per cent without
overheating, he adds. Productivity is growing at about 4 per cent and it
would require an increaseof only some 2 per cent in the workforce.
Confirmation that the year gotoff to a better than expected start came in
late March with the release of trade figures for January showing a record
volume of imports and exports amounting to SDollars 20bn in that month
alone.
A particularly strong regional component tothis trade suggested that Asian
economic confidence had been less affected by the Gulf hostilities than many
assumed.
By then, however, the government had also signalled a degree of economic
sanguinity with its refusal to be panicked into reflationary action in this
year's budget.
Though Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, announced a 15.4 per cent rise to
SDollars 15.8bn for government spending in the coming fiscal year, he still
allowed for an overall surplus of SDollars 3.5bn (compared with SDollars
5.3bn an expected in 1990-91).
To the chagrin of executives he also announced a 1 percentage point increase
in employers' contributions to the mandatory Central Provident Fund,
bringing the rate to 17.5 per cent from July this year.
Admittedly the increase was partially offset by an 0.5 point reduction to
22.5 per cent in the rate paid by employees and is in linewith long-term
plans to stabilise the contributions paid by both sides at 20 per cent of
salary.
Yet the readiness to increase employers' costs suggested that the government
was not particularly worried about weakness in the local economy.
In fact inflation is, if anything, a greater concern than maintaining
economic growth. The consumer price index rose by 4 per cent in the year to
February, the highest rate recorded since 1984 and well up on the 3.4 per
centrecorded for 1990 as a whole.
'Our key problem is manpower,' says Mr Hu. In spite of the addition of a
further 60,000 people to a workforce of some 1.3m last year, labour is short
and wages are rising inexorably. A real 6.4 per cent increase in 1990, the
gain outstripped productivity growth of 3.4 per cent.
As a result unit labour costs grew and Singapore's competitive edge eroded
compared with the other newly industrialising economies in the region such
as Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea.
The decline in relative manufacturingcompetitiveness has not yet reached the
extreme which helped spark the 1985 recession, but Mr Hu says the government
will be watching the pace of wage increases particularly closely for signs
of overheating.
If this does emerge, hebelieves the most sensible response would be to take
more steps to encourage Singaporean companies to shift their low-technology,
labour intensive manufacturing activities offshore.
Such a policy is medium term in its impact and most brokers believe the
authorities' immediate reaction would be to engineer a classic Singaporean
squeeze, involving higher interest rates and a rising currency.
Three month-interbank rates were allowed to rise sharply as the economy
surged ahead in the early part of last year. They peaked at 8.1 per cent in
May before slipping back to close the year at 4.9 per cent. By late March
they were still hovering slightly below this level.
Some brokers believe that a revival of confidence following the coalition
victory in the Gulf, might prompt a return to higher money market rates with
bank best lending rates, currently averaging 7.69 per cent, rising in
tandem. Such a course would, however, require the authorities to exercise
careful management, as the economy is still widely seen as vulnerable.
By far the biggest contribution to Singapore's economic growth last year
came from the financial and business services sector. Thanks partly to a
strong stock market for the first eight months, this grew by 15 per
centcompared with 9.5 per cent for manufacturing and more modest growth in
tourism,construction and transport.
One pointer towards a further slowdown in growth this year is that the
financial sector is unlikely to repeat last year's performance.
Though the stock market has recovered from its summer slump, it is unlikely
to see a repeat of last year's record SDollars 3.5bn in new issues in 1991.
Bankers say lower stock market volume is also helping keep loan demand at
local banks relatively weak.
If that means the financial services sector cannot repeat erformance, then
manufacturing's main problem is that an 'overdependence on the US,'
according to Mr Kevin Scully, head of Research at Schroder Securities.
US direct investment in Singapore amounted to SDollars 1.1bn last year,or 42
per cent of total inflows.
A special feature in the latest 1990 Economic Survey of Singapore, published
by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, shows that the share of direct
exports by manufacturing companies going to the US doubled to 41 per cent
between 1980 and 1988.
Mr Scully says the dependency is even concentrated in one single product -
computer disk drives, Singapore's largest single export item.
The local economy thus remains highly vulnerable to developments in the US,
whose own economic outlook is still murky even though the recession there
has turned out milder than many expected.
For a ll these reasons, no one expects Singapore to return to the high
growth days ofthe late 1980s.
With a bit of luck and good management, Singapore may just manage a
soft-landing towards a sustainable growth rate of about 6 per cent, but
there is still the prospect of some pretty heavy squalls along the way.
