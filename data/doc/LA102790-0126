NEGOTIATORS AGREE ON DEFICIT-CUTTING PLAN; 
BUDGET: THE PACKAGE IS RUSHED TO HOUSE FOR A VOTE. LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES AND 
THE PRESIDENT'S AIDES BACK THE NEW MEASURE. IT FALLS $10 BILLION SHORT OF 
EARLIER $500-BILLION GOAL. 
Senate and House negotiators reached formal agreement Friday on a trimmed-down 
version of a compromise budget deficit-reduction plan and sent it to the House 
floor for approval only 10 days before the November elections. 
At a meeting in the House Speaker's office, after two full days of additional 
wrangling following months of partisan discord, congressional leaders of both 
parties and President Bush's own representatives gave their blessing to the 
package. 
The House was expected to approve the package, albeit narrowly, sometime early 
today, and the Senate would then vote on the accord later in the day. Bush 
Administration officials said there was no doubt that the President would sign 
the new measure. 
The five-year budget plan falls $10 billion short of the $500-billion 
deficit-reduction goal that the two sides had set in an earlier accord, which 
had been worked out at a 4 1/2-month-long summit between the White House and 
congressional leaders. 
Even so, it contained a sizable tax increase, designed to hit hardest at the 
rich. And it included substantial cuts in spending on agriculture and other 
government benefit programs. 
The accord came as the Treasury Department disclosed that the federal deficit 
for fiscal 1990, which ended on Sept. 30, jumped to $220.39 billion, the 
second-worst showing ever. The record -- $221.2 billion -- was reported in 
fiscal 1986. 
Economists predicted that the budget deficit for the current year, fiscal 1991, 
would soar to the $275-billion range, even with the deficit-reduction plan that 
is expected to be signed into law this weekend. 
Despite the endorsement of the plan by House and Senate negotiators Friday, 
approval by the full House early today was not a certainty. 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) predicted that the House would pass the 
legislation, but his top lieutenants reportedly were worried that 
election-conscious House Democrats might balk. Analysts figured that Democrats 
must provide 80% of the 217 votes needed for passage. 
Most Republicans in the House -- defying President Bush's support for the plan 
-- had indicated they would oppose any compromise that raises taxes. House 
Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) had promised no more than 40 to 50 
votes from GOP ranks to help pass the package. 
In the Senate, however, leaders of both parties were more confident that the 
budget plan would be approved with bipartisan backing. 
House Democratic leaders, fearing that further delay might erode support for 
the compromise agreement, rushed to bring it to the House floor late Friday 
night or in the wee hours today as one of the last acts before Congress quits 
for the year. 
Negotiators gave final approval Friday to tax increases totaling $164.6 billion 
over the next five years and tax breaks worth $27.4 billion, mainly to "working 
poor" families with incomes under $20,000 a year. 
There also would be $2.5 billion in tax relief for the oil industry. 
Overall, revenues would contribute $137.2 billion to deficit reduction, with 
spending reductions of $185 billion for the defense industry and a $100-billion 
cutback in mandatory benefit programs. 
The remainder of the $490-billion package would consist of estimated savings in 
interest payments on the debt, now amounting to $264.8 billion a year. 
Unlike most tax packages of the last decade, the plan presented to the House 
would tilt sharply against those making more than $200,000 a year through a 
combination of rate increases, limitations on deductions and a phase-out of the 
$2,050 personal exemption. 
People in this income category would see their taxes raised by an average 6.3%, 
compared to an increase of roughly 2% for those making between $20,000 and 
$200,000 a year and tax cuts of 2% or 3% for those below the $20,000 level. 
The new budget package would raise the tax rate on the highest-income brackets 
to 31%, from 28% now. It would also limit itemized deductions for wealthy 
taxpayers, reduce the benefit from personal exemptions and impose the Medicare 
payroll tax on higher incomes. 
As expected, the compromise contained a 5-cent gasoline tax increase, starting 
Dec. 1, and higher taxes on cigarettes, beer, wine, alcohol and a limited 
number of luxury goods, such as high-priced cars, boats, planes, jewelry and 
furs. 
The gasoline-tax issue is particularly sensitive in California because the 
state already has raised its gasoline tax by 5 cents a gallon, with additional 
penny-a-gallon increases scheduled each January through 1994. 
The compromise package contained few surprises, since most of its tax 
provisions were telegraphed in advance during several days of semi-public 
bargaining by negotiators. 
It did include a tax break for parents of new babies -- a tax credit of up to 
$340 for low-income taxpayers with children under 1 year old, effective Jan. 1. 
A new child health insurance credit of 6% was added for working families with 
incomes under $20,000. And the existing earned-income tax credits were more 
than doubled, with larger credits or federal payments to families depending on 
the number of children they have. 
The biggest single revenue-gainer, however, would come from applying the 
existing 1.45% health insurance tax to the first $125,000 of wages, or 
salaries, instead of using the $51,300 cutoff in effect this year. It would 
raise $26.9 billion over the next five years. 
The alternative minimum tax rate would be lifted from 21% to 24%, affecting 
relatively few high-income people who otherwise would pay no tax at all because 
they have so many legal deductions. 
In all, the changes in individual tax rates would raise more than $40 billion 
toward the deficit-cutting goal. 
In a concession to investors, the tax on capital gains was set at 28% -- a cut 
for those now in the 33% marginal rate category but merely preserving the same 
rate for the very rich, who now pay 28% on ordinary income. 
The compromise would raise airline ticket taxes to 10% from 8% and extend the 
federal telephone tax for another five years. 
In an effort to sweeten the package, the Senate-House negotiators decided to 
extend for one year a series of popular tax breaks for business, including a 
research and experimentation tax credit and a low-income housing credit. These 
provisions would lose $5.8 billion in revenue over the next half-decade. 
New taxes on insurance companies, however, would raise $8 billion. A 
controversial plan to impose Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes on 
state and local public employes who do not participate in a public employee 
retirement system was added to the package. It would yield about $9.2 billion 
in revenue.
