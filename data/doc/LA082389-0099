ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 
MAN FROM MEXICO DIES IN FIERY FREEWAY CRASH 
An unidentified man from Mexico died Tuesday after the car he was driving 
swerved off Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano and slammed into an embankment, 
bursting into flames, the California Highway Patrol reported. 
The man was driving a 1978 Pontiac Grand Prix south on the freeway near San 
Juan Creek Road at 4:10 a.m. when he apparently lost control of the car, 
striking a guardrail and an emergency call box before heading into the 
embankment, CHP spokesman Ken Daily said. 
The man was severely burned, Daily said: "He just couldn't get out." 
Authorities were trying to identify the man through the car's Mexican license 
plates, Daily said, but the vehicle recently belonged to a rental agency.
