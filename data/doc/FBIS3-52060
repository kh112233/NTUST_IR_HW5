<F P=106> [DESCO SPECIAL REPORT No. 31: "Political Violence in Peru </F>
Today," issued by Peru's Center for Development Studies and 
Promotion (DESCO)] 
  [Text] November has seen less political violence than 
almost any other time during the 13 years of war. During this 
month, there were 36 subversive actions, resulting in 42 deaths: 
six military personnel, one police officer, 11 civilians, and 18 
alleged subversives [as published]. 
  In a way, it was predictable that Shining Path [SL], 
especially, would pull back in November, after launching a 
larger number of actions for two months in a row in September 
and October. 
  This month's actions occurred primarily in Lima, which is 
still in first place with 20 attacks (56 percent). SL focused 
most of its bombings on private businesses. There were three car 
bombings during the month, two of them in commercial areas in 
Miraflores and Camacho, while the third one went off near an 
Army barracks. 
  The second-largest number of assaults took place in the 
jungle region, with eight actions (22 percent). In the province 
of Leoncio Prado, there were six clashes, two of them open 
confrontations between subversives and security forces. The 
other four battles arose out of countersubversion actions by the 
Army. And in Leoncio Prado and Huanuco, subversives carried out 
annihilation attacks against civilians. 
  The central region was in third place out of four, with five 
assaults (14 percent). Two of these actions were successive 
confrontations involving the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA) and the Army in Chanchamayo Province. The other two were 
SL bombings in Huancayo Province. 
  Last place in terms of subversive actions was taken by the 
northern region, with three assaults (8 percent). Two of the 
incidents involved the MRTA; in one they jammed the radios of 
the Chimbote National Police and in the other they rescued two 
of their members as they left the Chimbote courthouse.

  -  1. Lima 56% 
  -  2. Jungle 22% 
  -  3. Central 14% 
  -  4. Northern 
8% 

    As for the number of casualties, the central region occupied 
first place with 24 (57 percent). All were members of the MRTA, 
killed in clashes with Army troops in the province of 
Chanchamayo. 
  In second place was the jungle region, with 14 casualties 
(33 
percent). Six were Army soldiers who died in two battles with SL 
in Leoncio Prado Province. In addition, eight civilians were 
killed in SL incursions in the provinces of Huanuco and Leoncio 
Prado. 
  In third and last place were the northern and Lima regions, 
which tied at two deaths (5 percent) each. In the northern 
region, an incursion by Shining Path in the village of 
Huayllapampa in Recuay Province resulted in the death of a 
lieutenant governor and a teacher. 
  In Lima, a petty officer in the National Police was gunned 
down from a car in the Cercado district, and a woman was killed 
when an explosive device went off in a bank office in San Juan 
de Lurigancho.
