FT  09 JUL 92 / Vietnam accuses Chinese
VIETNAM has accused China of landing troops on a reef of the disputed
Spratly islands in the South China Sea and planting a territorial marker.
Vietnam's Beijing embassy confirmed reports of the landing, first published
in the official Nhan Dan newspaper, and said Vietnam had lodged a formal
protest. The protest note accused China of serious violation of Vietnamese
sovereignty and demanded the marker be removed.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to comment and there was no immediate
independent confirmation of Vietnamese claims.
The Spratly island group consists of 33 islands and 400 islets and atolls,
straddling shipping lanes in the South China Sea. Its considerable strategic
value is complemented by rich fishing grounds and deposits of oil and gas.
Besides Vietnam and China, there are four other claimants to part or all of
the disputed archipelago - the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei.
Vietnam protested loudly in May when China gave oil prospecting rights
between the Spratlys and the Vietnamese coast to a US company, fearing
Beijing was, in effect, annexing the territory.
