WORLD IN BRIEF; 
LIBERIA; 
ATMOSPHERE CORDIAL AT PEACE TALKS 
Liberian officials and rebels held their first full day of peace talks, but 
there was no sign of a breakthrough that could end the civil war that has 
killed hundreds of civilians in the West African country. A Baptist minister 
attending the talks at the U.S. Embassy in Freetown, Sierra Leone, said the 
atmosphere was cordial and that the two sides had adopted an agenda and ground 
rules. The rebels, led by Charles Taylor, have insisted that Liberian President 
Samuel K. Doe resign.
