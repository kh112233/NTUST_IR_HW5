  [Text] Bratislava, May 12 (CTK) -- The "Meciarite" 
REPUBLIKA appears today with a new name, SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, 
and a new publisher: no longer the Slovak News Agency TA SR but 
now Salus, a company in which Vladimir Meciar's party, the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), has a stake. 
  In an article entitled "Divorce After 406 days" TA SR 
director general Ivan Melichercik writes that REPUBLIKA was 
originally intended to be purely a news agency paper but owing 
to its marked political bias it became "incompatible with the 
fundamental principles of a news agency." 
  From the beginning of its existence REPUBLIKA "dragged a 
boulder of debts behind it"; this contradicted TA SR's legally 
defined status as a public corporation, which is not permitted 
any loss-making entrepreneurial activity. "TA SR's divorce from 
REPUBLIKA proceeds solely from these premises," Melichercik 
writes. 
  Jan Smolec, who remains editor-in-chief of the new 
publication, comments that "leading politicians of the 
government coalition demonstrated in March how a person can be 
hounded out of office with the aid of an intrigue," alluding to 
the unseating of Premier Vladimir Meciar by a vote of 
no-confidence. "Politicians who wanted (Slovak) independence are 
subjected to attack after attack," he writes. 
  "Intrigues, dishonour, corruption are becoming commonplace 
in 
Slovakia. Slovak independence is under threat. That's why 
there have to be newspapers which defend Slovak interests, 
honourable and incorruptible politicians," he writes. 
  Smolec concludes his article by thanking readers who have 
donated a million Slovak crowns ($30,000) thereby enabling the 
editors to continue in the same political vein as before, as the 
"only opposition daily on the media market."
