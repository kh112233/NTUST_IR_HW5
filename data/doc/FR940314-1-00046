 

II. The Proposal
 


A. Application of Existing Small Business Exemption From Nutrition Labeling Requirements 



In establishing the regulations that provide exemptions for foods labeled by small businesses, i.e., 101.9(j)(1)
for foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances
and 101.36(f)(1) for dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, FDA interpreted the 1990 amendments as
applying to food offered for sale by manufacturers, packers, and distributors. However, the Statement of Explanation
for H.R. 2900 (the bill that became the 1993 amendments) states that this interpretation was an inappropriate extension
of the law: ``[T]he statutory language provides that this exemption applies only to retailers (`person[s who] offer[]
food *** to consumers').'' (139 Congressional Record H6358 (August 6, 1993).) 

Recognizing that manufacturers, packers, and distributors may have reasonably relied on the small business exemption
provided in 101.9(j)(1), Congress, in section 2(a)(1) of the 1993 amendments, provided that the exemption
in section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act will continue to be available until May 7, 1995, in accordance with the regulation,
that is, based on gross sales made or business done to the consumer by manufacturers, packers, and distributors that
do not sell directly to the consumer. Section 2(a)(2) of the 1993 amendments further provides that after May 8, 1995,
this exemption will only be available with respect to food offered for sale by a person who makes direct sales to consumers.


FDA is proposing to modify 101.9(j)(1) and 101.36(f), consistent with the provisions of section 2(a)
of the 1993 amendments, to establish May 7, 1995, as the date after which the exemption provided in section 403(q)(5)(D)
of the act will not be available to food labeled by manufacturers, packers, and distributors but will only be available
to food offered for sale by a person who makes direct sales to consumers. The agency is revising the numbering of 101.9(j)(1)
and 101.36(f) to accommodate the proposed modifications. 



B. New Small Business Exemption From Nutrition Labeling 



The 1993 amendments added new section 403(q)(5)(E) to the act. This section provides an exemption for low-volume
food products of small businesses from the mandatory nutrition labeling requirements of section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2)
of the act. FDA is proposing to amend 101.9(j) by adding a new paragraph (j)(18) to reflect this exemption. Under
proposed 101.9(j)(18), qualification for the exemption for a low-volume food product is based on four factors:
(1) The number of units of that food product sold in the United States; (2) the average number of full-time equivalent
employees of the person claiming the exemption, e.g., the firm or corporation; (3) the absence of other nutrition
information or nutrition claims in the labeling for that food product; and (4) the timely filing with FDA of a notice
claiming the exemption. FDA is also proposing similar revisions to 101.36(f) to provide this exemption from
the requirements of section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act for low-volume food products that are dietary supplements
of vitamins or minerals. 



1. Definitions 



For the purposes of this regulation, FDA is proposing in 101.9(j)(18)(vi)(A), (j)(18)(vi)(B), and (j)(18)(vi)(C)
(and also 101.36 (f)(2)(vi)(A), (f)(2)(vi)(B), and (f)(2)(vi)(C)) to adopt, with minor changes, the definitions
for ``unit,'' ``food product,'' and ``person'' respectively, as established by the 1993 amendments in section 403(q)(5)(E)(vi)
of the act. Also, the agency is proposing a definition for the term ``average number of full-time equivalent employees''
in 101.9(j)(18)(vi)(D) and 101.36(f)(2)(vi)(D). 

a. 

Unit.

 The agency is proposing to define in 101.9(j)(18)(vi)(A) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv)(A) the term ``unit''
to mean ``the packaging or, if there is no packaging, the form in which a food product is offered for sale to the consumer.''
This definition reflects section 403(q)(5)(E)(vi)(I) of the act. Consistent with this definition, any completely
labeled package such as a can, bottle, box, or bag of a food product that is presented for sale to the consumer is a unit
of that product. Thus, for example, for soft drinks, a 12-pack or a 24-pack of 12-ounce (oz) cans that are fully labeled
would represent 12 or 24 units, respectively, of that soft drink because each can is in a form in which it can be offered
for sale to the consumer. On the other hand, in the case of a package containing six 4-oz containers of pudding, the individual
containers of which are not completely labeled (i.e., it complies with the provisions of 101.9(j)(15)), the
package of six would constitute one unit. The difference between these two examples is that in the second case, the
packaging of the product, as it is presented to the consumer, is as an individual unit of six containers (a multiunit
retail food package), whereas in the first instance, the 12-pack or 24-pack is a convenience used by the manufacturer
to deliver 12 or 24 individual units of the product to the consumer. 

The agency recognizes that there also may be occasions where a food product is sold in bulk or in individual pieces rather
than in packaging; e.g., flour may be sold from bulk containers in a grocery store. Such products are not exempt from
nutrition labeling but must have the nutrition information provided on the bulk container from which the food is dispensed
(101.9(j)(16) and 101.36(g)). Under the proposed definition for ``unit,'' a person will have to determine
the number of units of product sold in the United States not in packaging on the basis of the typical sales practice for
the food product. For example, if 2,000 pounds of flour are sold from bulk displays at grocery stores, and the typical
practice for sales to consumers is to price the flour on a per pound basis, then the bulk sales would represent 2,000
units.
