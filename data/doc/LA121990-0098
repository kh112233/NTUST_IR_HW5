BRIEFLY 
Suits Over Drug for Schizophrenics: Attorneys general from 23 states, including 
California, accused a pharmaceutical firm of price fixing and other trade 
violations in marketing a new drug for schizophrenics. In lawsuits filed in 
U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the states claim the drug, Clozaril, is 
available only if a patient also buys an expensive blood-monitoring package. 
The attorneys general sued Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. of East Hanover, N.J., 
and Caremark Inc., of Lincolnshire, Ill., which has an exclusive pact with 
Sandoz to provide the blood-monitoring package.
