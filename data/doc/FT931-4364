FT  11 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries
Tobacco stocks are the forgotten casualty of Mr Clinton's presidency. BAT
Industries has underperformed the market by 13 per cent since a new excise
duty on tobacco was proposed. Yesterday's full-year figures suggest the
market should not be too alarmed. Although BAT earns a large chunk of
profits from US tobacco, cigarette exports to eastern Europe and Asia grew
by more than 20 per cent last year. Only the most onerous of new taxes would
knock BAT's tobacco business off its stride. Besides, tobacco companies have
off-set previous falls in volume sales by widening margins under the cover
of higher taxation.
The fly in the ointment is Eagle Star's exposure to the UK housing market.
With tobacco strong and Farmers insurance expanding in the US, though, the
drag on profits is hardly noticeable. On a 30 per cent yield premium to the
market average, the shares will look cheap if Mr Clinton's bark turns out to
be worse than his bite.
