ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 
COUNCIL TO SELECT NAME FOR NEW PARK 
The Cypress City Council tonight will open secret entries and choose a name for 
a new park -- which, according to the rules, must include both a person's name 
and that of a Mediterranean tree. 
The contest sponsored by the city drew seven entries. To qualify, the entries 
must both honor a person and reflect the Mediterranean architecture of the 
area, such as Smith Palm Park. 
Other parks in Orange County have been named through contests. In fact, Yorba 
Linda just concluded a contest naming a park after the late Jean Woodard, a 
longtime community volunteer. That city still has five parks to name and is 
accepting ideas. 
But usually, parks are named after former mayors, people who donated the land 
for the park or heroes. For example, a park is named after Chris Carr, a war 
hero and longtime resident of Huntington Beach. Another Huntington Beach park 
is named after Leslie Prince, the first police officer in Huntington Beach to 
be killed in the line of duty. 
In 1971, Fullerton honored the three Apollo astronauts who died in a launching 
pad tragedy at Cape Canaveral. The city named one park for Virgil (Gus) 
Grissom, one for Richard Chaffee and a third for Edward White. 
Most cities leave the naming process up to the City Council, resulting in parks 
being named for former mayors. In fact, in Huntington Beach, names of deceased 
mayors have priority, and the name of a deceased mayor born longest ago has top 
priority. 
Sometimes the public is asked for help with more than just a name. In 1977, 
Santa Ana held a contest for a park symbol. The city received more than 350 
entries. The winner was Georgianna Russell, a clerk with an environmental 
agency. Russell had submitted a caricature of a woodpecker which read, "Welcome 
Woody." LORELEI LACHMAN
