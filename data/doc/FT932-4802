FT  08 JUN 93 / Arabs get nearer to talks
ARAB delegations edged closer yesterday to announcing their participation in
the tenth round of Middle East peace negotiations, in Washington on June 15.
But Mr Abdul-Salem al-Majali, Jordan's new prime minister, strongly denied
his country was close to signing a treaty with Israel.
Earlier, Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, had claimed the two
countries had essentially reached an accord. 'We just have to take out the
pen and sign,' he told Israel radio.
However, Mr Majali said that what was being worked on with Israel was an
agenda and the terms of reference for negotiations. 'It has substance, but
it is just an agenda, not a peace agreement', he said.
Radio reports that a peace treaty was ready to be signed were 'absolutely
and completely untrue,' he said.
A meeting of foreign ministers in Amman at the weekend had re-stated the
Arab commitment to the peace process but, at Palestinian insistence, stopped
short of formally accepting the joint US-Russian invitation to resume in
Washington on June 15.
The Palestinians are looking for firmer assurances that the US will become
more directly involved in the negotiations, and that Israel will take more
measures to ease conditions in the occupied territories.
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, was due
in Amman last night for talks on these issues with King Hussein of Jordan.
