FT  19 FEB 92 / UK opposes ivory trade resumption
Britain is pressing the EC to oppose plans at next month's meeting of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) to allow a
resumption of trade in ivory and other elephant products, writes John Hunt.
At the Cites meeting in Japan on March 2 some African states, including
South Africa and Zimbabwe, are expected to urge that the ban on ivory
trading, introduced in 1989, should be lifted. Others, such as Kenya and
Botswana, are expected to seek a resumption of trade in other elephant
products, such as skins.
The African states argue that money from the trade is needed to help
conservation of elephants and other wildlife.
