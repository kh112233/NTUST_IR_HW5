SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.



A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
 
FDA recently approved for marketing the human drug product Effexor

&reg;

 (venlafaxine hydrochloride). Effexor

&reg;

 is indicated for the treatment of depression. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received
a patent term restoration application for Effexor

&reg;

 (U.S. Patent No. 4,535,186) from American Home Products Corp., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's
assistance in determining this patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated April 22, 1994,
FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that this human drug product had undergone a regulatory review period
and that the approval of Effexor

&reg;

 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the products's regulatory review period.
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Effexor

&reg;

 is 2,959 days. Of this time, 1,981 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 978
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
1. 

The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective

: November 23, 1985. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that November 23, 1985, was the date the investigational
new drug application (IND) became effective. 2. 

The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 505(b) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:

 April 26, 1991. The applicant claims June 18, 1991, as the date the new drug application (NDA) for Effexor

&reg;

 (NDA 20151) was initially submitted. However, FDA records indicate that NDA 20151 was initailly submitted
on April 26, 1991.
3. 

The date the application was approved

: December 28, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that NDA 20151 was approved on December 28, 1993.

This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 5 years of patent term
extension. Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 31, 1994,
submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore,
any interested person may petition FDA, on or before February 27, 1995, for a determination regarding whether the
applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition
must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 4142,
1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.
Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except
that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading
of this document. Comments and petitions may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday
through Friday.
