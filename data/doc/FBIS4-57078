  [Text] Following the destruction of the Cabora Bassa 
hydroelectric plant during the war in Mozambique, Marcelo 
Siqueira, president of Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc., is 
studying the possibility of implementing a $3-million 
hydroelectric project on the Zambezi River. He said: "This is 
an opportunity for Mozambique to have, for $2 billion, its own 
hydroelectric plant that would generate 2,000 megawatts." 
  In a proposal that would result between 1 and 15 million 
tonnes of coal annually, the Rio Doce Vale Company [CVRD] is 
seeking to prospect for and transport coal through improved port 
and railway facilities. CVRD superintendent Rubem Bandeira 
said: "The $1.3 billion project would resolve the Brazilian 
requirement to import 12 million tonnes of coal." 
  Braspetro [Petrobras International Inc.] has offered to 
exploit a gas deposit and to transport the gas to South Africa, 
the main client for this item. Braspetro President Jose Barbosa 
said: "A $700-million project would be excellent if it could 
generate 40 billion cubic meters of gas." 
  The Water and Sanitation company of Brasilia has also 
offered 
its know-how concerning the supply and treatment of water and 
sewage.
