  [Text] A Russian military official has denied Western media 
allegations saying Moscow was violating the CFE [Conventional 
Forces in Europe] agreement. "Though the CFE deal became valid 
from July 17, 1992 its clause on flank restrictions, which is of 
NATO's specific concern, comes into force in 40 months' time, 
i.e. after November 16, 1995," head of the international 
department of the Russian Armed Forces' General Chief of Staff 
Georgiy Pavlodyuk told INTERFAX on Tuesday. 
  He said Russia's current strength in conventional weapons 
was 
slightly in excess of what is envisaged by the treaty and that 
"we have a further 18 months" in which to comply with CFE terms. 
  Pavolodyuk said international inspections carried out in 
Russia had confirmed that Moscow was meeting its schedule of 
conventional weapons cuts. 
  He thinks the flank restrictions were damaging to Russia's 
interests. Under the treaty, Moscow is entitled to deploy on 
its Leningrad and North Caucasian flanks only 700 tanks, 580 
APCs and 1,280 artillery pieces. 
  Pavlodyuk said the Russian president had called on other 
signatory states for a review of the flank restrictions clause 
in respect to Russia. The move follows Moscow's concern about 
national security as well as economic and social problems 
arising from troop withrawals from Eastern Europe and the Baltic 
states. "We want those restrictions to be lifted at least for 
some time before those problems have been resolved. However, 
there has been no positive response from our partners yet," 
Pavlodyuk said. 
  He made it clear that the Russian government was not wanting 
to act unilaterally. 
  The CFE agreement was signed by 28 European states as well 
as 
the United States and Canada.
