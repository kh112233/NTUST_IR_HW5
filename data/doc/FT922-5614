FT  29 MAY 92 / Tourist row flares in Ulster
TOURIST officials in Northern Ireland yesterday found they had promoted fury
as well as holidaymaking after suggesting that inquisitiveness about the
conflict between Protestants and Roman Catholics could be a selling point
for the province.
The listing by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board of the 'curiosity factor'
as an important strength was condemned by politicians and business - even if
it was only acknowledging an unspoken truth: that most tourists have
previously seen Northern Ireland only in grisly news pictures.
Tourist board officials hurriedly made clear that its three-year corporate
plan did not propose the marketing of bus tours to terrorist-hit areas of
west Belfast, or listing bed and breakfast accommodation along the 'peace
line'. The emphasis would be on increasing understanding about the
'troubles', they said. The corporate plan says many visitors 'may be
motivated to visit simply to see why there should be such conflict in modern
society'.
Mr William Hastings, chief executive of the Hastings hotel group, said the
board was mistaken. 'The conflict still exists. Were it over, then some
places, like the walls which divide the Shankill and the Falls may be of
some interest. But I think we have many other things of much greater
interest to offer the tourist,' he said.
Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP, said: 'You don't help the tourist
industry by drawing attention to the troubles.'
The Northern Ireland Office is keen to promote tourism, believing there is
scope for growth - some 263,000 holidaymakers are estimated to have visited
last year. But until now explicit mention of conflict has been shunned in
favour of Northern Ireland's scenic beauty.
