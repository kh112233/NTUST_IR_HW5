GOING 'ROUND AND 'ROUND ON CHOPPERS; 
POLICE PRAISE THEM BUT COPTER POOLS HAVEN'T CAUGHT ON 
When a Costa Mesa police helicopter whirs over the city by day, it is called 
Eagle I. When it takes to the skies at night, its moniker becomes Eagle III. 
Until two years ago, the night shift copter was known as Eagle II. But that 
name conjures up bitter memories for the crew members who fly the machines in 
Orange County. The name Eagle II was retired in memory of the three men who 
died when a Costa Mesa police helicopter collided in the air with a Newport 
Beach police chopper in March, 1987. 
Although the name change provides a ready reminder of the hazards of police 
helicopter work, police departments in the county have been undaunted in 
pressing forward to start or expand aerial patrols: 
* Santa Ana increased the helicopter coverage it receives on a contract basis 
from Costa Mesa Police as of last Sunday. Instead of flying three times a week, 
the patrols, formerly made three times a week, are now made nightly. Duty is 
rotated among three Santa Ana officers to accompany the Costa Mesa police 
pilots as observers. 
* The Brea Police Department has for the last three months been studying the 
feasibility of starting its own helicopter patrol. 
* Some police departments are planning to beef up or modernize their helicopter 
fleets. Costa Mesa plans to add another four-seat helicopter with some of the 
money it receives from its contract with Santa Ana. Newport Beach police plan 
to replace an older copter with money realized from the sale of assets seized 
from drug dealers. And Huntington Beach -- which 20 years ago was the first 
Orange County police agency with helicopter service -- ordered two new advanced 
helicopters that will be available in two years. 
12 Available 
All told, there are 12 police helicopters available for duty among five law 
enforcement agencies in Orange County. All but two -- the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department copters known as Duke I and Duke II -- are used in cities 
in the northern section of the county. There have been years of talk about the 
advantages of creating helicopter pools for routine patrols, but a Huntington 
Beach police captain who has studied the issue said such an arrangement appears 
years away because of questions about how it would be implemented. 
Santa Ana, however, has taken the first step. The contract by which Costa Mesa 
will receive as much as $200,000 a year allows Santa Ana to have police 
helicopter patrols that use its own officers as observers -- at a fraction of 
what it would cost to buy helicopters and train its own crew. (Newport Beach, 
for example, spends $490,000 a year on its helicopters, and that figure does 
not take into account the crew members' salaries.) New turbine-powered machines 
can cost up to $700,000, police helicopter officials said, and, of course, the 
maintenance, fuel and associated training would be extra. 
Santa Ana Police Chief Paul Walters said the agreement with Costa Mesa proved 
successful during a yearlong test of patrols on Friday, Saturday and Sunday 
nights. 
"We tried it on a test basis for three days a week," Walters said. "We 
evaluated it closely and found it very beneficial." 
Costa Mesa Sgt. Bill Bechtel, who helps supervise his department's helicopter 
operations, said the the money will be applied to the purchase of another 
McDonnell Douglas 500E, the black-and-white sedan of the skies. Having another 
copter will help reduce "down" time because of maintenance, he said, and it 
could also mean that two helicopters could be in the air at once serving both 
Costa Mesa and Santa Ana. 
Adding to the patrol area will not affect response time significantly, Bechtel 
added, contending that the copters would still be able to get to just about any 
spot in five minutes or less. 
In what also could become a law-enforcement trend, Newport Beach is planning to 
pay the $600,000 price for a new helicopter with funds obtained from the sale 
of assets seized from drug dealers, Newport Beach Officer Bob Oakley said. 
Officials in local police departments say the machines have proved their worth 
time and again and that new uses for them are being found all the time. 
Bechtel said the Costa Mesa one answers more than 400 radio calls for 
assistance a month and was directly responsible for 174 arrests made in the 
12-month period ended July 31. (Figures for drunk drivers are not included in 
this tally.) 
Huntington Beach police say their copters are especially useful in spotting 
traffic violations. Should an officer in a helicopter suspect that a particular 
motorist has run a red light, for example, he can direct an officer in a patrol 
car below to stop the vehicle. 
700 Tickets a Year 
"We write 700 tickets a year," boasted Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Jeff King. 
Helicopter officials shy away, however, from drawing direct comparisons to the 
productivity of helicopter versus ground units. "It's kind of hard to compare 
the effect of something that can't do comparable functions," Oakley of Newport 
Beach said. 
For instance, finding people hiding at night is something police helicopters 
are specially equipped for -- there are the spotlights and the infrared scopes 
in the cockpit. The infrared is especially helpful; with it, officers can tell 
which cars in a parking lot were driven most recently because the device can 
detect heat from the engines. 
The infrared equipment's abilities have even astonished other officers, Bechtel 
said. In one recent case, he said, he was directing ground officers to an auto 
theft suspect whom they thought was lying in a field that had been thoroughly 
searched, eluding even the noses of police dogs. 
On the infrared scope, however, the suspect "glowed like a light bulb" on the 
monitoring screen. The officers on the ground were incredulous, though, until 
the helicopter beamed its light on the suspect. That, Bechtel said, sent the 
suspect scampering off into a nearby auto mall; the officers chased him and 
eventually were able to arrest him. 
A Few Complaints 
Helicopter officials said the noise from low-flying police helicopters 
sometimes brings complaints from residents, but King said people usually are 
more understanding when they are told why the helicopter was there. 
Some of the police agencies have taken steps to control noise. Shortly after 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department began using them, the copters' tail 
rotors were replaced with quieter blades, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
Despite their usefulness, agencies have hesitated to pool their helicopter 
patrols because of financial and logistical concerns. Although the five 
agencies routinely answer emergency calls from neighboring police departments 
that do not have helicopters, Santa Ana is the only department to pay for the 
use of another city's whirlybird. 
Huntington Beach bases its copter on Gothard Street in a rural area, but each 
of the other agencies operates out of John Wayne Airport. 
Huntington Beach Capt. Merle Schneblin, who recently completed a report on the 
pooling issue as part of a management study course, said that agencies refuse 
to come to terms with the idea of consolidating resources. 
Mixed Response 
Schneblin said he found "a lot of feelings for it, a lot of feelings against 
it" when he recently brought police officials together to discuss the issue. He 
predicted that officials will not seriously consider it, however, until a 
serious budget crunch or a disaster proves the wisdom of having areawide copter 
patrols. 
"It's probably going to take some catastrophe . . . to force the issue," he 
said. 
Westminster Police Chief Jim Cook said that his department might be interested 
in a joint helicopter agency but that it has no plans to start its own service. 
"They are very expensive. . . . I think they are very good programs, but they 
are not on our list of priorities in the future," Cook said. 
And Fullerton Police Capt. Richard Kvancz said that his department has 
informally been discussing the possibility of adding a helicopter for years, 
even joining in a joint agency of cities in the area. But he also expressed 
concern about the expense. "It's very expensive, not only the initial costs but 
the maintenance and additional training."
