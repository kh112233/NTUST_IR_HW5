3 DIE, 150 HURT AS TRAIN HITS FIRE TRUCK 
An Amtrak train smashed into a fire truck at a railroad crossing Thursday night 
and derailed, killing three people and injuring more than 150 passengers. At 
least two of the dead were in the fire truck. 
Both engines and 11 cars of the southbound Crescent, bound from New York to 
Atlanta and New Orleans, derailed when the collision occurred about 7:40 p.m. 
in this northern Virginia town about 40 miles southwest of Washington, D.C., 
said Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen in Washington. 
The train was carrying 379 passengers and a crew of 20, he said. Five cars of 
the 16-car train remained on the track, said Pat Jeffrey, another Amtrak 
spokesman. 
Two on Truck Die 
Two of the dead were on the fire truck, which was responding to a call from the 
nearby town of Catlett when the accident occurred, said Sgt. Butler Grant of 
the Fauquier County Sheriff's Department. It was not immediately known whether 
the third fatality was also a firefighter. 
Fauquier Sheriff's Deputy R. R. Crawford said 150 or more people on the train 
were injured. They were transported to nearby Prince William Hospital in Prince 
William County and Fauquier Hospital in Warrenton. 
Dr. Thomas Ryan of Prince William Hospital said the hospital had treated about 
26 people, "most minor." Steve Givens, a Prince William spokesman, said three 
were in serious condition and the hospital expected a total of 34 injured.
