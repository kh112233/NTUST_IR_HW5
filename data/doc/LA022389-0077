MORNING REPORT: ART 
An international art dealer suspected in the theft of millions of dollars worth 
of oil paintings was found dead in his London, Ontario, apartment in an 
apparent murder-suicide, Canadian police said Tuesday. Superintendent Don 
Andrews told the Associated Press that the bodies of Peter Nixon, 58, and his 
wife Evelyn, 55, were found Monday in the bedroom of their apartment and were 
believed to have been dead about a week. A handgun was also found. Andrews said 
Peter Nixon was at the center of an international investigation into the theft 
of 20 oil paintings stolen from two British homes -- one in England and one in 
Scotland -- in 1981 and 1982. He said both the Canadian and British police, as 
well as the FBI, had been involved in the investigation. Twelve of the 20 
paintings, some of which date back several centuries and are valued at more 
than $10 million, have been recovered in Europe, the United States and 
Canada.Shauna Snow
