<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif </F>
by Zaki Shihab in Tehran; date not given] 
  [Text] [Shihab] How do you assess the state of 
Iranian-Iraqi relations in light of recent bilateral contacts? 
  [Zarif] It is a matter of policy for us in Iran to cultivate 
good relations with all our neighbors, particularly those with 
which we share borders. This holds for Iraq and the other Arab 
states, as well as the republics of the former Soviet Union and 
Turkey. 
  Our intention is to sort out all our problems with Iraq. To 
that end, we initiated confidence-building measures, 
particularly after the end of the war Iraq triggered. Recent 
moves to improve our ties with Iraq began in Karachi, where our 
foreign ministers met. There was another session in New York. 
The two sides agreed to follow up with exchange visits on 
various occasions with a view to ironing out outstanding issues. 
  My visit to Baghdad was to lay the groundwork for this and 
to 
ensure the success of any future talks between the Iraqi and 
Iranian foreign ministers. After my visit to Baghdad, a top 
Iraqi Foreign Ministry official came here. 
  [Shihab] What did you talk about at these sessions? 
  [Zarif] The prisoners of war, disputed border demarcation, 
and coordination on reactivating the Shatt al-'Arab, plus other 
technical matters. The Iraqis raised the question of their 
aircraft that landed on our territory in the wake of the 
invasion of Kuwait. For our part, we brought up the issue of the 
Iranian planes that landed in Iraq, that were either hijacked or 
whose pilots defected. 
  [Shihab] How many Iranian are held by Iraq? 
  [Zarif] Twenty, the last plane was commandeered to Baghdad 
about two months ago. It is still being held there in 
contravention of international aviation rules that require Iraq 
to return it and hand over the hijackers. As for the Iraqi 
planes that landed on our territory against our will, we think 
that as long as the international embargo remains in place, we 
should keep them, as stipulated by UN Security Council and UN 
resolutions. 
  [Shihab] Is your call for a restoration of ties with Iraq 
tactical, or is it based on strategic considerations? 
  [Zarif] We view our relations with Iraq from a strategic 
perspective, based on a desire on our part to nurture good and 
cooperative relations with all our neighbors. It is in this 
frame of mind that we have sought to bury the hatchet. In other 
words, we have been trying to rise above the wounds of the war 
that exhausted our manpower and economic resources. We have 
worked and are still working on starting with a clean slate. We 
are reaching out to our neighbors in the south of the Gulf in 
the interest of regional stability and to forestall attempts by 
external powers to destabilize the region in order to justify 
their continued presence. Let me repeat that we are now 
approaching Iraq from a strategic perspective. Naturally, 
pressing issues still need to be addressed. For instance, the 
prisoners of war [POW's]. We still think Iraq holds a large 
number. 
  [Shihab] Can you be specific about the number? 
  [Zarif] The trouble is that the Iraqi Government has been 
asserting for some time that it has none. This is at odds with 
our estimates. We have documents to show that there are 8,000 
Iranian prisoners in Iraq. We have provided the International 
Committe of the Red Cross [ICRC] with information about 3,700 
prisoners. We also know there are Iranian prisoners in two 
Iraqi camps to which the ICRC has been denied access. According 
to our records, there are 39,000 Iranian prisoners in Iraq, of 
whom only 18,000 are registered with the ICRC. The ICRC knows 
nothing about the rest. Some of these have been in detention for 
more than five years. The question of prisoners of war is a 
humanitarian one and so needs urgent attention. We have been 
asking our Iraqi brothers to do something positive about this 
issue so the POW's dossier can be closed. 
  [Shihab] What was Iraq's reply? 
  [Zarif] The Iraqis said they had been pressed to raise the 
issue of the Iraqi POW's in Iran and that they had no interest 
in keeping any Iranian POW. They said: We want to clarify the 
matter and clear the air. There are many other issues on which 
we should cooperate so we can succeed in building and enhancing 
confidence between the two sides, on both the official and 
popular levels. 
  [Shihab] Do you have the impression that Iraq's replies are 
true and sincere? 
  [Zarif] It is difficult to comment on that. However, I hope 
the Iraqis are sincere. We in Iran and Iraq will remain 
neighbors forever, whether we like it or not. This is one of 
life's realities. 
  [Shihab] Have you sensed any Iraqi effort to resolve the 
problem of the POW's? 
  [Zarif] We have not yet received any signs of such 
readiness. 
We made proposals at the negotiating table. They also explained 
their views on several issues. 
  [Shihab] Did they deny the presence of Iranian POW's in 
Iraq? 
  [Zarif] Yes, they did. 
  [Shihab] Do you have any evidence supporting your claims of 
the presence of such POW's? 
  [Zarif] We have no evidence, but we strongly feel a large 
number of Iranian POW's are still detained in camps. We are 
making every effort to apply UN resolutions regarding relations 
between the two countries. Iran has previously complied with 
these laws, and it will continue to do so in the future. 
  [Shihab] Regarding the aircraft issue, the Iraqi Government 
is talking about 100 aircraft, while you are talking only about 
20 or 30 Iraqi aircraft in Iran. 
  [Zarif] The problem is that the Iraqis believe all the 
aircraft that left Iraq headed for Iranian territory. This is 
wrong. Some Iraqi aircraft that took off crashed and some 
others returned to Iraq. Iraq believes every aircraft seen on 
radar heading for our territory and our airspace is in Iran. 
This is untrue. We are honest in seeking a solution to this 
problem. Iran has about 20 aircraft in Iraq. Some of them 
were, as I said, hijacked. Regrettably, the hijackers were not 
tried or extradited and the aircraft were not returned. 
  [Shihab] How many Iraqi aircraft crashed in Iranian 
territory? 
  [Zarif] I don't have a specific figure in mind. Here, I 
would like to add that some of the aircraft that landed in our 
airports were Kuwaiti aircraft Iraq seized after its invasion of 
Kuwait. We carried out maintenance work and returned them to 
their original owners. 
  [Shihab] How many? 
  [Zarif] About six, and we still expect the Kuwaiti 
Government 
to pay the costs of their maintenance in Iran. 
  [Shihab] How may Iraqi aircraft are at your airports? 
  [Zarif] We had announced the arrival of 22 aircraft, 
including the six Kuwaiti aircraft that were returned. 
  [Shihab] What are your conditions for returning the Iraqi 
aircraft? 
  [Zarif] The international embargo imposed on Iraq does not 
allow their return. When the embargo is lifted, we will discuss 
and resolve the issue within the general framework of the 
Iraqi-Iranian relationship. Our aircraft are still held in 
Iraq, and we have to resolve that problem. 
  [Shihab] To what extent do you agree with the Iraqi 
Government confrontation of the establishment of a Kurdish 
state, especially since you have previously said you reject the 
establishment of a new Israel on your border? 
  [Zarif] We clarified our position on the need to maintain 
Iraq's territorial integrity from the beginning, after we felt 
that some had ambitions in the region. This was not a 
unilateral Iranian position. Syria and Turkey shared with us 
the idea during the periodic meetings we held. We agree with 
many Arab and foreign countries that Iraq should remain unified. 
We reject the partition of Iraq. Any attempt to partition it 
will create problems and dangers that will threaten a number of 
the region's countries. From the very beginning, we opposed 
Iraq's invasion of the State of Kuwait. We will take a similar 
position in the future. On the international level, we also had 
a similar position on Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. We also 
urged some Gulf Cooperation Council member states to solve their 
border disputes through understanding, because we believe 
dialogue is the best means for understanding. 
  [Shihab] You are talking about an understanding with 
Turkey about the issue of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq. But 
Turkey has often charged that Iran is extending military aid to 
banned Kurdish groups in Turkey. 
  [Zarif] I have seen such reports, but Turkey and Iran have a 
complete understanding about the situation in Iraq and the 
violability of its territorial integrity. We have also reached 
an understanding on combating terrorism from whatever source it 
comes. We look forward to the day when Iraq complies with all UN 
resolutions and reasserts its authority on all its territory. 
Syria also shares this hope. 
  [Shihab] Are you worried by the cooperation between the 
Kurds and certain Western nations? 
  [Zarif] Human rights in Iraqi Kurdistan is not a new issue. 
What is new, however, is the newfound Western and American 
interest in the matter. Then, you have the Israeli presence in 
northern Iraq on which we must keep a watchful eye. 
  [Shihab] What evidence do you have of Israeli-Kurdish 
cooperation close to the border with Iran? 
  [Zarif] We have heard much about this presence and this 
cooperation. 
  [Shihab] Have you received reports about the matter? 
  [Zarif] We have received reports. We are following them 
closely. There are indications that there have been visits and 
contacts that have nothing to do with humanitarian and social 
work. They are purely political and suggest ill intentions. 
  [Shihab] One of the issues that will come up during the 
forthcoming visit to Baghdad by 'Ali Akbar Velayati is the 
future of Iranian and Iraqi opposition groups -- Mojahedin-e 
Khalq and the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution of Iraq 
[SAIRI]. Have you reached an understanding with Iraq on the 
activities of the two organizations? 
  [Zarif] From the start of the war imposed upon us by Iraq, 
mercenaries have been working on behalf of the Iraqi Government. 
They have mounted numerous terrorist attacks for the enemy. We 
are not worried about the presence of such hypocrites on Iraqi 
territory. However, if Iraq really does want to turn a new leaf 
in its relations with Iran, we will certainly pursue our 
security and our people's safety. Thus, if any terrorist groups 
mount an offensive action on our territory, we will have to 
pursue them across the border into Iraq where they maintain 
bases. Cooperation between the two countries is hardly advanced 
by giving refuge to such people. They have to be barred from 
pursuing any activities that will damage relations between Iraq 
and Iran. 
  [Shihab] How did the Iraqis react to your proposals 
regarding Mojahedin-e Khalq and SAIRI, led by Muhammad Baqir 
al-Hakim? 
  [Zarif] The human rights issue in Iraq must be addressed. 
We think the reasons that prompted hundreds of thousands of 
Iraqis to cross into Iranian territory must also be addressed. 
We are playing host to them on humanitarian grounds. There is 
no comparison between the presence of SAIRI in Iran and that of 
Mojahedin-e Khalq in Iraq. 
  [Shihab] Are we likely to see Iranian pilgrims visiting 
al-Najaf and Karbala' anytime soon? 
  [Zarif] This is one of the issues that we discussed with the 
Iraqis. We want to see movement of people in both directions 
for visits to holy sites. We are striving to work out an 
arrangement. 
  [Shihab] When do you expect a solution on that front? 
  [Zarif] We have been cooperative. The ball is now in the 
Iraqi court. 
  [Shihab] When will Dr. Velayati visit Baghdad? 
  [Zarif] Within the next two months. There are a number of 
outstanding issues we hope will be straightened out through 
diplomatic channels before a date is set for the visit.
