  [Text] Vilshofen (DPA) -- At the political Ash Wednesday 
event of the Bavarian Social Democrats, the Social Democratic 
Party of Germany [SPD] began the election campaign with attacks 
against the Federal Government and the Christian Social Union 
[CSU]. 
  The mood in the SPD is good at the moment, "but this must 
now 
be turned into votes," SPD candidate for the chancellor's office 
Rudolf Scharping said, speaking to an audience of more than 
1,000 people at the traditional SPD meeting in Vilshofen, Lower 
Bavaria. In the overcrowded meeting hall, Bavarian SPD 
Chairwoman Renate Schmidt called for bringing about a change in 
the government: "It is time for a change." 
  Scharping accused the Federal Government of damaging 
Germany's "greatest asset," the stability of social peace, the 
quality of work, and internal security. A change must finally 
be brought about in Bonn: Even though the SPD has already won 
in many polls, it must now also win the elections: "Helmut Kohl 
as a retiree in Oggersheim -- this is a nice prospect for Kohl 
and a useful one for Germany," Scharping said. 
  In his view, the CSU "deserves a rest after its many 
affairs." It is so busy with mastering its affairs that it is no 
longer contributing toward mastering the problems in Germany. 
Bavaria also deserves a "good female minister president." 
  Renate Schmidt criticized the Bavarian government party by 
saying that the "Republikanization of the CSU" is increasing. 
Anyone who makes a policy with the "fear of having too many 
foreigners" must not be surprised that right-wing extremists are 
on the rise.
