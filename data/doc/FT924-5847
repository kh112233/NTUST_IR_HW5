FT  25 NOV 92 / Firebombs and the ballot box: Germany
SYMPATHY for right-wing extremism appears to be increasing in Germany and
more Germans are hostile to foreigners, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
Attempts to explain the trend have become entangled with the debate about
amending the constitutional right to asylum, the influx of refugees, and the
government's slow response to rising violence.
At the last general election, in December 1990, the only extreme right-wing
party to campaign was the Republicans, which gained 2.1 per cent of the vote
but no parliamentary seats. This was well below its 7.2 per cent of the vote
in European elections in 1989. The party won 10.9 per cent in
Baden-Wurttemberg's state election last April.
The other significant right-wing movement, the Deutsche Volksunion won state
representation in Bremen last year, with 6.2 per cent and in
Schleswig-Holstein this year with 6.3 per cent.
Neither party has made a real breakthrough in eastern Germany, although more
neo-Nazi groups have been gathering support, especially among unemployed
youths.
Attacks on foreigners are rising: in the first half of this year, 1,443
criminal acts against foreigners were registered, compared with 2,427 for
the whole of last year and 246 in 1990.
This year, 11 people have died in apparently racially motivated attacks.
More than 30 per cent of the registered crimes were arson and bomb attacks.
Most were committed in the wealthy western Lander of North Rhine-Westphalia,
Hesse and Baden-Wurttemberg.
In September, 99 racist attacks were reported on hostels for asylum seekers,
refugee homes, individuals and property. These included firebombings,
attacks with iron chains and pipes, the desecration of Holocaust memorials,
the smashing of windows of Turkish houses, and petrol bombs being thrown
into hostels.
