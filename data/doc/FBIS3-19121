  [Text] The IRA tonight accused police of gambling with 
peoples' lives over the Heathrow airport mortar bomb attacks. 
The Provisionals claimed their warnings of attacks were 
deliberately ignored. 
  In a statement, the terrorists said: "The luck of the 
British 
authorities who are deliberately taking these calculated and 
cynical gambles with peoples' lives will inevitably run out. 
Our coded warnings should be heeded." 
  The IRA claimed the authorities failed to "act 
appropriately" 
when they were given what it described as accurate advance 
warning of the attack on the north runway on Wednesday [9 March]. 
  The Provisionals accused Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
Paul Conlon and anti-terrorist squad head David Tucker of 
"arrogant boasting" and claimed a six-hour warning of the attack 
at terminal four had been totally ignored.
