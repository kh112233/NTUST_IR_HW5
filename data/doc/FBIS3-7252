  [Text] Yala -- Paramilitary troopers and police yesterday 
evening clashed with separatist bandits of the Barisan Revolusi 
National at a mountain range in Ban Talowe in Yaha District. 
  The fighting erupted at about the time Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai arrived for an inspection tour of this southern province. 
  No Thai officers were wounded in the 20-minute clash while 
some members of the separatist group, led by Ma Su-ngai Batu, 
were believed to have been hit by gunfire. 
  In downtown Yala, security has been stepped up in areas 
surrounding the Yala Rama Hotel where Mr. Chuan is staying. 
  About 100 cadets of the Ninth Regional Police Academy were 
deployed every 50 meters around the hotel while a van of the 
Interior Ministry which can monitor mobile telephone signals was 
parked in front of the hotel. 
  Police dogs were used to sniff for bombs at the residence of 
the Yala Governor where the Prime Minister is scheduled to meet 
with Muslim leaders of the province.
