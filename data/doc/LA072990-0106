GAYS WANT WALESA STREET RENAMED 
Members of the gay community are urging city leaders to rename the downtown 
Civic Center's Lech Walesa Street because of an anti-homosexual statement the 
Polish Solidarity leader allegedly made this spring. Walesa, who won the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 1982, is accused of telling delegates to an April Solidarity 
union convention that he would "eliminate" homosexuals from Polish society if 
he were elected president. 
The alleged remarks caused an uproar in the city's gay community which recently 
persuaded Supervisor Harry Britt, who is gay, to schedule a hearing on the 
renaming proposal. Britt has contacted the Polish Embassy in an effort to get a 
copy of the text of Walesa's speech. The issue will be discussed Aug. 7 by the 
board's City Service Committee. Ivy Street was renamed Lech Walesa Street in 
1986 in honor of the Polish union leader's battle for democracy.
