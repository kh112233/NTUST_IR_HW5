COUPLE HURT WHEN TRAIN HITS CAR THAT WAS THRUST ONTO TRACKS 
An Anaheim couple were injured Saturday when a train hit their car, which had 
been rear-ended by another vehicle and thrust into a Fullerton railroad 
crossing, authorities said. 
Laura and Javier Nunez, both 28, were in the car when the train hit it but 
sustained only minor injuries, according to Fullerton Police Sgt. Bud Lathrop. 
They were taken to Martin Luther Hospital Medical Center in Anaheim and were in 
stable condition, a nursing supervisor said. 
The incident occurred about 6:25 p.m. at a Santa Fe Railroad crossing on State 
College Boulevard just north of Orangethorpe Avenue. 
The driver who rear-ended the couple was described as an Anaheim man in his 
30s. He apparently was uninjured. Lathrop said the incident was originally 
being investigated as a hit-and-run because the driver left the scene. 
Authorities later learned that he had left his identification with another 
passer-by. Lathrop said investigators are uncertain why the man left the area 
and said they will question him about the incident. 
"The driver was still at the scene after the train hit the car," Lathrop said. 
"When officers arrived, they told the driver to stay put while they assisted 
the victims. When they got back, he was gone. We now think his fleeing was not 
an attempt to get away as such. He apparently got bored. We still want to talk 
to him, though. " 
Lathrop said the driver may be cited for driving without a license.
