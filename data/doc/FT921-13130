FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Fisons restores presentation to City
FISONS, the pharmaceuticals group, yesterday began the process of rebuilding
bridges with City institutions when it gave its first research and
development presentation in four years.
In a speech to analysts, Mr Patrick Egan, executive chairman, denied that
the company was leaderless following the surprise resignation of Mr John
Kerridge as chairman and chief executive.
Mr Egan said he would remain involved in every aspect of the business until
a new chief executive was appointed. Thereafter, he would concentrate his
energies on the company's strategic direction and improving relations with
shareholders and the City.
An inspection by US Food and Drug Administration officials of the company's
manufacturing facilities for Opticrom and Imferon was expected shortly.
Analysts said the sites should be ready for inspection by mid-March.
However, Mr Egan refused to give a date when the two products would be
re-introduced to the US market. They were withdrawn last year from the US
following violations of FDA regulations. Fisons was forced to make a Pounds
65m provision following the ban.
Mr Peter Fothergill, research and development director, gave a presentation
on the prospects for Tipredane, a steroid asthma treatment, and Remacemide,
a potential treatment for epilepsy and stroke.
Analysts said they were impressed by the commitment of Mr Egan, but pointed
out that the two new drugs were unlikely to be on the market for at least
six years.
'This presentation was really two years too early,' said Mr Jonathan de
Pass, a pharmaceuticals analyst at BZW. 'Given the products may not be
available for some years, there seems to be a lot of wishful thinking.
Developing drugs is a risky business.'
