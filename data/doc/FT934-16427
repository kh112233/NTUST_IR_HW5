FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: CarnaudMetalbox plans unit sale
CARNAUDMETALBOX, the Anglo-French packaging group, plans to sell its
high-performance plastics division to Huhtamaki, the Finnish consumer
products group.
The sale, which is subject to the signing of an agreement by the middle of
this month, comprises all CarnaudMetalbox's activities in the division,
which supplies rigid plastic packaging for the food industry. The division
has factories in France, Northern Ireland, Italy and Portugal. It employs
about 750 people and achieved sales last year of FFr650m (Dollars 112m).
CarnaudMetalbox would not disclose the value of the disposal or the profits
of the division.
Anglo-French group said it was selling the division because it represented
only about 7 per cent of the European market for rigid plastic packaging and
conditions required a stronger presence.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, chief executive, said the sale would allow CarnaudMetalbox
to focus on its main strategic activities where it has technological and
marketing leadership.
