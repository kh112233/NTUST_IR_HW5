<F P=106> [Report by Rauf Gerz: "Dogs Found 12 Kg of Heroin"] </F>
  [Text] Some 12.345 kg of heroin were discovered on Dutchman 
Johannes Dijkstra at the Ataturk Airport in Istanbul. The drug 
trafficker reportedly revealed that he charged the dispatchers 
of the heroin double the amount usually paid to couriers because 
the airport police have begun to use dogs, which can sniff and 
detect narcotics. The police searched Dijkstra and his suitcase 
when he arrived at the airport at 0630. They discovered 12.345 
kg of heroin in 12 packages in his possession.
