SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 4A4415) has been filed by the National Food Processors Association, 1401 New York Ave. NW.,
Washington, DC 20005. The petition proposes that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe
use of chlorine dioxide to disinfect waters in contact with fresh fruits and vegetables intended for human consumption.


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before April
25, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number

environmental assessment without further announcement in the 

Federal Register

. If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition
results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
