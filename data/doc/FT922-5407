FT  30 MAY 92 / Maths criticism
PLANNING OF mathematics teaching in state schools is unsatisfactory in a
'disturbingly high' proportion of state schools, according to the schools
inspectorate.
In a report on school mathematics published yesterday, the inspectorate said
standards were 'unsatisfactory or poor' in 40 per cent of primary schools,
56 per cent of middle schools and 36 per cent of secondary schools
investigated.
