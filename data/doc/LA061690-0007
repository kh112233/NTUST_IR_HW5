JANET ADKINS' CONTROVERSIAL ASSISTED SUICIDE 
No law can effectively stop a person from ending his or her life, unless that 
person is physically totally handicapped. The issue raised by Kevorkian is 
whether there should be legally-available "professional" assistance to do it. 
Those who base their objection on their reluctance to see the medical 
profession involved are getting ahead of themselves. Only if we accept the 
notion that the option should be available, and only then, is the issue of who 
should do the assisting relevant. 
I believe a properly regulated assistance, affording proper safeguards to a 
willing patient, would do away with too many unsuccessful and horribly 
injurious suicide attempts. And hopefully it will be physicians, with their 
know-how and hopefully-improved ethics, who will do the assisting. Who else? 
Some accountant or lawyer or war vet with his undeniable expertise?
