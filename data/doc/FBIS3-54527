  [Text] The Likud welcomes King Husayn's willingness to 
meet openly with Yitzhaq Rabin and supports the signing of a 
peace treaty between Israel and Jordan. The communique issued 
by the Likud further states that the way to attain stability and 
peace is through a dialogue with Jordan and not with Yasir 
'Arafat, because as time goes by, it becomes clearer and clearer 
that one cannot rely on 'Arafat's promises.
