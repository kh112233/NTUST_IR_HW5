FT  21 JAN 94 / Technology: Whiskers transform plant cells - Worth Watching
Zeneca, the UK bioscience company, has found an astonishingly simple way of
inserting new genes into plants, writes Clive Cookson. It uses microscopic
needle-shaped crystals of silicon carbide, known as whiskers, to punch holes
into plant cells through which foreign DNA can enter.
The researcher just shakes a test tube full of water, whiskers, DNA and
cells for a few seconds with an ordinary laboratory mixer. Silicon carbide
is an extremely hard industrial chemical and its crystals are widely
available.
The patented Zeneca method is far faster and cheaper than the techniques
used elsewhere for genetic engineering of plants. The company says it has
already used whiskers to add new genes to maize - a crop that is very
difficult to transform with other techniques - and intends to apply the
method to many other plants. Zeneca Seeds: UK, 0428 655049.
