 

Section 142.16(d) was reserved effective July 30, 1992, but should contain the special primacy requirements specific
to the lead and copper rule that States are required to adopt in addition to meeting basic primacy requirements. As
explained in the July 15, 1991 (56 FR 32112) technical correction, EPA intended the lead and copper special primacy
requirements to take effect July 7, 1991. On July 30, 1992, changes to 142.16 promulgated as part of the Phase
II rulemaking (56 FR 3526, January 30, 1991) took effect. The Phase II regulations made changes to 142.16, reserved
paragraph (d) and added paragraph (e). These changes to 142.16 had the unintended effect of deleting paragraph
(d). The Agency did not intend to delete the lead and copper special primacy requirements. Rather, the Agency's intent
in reserving paragraph (d) as a part of the Phase II rulemaking was to establish a placeholder for lead and copper special
primacy requirements when the lead and copper regulations were promulgated. EPA is therefore repromulgating 142.16(d)
without revisions to restore the special primacy requirements initially promulgated in the final lead and copper
rule. 
Section 142.62(g)(2) contains a typographical error in the reference to regulations pertaining to maximum contaminant
levels (MCLs) and quality limits for bottled water. ``21 CFR 102.35'' should be ``21 CFR 103.35''. EPA is correcting
this error in today's action.

(c) ***The requirement for any small- or medium-size system to implement corrosion control
treatment steps in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section (including systems deemed to have optimized corrosion
control under paragraph (b)(1) of this section) is triggered whenever any small- or medium-size system exceeds the
