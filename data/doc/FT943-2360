FT  20 SEP 94 / Mahathir snubs ecology lobby over dam
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia has told western
environmentalists and activists to 'mind their own business' and not
interfere in Malaysia's development programmes.
Dr Mahathir was speaking at a ground breaking ceremony for the Bakun dam
project in a remote jungle area of the state of Sarawak on the island of
Borneo. The Bakun project, described by its developers as the world's
biggest private power scheme, involves construction of a dam nearly twice
the size of the Aswan dam in Egypt and the flooding of an area larger than
Singapore.
Plans are to transmit the bulk of Bakun's 2,400MW power output to peninsular
Malaysia, first by 670km of overhead cables within Sarawak and then through
650km of cables under the South China Sea. An area of more than 80,000
hectares, much of it tropical rain forest, will be cleared to accommodate
the dam and more than 8,000 tribes people will be resettled.
Opponents of the project say that the dam will be 'an ecological time bomb
sitting right in the centre of Borneo'. Earlier this year Dr Mahathir's
government signed a memorandum of understanding giving management of the
MDollars 15bn (Pounds 3.7bn) Bakun project to the Sarawak-based Ekran
company.
Ekran says 70 per cent of the financing for Bakun will be raised from
domestic resources and insists the project can be completed in six years,
without federal or state funds. Critics point out that Ekran has had no
previous experience in the power business.
Dr Mahathir said his government had done extensive research into the Bakun
project: 'Bakun will be a catalyst for industrial growth in the country and
in Sarawak itself.'
