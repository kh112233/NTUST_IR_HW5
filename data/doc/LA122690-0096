LOCAL; 
1 DEAD IN ORANGE COUNTY CRASH 
Orange County had one traffic death during the five-day Christmas holiday 
period that ended at midnight Tuesday, law officials said today. Officers said 
the Christmas-traffic fatality rate this year is obviously low given that the 
county has more than 2 million residents. 
The Orange County coroner's office said the sole traffic death during the 
five-day period was on Saturday. Deputy William King said a 19-year-old 
Fountain Valley youth lost control of his car while southbound on the San Diego 
Freeway near the Magnolia Street on-ramp. King said the car struck a call box, 
and the driver, Major J. Johnson, was fatally injured. 
Despite thousands of vehicles on the county's freeways, highways and surface 
streets, there were relatively few major traffic accidents during the holiday 
period, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department and the California 
Highway Patrol.
