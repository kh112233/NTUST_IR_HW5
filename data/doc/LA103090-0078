METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-TAX COLLECTOR GETS 5 YEARS IN INVESTMENT 
SCAM 
A former Orange County tax collector was sentenced Monday to five years in 
prison in a tax evasion and fraud case involving a gold mining investment scam. 
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon sentenced Harold Nichols, 61, after a Los 
Angeles jury found him guilty on July 10 of three counts of tax evasion, one 
count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts of using a 
false Social Security number. 
Nichols and a business partner, John Fulton, 63, raised nearly $2 million 
between 1983 and 1985 by seeking investments for purported gold mining 
ventures, then pocketed some of the cash, said Assistant U.S. Atty. David 
Sklansky. He said Nichols kept about $470,000, using the money to buy a house 
in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and to support a mistress. 
Fulton pleaded guilty to related charges last year and was sentenced in 
February to two years in prison, three years probation and a $10,000 fine.
