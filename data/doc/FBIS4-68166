  [Excerpt] Cairo, May 14 (AFP)--The militant Islamic group 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah said Saturday it had shot dead three 
policemen and wounded a fourth in the Asyut region, a 
fundamentalist stronghold in southern Egypt. 
  A statement sent to AFP from the group's armed wing said 
that 
Friday's two attacks were "part of a series planned to revenge 
the murder" on April 25 of Tal'at Yasin, the organisation's 
military leader. 
  It added they were also a warning to those who "killed the 
martyr 'Abd-al-Harith Madani" who died in detention at the end 
of April. 
  On Thursday the public prosecutor's office said initial 
autopsies showed Madani had been tortured to death. [passage
