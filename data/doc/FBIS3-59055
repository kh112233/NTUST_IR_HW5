  [Text] According to Interior Minister Manfred Kanther, 
every month 14,000 illegal immigrants come to Germany. This 
number is "unbearably large," the Christian Democratic Union 
[CDU] politician complained in a comparable meeting. Thus, what 
was reported by FOCUS two weeks ago has been officially 
established by the government: After the amendment to the Basic 
Law on asylum, almost the same number of foreigners come to the 
country illegally. The decrease in immigration only takes place 
in the statistics. Kanther reported that in 1993, 2,000 refugee 
smugglers were arrested; 97 percent of them had been foreigners. 
Otto Hauser, Baden-Wuerttemberg CDU land group chairman, called 
for a draconian punishment of up to 10 years' imprisonment for 
refugee smugglers. "There is no other way." 
  Kanther is now planning the employment of foreign officers 
as 
undercover investigators against foreign criminal gangs.
