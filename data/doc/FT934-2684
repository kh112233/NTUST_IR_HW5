FT  13 DEC 93 / Boost for fusion reactor project
The successful generation of fusion power at the Princeton Plasma Physics
Laboratory in the US is a boost for plans to spend an estimated Pounds 10bn
on an international nuclear fusion reactor in the late 1990s.
The proposed International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (Iter) would
show whether a controlled version of the fusion process which fires the sun
(and the hydrogen bomb) could deliver safe energy on earth. If the optimists
are right, fusion will become the cheapest and cleanest source of power and
heat in the middle of the next century.
In a series of experiments at the end of last week, the doughnut-shaped
Princeton reactor produced up to 5.5MW of power by joining together two
forms of 'heavy hydrogen': deuterium and tritium.
The power output was three times greater than that generated by the Joint
European Torus (Jet) - a similar reactor near Oxford in the UK - when it
achieved controlled nuclear fusion for the first time two years ago.
Iter is potentially the most ambitious global project undertaken in science.
The six-year design stage alone will cost the partners - the US, EU, Japan
and Russia - Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m). Construction would require not only
an estimated Dollars 10bn but also sufficient political goodwill to agree a
site for the reactor.
