FT  14 DEC 93 / Hamburg mayor accused of racism
The mayor of Hamburg was yesterday accused of stoking up racism by demanding
population quotas to bar non-Germans from moving into parts of Germany's
second-biggest city, Reuter reports.
Mayor Henning Voscherau told the newspaper Bild he wanted to stop the
creation of ghettos in poor neighbourhoods which were being 'threatened' by
inflows of foreigners.
'Whoever refers to 'threatened neighbourhoods' must know that he has
contributed to the anti-foreigner climate,' said government ombuds-woman Ms
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen.
She said Mr Voscherau's comments were racist propaganda: '(They) show that
he is not ready to accept that the non-German population has long since
become an integral part of the Federal Republic.'
Mr Voscherau argued there must be limits to the proportion of foreigners
living in certain neighbourhoods. 'If you have a neighbourhood where 50 per
cent or more of the residents are foreigners, then it must be possible to
say that is enough,' he said.
Germany's 6m foreign-born residents, mainly labourers from Turkey and
southern Europe, make up about 7 per cent of the total population.
