Importation of Exotic Wild Birds to the United States; Amendment of Final Rule Implementing the Wild Bird Conservation
Act of 1992


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service.

 

Action: 

Final rule. 



</AGENCY>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

On October 23, 1992, the Wild Bird Conservation Act (WBCA) was signed into law, the purposes of which include promoting
the conservation of exotic birds by: ensuring that all imports into the United States of species of exotic birds are
biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject to inhumane
treatment during capture and transport; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs in countries
of origin. This final rule amends the final rule published by the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) on November 16,
1993, in the 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60524), which implements the prohibitions stipulated in the WBCA and provides permit requirements and procedures
for some allowed exemptions. As a result of a lawsuit filed on February 15, 1994 by the Humane Society of the United States
and Defenders of Wildlife, and a resultant District Court Order that declared a portion of the contested regulation
as invalid, the Service hereby amends 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c). Notice of the Court Order was published in the 

Federal Register

 on May 24, 1994 (59 FR 26810). Consistent with that Court Order, the Service announced in that 

Federal Register

 notice that all exotic birds in listed Appendix III of The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) are covered by the automatic import moratorium of the WBCA, regardless of their country of origin.

EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This final rule is effective on the December 2, 1994.
