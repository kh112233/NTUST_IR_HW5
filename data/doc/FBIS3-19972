  [Text] Bavaria's Interior Minister Guenter Beckstein 
(Christian Social Union) has announced amendments to the law 
regarding foreigners, following the latest riots by Kurds. He 
agrees with Interior Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian 
Democratic Union) that breach of the public peace must become an 
imperative reason for deportations in the future, Beckstein said 
in Nuremberg on Wednesday [23 March]. 
  If they commit severe crimes, even asylum-seekers who have 
already been recognized as such must be deported. This is also 
possible without amending the law, because under the Geneva 
Convention these recognized asylum-seekers "impair the country's 
security and have forfeited the right to be admitted." Turkey 
has promised not to threaten those deported with death 
sentences, nor with "inappropriate treatment."
