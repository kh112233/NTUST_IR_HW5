 

(d) 

General health claim labeling requirements.

 (1) When the Administrator determines that a health claim meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section,
the Agency will notify the applicant, in writing, and will institute rulemaking to amend the regulations to authorize
the use of that claim. If the claim pertains to a substance not provided for in Part 317 of the regulations, the Administrator
will institute rulemaking to amend the regulations to include declaration of the substance. 

(2) When a regulation has been established in this Part providing for a health claim, firms may make claims based on
the regulation in this part; 

Provided,

 That: 

(i) All label or labeling statements about the substance-disease relationship that is the subject of the claim are
based on, and consistent with, the conclusions set forth in 317.371; 

(ii) The claim is limited to describing the value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion) of the substance, as part of
a total dietary pattern, may have on a particular disease or health-related condition; 

(iii) The claim is otherwise complete, truthful, and not misleading. Where factors other than dietary intake of the
substance affect the relationship between the substance and the disease or health-related condition, such factors
may be required to be addressed in the claim by a specific provision in 317.371; 

(iv) All information required to be included in the claim appears in one place without other intervening material,
except that the principal display panel of the label or labeling may bear the reference statement, ``See 

XXX

 for information about the relationship between 

XXX

 and 

XXX

,'' with the blanks filled in with the location of the labeling containing the health claim, the name of the substance,
and the disease or health-related condition (e.g., ``See attached pamphlet for information about calcium and osteoporosis''),
with the entire claim appearing elsewhere on the other labeling; 

Provided,

 That, where any graphic material (e.g., a heart symbol) constituting an explicit or implied health claim appears
on the label or labeling, the reference statement or the complete claim shall appear in immediate proximity to such
graphic material; 

(v) The claim enables the public to comprehend the information provided and to understand the relative significance
of such information in the context of the total daily diet; and 

(vi) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance
in the meat or meat food product is sufficiently low to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition
for use of the term ``low'' has been established for that substance under this Part, the substance must be present at
a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established
for the substance in 317.371. If no definition for ``low'' has been established, the level of the substance
must meet the level established in the regulation authorizing the claim; or 

(vii) If the claim is about the effects of consuming the substance at other than decreased dietary levels, the level
of the substance is sufficiently high to justify the claim. To meet this requirement, if a definition for use of the
term ``high'' for that substance has been established under this Part, the substance must be present at a level that
meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative level has been established for the substance
in 317.371. If no definition for ``high'' has been established (e.g., where the claim pertains to a food either
as a whole food or as an ingredient in another food), the claim must specify the daily dietary intake necessary to achieve
the claimed effect, as established in the regulation authorizing the claim; 

Provided,

 That, where the meat or meat food product that bears the claim meets the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(vi) or (d)(2)(vii)
of this section based on its reference amount customarily consumed, and the labeled serving size differs from that
amount, the claim shall be followed by a statement explaining that the claim is based on the reference amount rather
than the labeled serving size (e.g., ``Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated
with many factors. A serving 

XXX

 of ounces of this product conforms to such a diet.'') 

(3) Nutrition labeling shall be provided in the label or labeling of any meat or meat food product for which a health
claim is made in accordance with 317.309.
