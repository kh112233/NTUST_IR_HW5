department for issues of chemical weapons of the Committee for 
Convention-Related Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons, 
by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondents Andrey Vaganov and Rodion 
Nikolayev, under the rubric "Position"; place and date not 
given: "Russia Has Not Violated Any Treaties on Chemical 
Weapons. As Far as Destroying These Weapons, It Is as Difficult 
as Creating Them"] 
  [Text] One year ago, Russia was among the first 
countries to sign in Paris the Convention on Prohibition of the 
Development, Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical 
Weapons and on Their Destruction. This event completed the 
proceedings of more than two decades of negotiations at the 
disarmament conference in Geneva. 
  The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical 
Weapons which is headquartered in the Hague (the Netherlands) 
was created in order to carry out the convention and implement 
an international control mechanism. In Russia, the Committee on 
Convention-Related Problems of Chemical and Biological Weapons 
was also created in 1992 by an edict of the Russian Federation 
president. The committee was charged with the functions of 
coordination and control in the area of ensuring compliance with 
Russia's international obligations concerning the ban on 
chemical and biological weapons. Professor Aleksandr Gorbovskiy, 
chief of the department for the issues of chemical weapons of 
the committee, answers questions put by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondents. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: Aleksandr Dmitriyevich, what 
is the status of implementing the convention as of today? 
  Gorbovskiy: The convention has been signed. A 
period of two years has been set for participating countries to 
be able to ratify it and prepare to meet their obligations. The 
convention will take effect when no fewer than 65 states ratify 
it. 
  The convention has now been signed by 154 states, but 
ratified by only four countries, which do not have chemical 
weapons and which actually do not have to assume any 
obligations. This is a very serious problem for other countries 
that do have such weapons: The conditions and facilities for the 
destruction of chemical weapons need to be created. 
  The main proportion of the world stockpiles of such weapons 
are concentrated in the United States and Russia. This is why 
the issue of destroying chemical weapons is the most acute for 
these two states. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What does the Russian 
chemical weapons complex amount to? One finds absolutely 
contradictory information in the press. 
  Gorbovskiy: The Russian chemical weapons complex 
means first of all the stockpiles kept at storage facilities. 
The total quantity of the stockpiles has been declared and comes 
to 40,000 tonnes of toxic substances (OV). 
  Russia also has facilities for the production of toxic 
substances. The principal facilities are in Volgograd and 
Novocheboksarsk (Chuvashia). 
  Last year an interdepartmental commission whose task it was 
to inspect all storage facilities for toxic substances verified 
the reliability of chemical weapons storage and provisions for 
the safety of the population. As chairman of the above 
commission, I can confirm the number given--40,000 tonnes. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: Is it possible to say what 
the qualitative composition of these 40,000 tonnes is, and in 
which regions Russian chemical weapons are mostly located? 
  Gorbovskiy: The most up-to-date nerve 
substances--sarin, soman, and V-gas [vi-gaz], account for 
approximately 32,000 tonnes. The remainder consists of obsolete 
substances, mustard gas and lewisite, which have been stored 
since as early as the 1950's. 
  Data on the geography of the locations of such weapons are 
no 
longer secret. We have exchanged information with the Americans 
on the military-chemical facilities; the geographical 
coordinates of their locations precise to the second have been 
provided. All these facilities are located in the European 
section of Russia. 
  We have seven storage sites. Toxic substances (mustard gas, 
lewisite) are kept in containers at two sites. Storage is within 
munitions at five sites. Two storage facilities out of these 
five hold missile and artillery munitions, and three storage 
sites--aircraft chemical munitions. 
  The easternmost facility is in Chelyabinsk Oblast. Those in 
Bryansk and Penza Oblasts are the closest to Moscow. The 40,000 
tonnes are distributed among these storage facilities 
approximately evenly--at 5,000-7,000 tonnes per storage site. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What is the guaranteed shelf 
life of chemical munitions? 
  Gorbovskiy: More than 80 percent of toxic 
substances are found within munitions whose bodies ensure their 
reliable storage. The inspection of arsenals revealed that a 
case of leakage has not been registered at any of them recently. 
  American chemical munitions have thinner shells. This is 
precisely why their chemical munitions have become disabled 
sooner. For example, rocket artillery munitions "leaked" by the 
mid-1970's. The Americans were forced to encase them in concrete 
and dump them in the ocean. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What is 40,000 tonnes equal 
to in terms of, so to say, destruction coefficient? 
  Gorbovskiy: A lethal dose of V-gas, the most 
up-to-date chemical toxic agent, comes to 10 milligrams per 
person. This is a virtually invisible aerosol particle. It is 
easy to calculate the number of potential victims by simple 
division if we know the total stockpiles of chemical weapons. 
However, this would be an incompetent calculation; it does not 
take into account actual conditions for the use of all weapons. 
For example, if we compare how much explosive was used during 
World War II and the number of people who were destroyed, it 
will turn out that there were hundreds of kilograms of 
trinitrotoluene per person killed. 
  The same is the case in the event of combat use of chemical 
weapons--kilograms and tens of kilograms of toxic substances per 
each casualty. Approximately the same casualty rate should also 
be reckoned with during accidents. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What are the specifics of 
Russian problems associated with implementation of the 
provisions of the convention? 
  Gorbovskiy: Unfortunately we have to begin work in 
the area of chemical weapons destruction virtually from scratch. 
After the former USSR announced the discontinuation of chemical 
weapons production (1987), a facility for the destruction of 
toxic substances was created in the vicinity of the city of 
Chapayevsk within a very short period of time. About 100 million 
rubles in 1989 prices were spent to this end. 
  However, this facility was not commissioned, after all. The 
local population protested strongly. Technologies that were 
supposed to be used at the facility were evaluated to be safer 
than American technologies even by specialists from the United 
States. Many other industrial enterprises are located in 
Chapayevsk, and the ecological situation in the region was very 
strained. There was absolutely no opportunity to coordinate the 
commissioning of the facility with the local authorities and the 
public. 
  Subsequently, major studies were done to develop a draft of 
the state program for the destruction of chemical weapons. As a 
result, specialists came to the conclusion that it would be 
safest and most economical to use for destruction available 
former facilities for the production of toxic substances; after 
all, in this case the entire infrastructure did not have to be 
created from scratch. In particular, a plant in the city of 
Novocheboksarsk was proposed (the V-gas toxic substance had been 
produced there previously). However, following discussion of a 
draft program at the beginning of last year, the legislative 
organ of Chuvashia made a decision which ruled out the use of 
the Novocheboksarsk Production Association Khimprom for the 
purpose of destroying a proportion of the stock of chemical 
weapons. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What is the price tag on the 
program for the destruction of chemical weapons? 
  Gorbovskiy: It is very expensive--a few trillion 
rubles. The following concept is now taking shape: Chemical 
weapons will have to be destroyed directly in the area of the 
facilities at which they are stored. A major effort to 
coordinate all issues with the local organs of power and the 
public lies ahead. 
  In conjunction with this, certain articles of an instigatory 
and even intimidating nature seriously harm an objective 
assessment of the situation. Thus, one year ago articles 
appeared in the newspapers of the Republic of Chuvashia about 
V-gas contamination in a 30-kilometer zone around 
Novocheboksarsk. The interdepartmental commission dispatched 
there for a survey did not confirm this fact. Analysis of the 
samples of various media made in specialized laboratories 
indicated an absence of contamination. 
  One more dangerous trend has begun to manifest itself--to 
combine the program for the destruction of chemical weapons with 
the resolution of ecological problems associated with the 
operation of industry as such. All this causes the program to 
become still more expensive. As a result, a situation might 
develop in which Russia will be simply unable to carry out the 
program on time. Meanwhile, according to the convention, the 
first facility for the destruction of toxic substances should 
already be in operation two years after the convention is 
ratified. In five years, 20 percent of the chemical weapons 
should be destroyed, in seven years--50 percent, and in 10 
years--100 percent. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: More than a year ago 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI published the notorious article by Vil 
Mirzoyanov and Lev Fedorov "Poisoned Politics." The trial of one 
of the authors of the article began on Monday. He stands accused 
of divulging state secrets with regard to the development of a 
new type of chemical weapon in our country. Could you comment on 
the situation? 
  Gorbovskiy: At one point I, as a representative of 
the Committee on Convention-Related Problems, provided 
explanations at a briefing concerning charges by Mirzoyanov and 
Fedorov that Russia is violating the international obligations 
it has assumed. I confirm officially that Russia has not 
violated any international agreements in the area of the ban on 
chemical weapons, either at the time this article was written or 
at present. 
  Since the production of toxic substances was discontinued in 
1987, by the USSR, it has not resumed; the plants were either 
mothballed or their output mix was changed. I am certain that 
the American side is also well aware of this: U.S. specialists 
have visited former Russian facilities for the production of 
chemical weapons. Besides, there are satellite monitoring 
systems. Incidentally, the Americans themselves, precisely in 
1987, embarked on the industrial manufacturing of binary 
weapons--the outcome of the program for modernizing their 
chemical weapons. It is precisely binary chemical weapons that 
are the hardest to control within the framework of the 
convention. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: What can you say about the 
charges that new types of chemical weapons are being developed 
in Russia? Does the fact that the Novichok-5 new chemical agent 
has been developed conform to the truth? 
  Gorbovskiy: This problem falls within the 
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian 
Federation rather than our committee. Legally, not a single 
state is banned from such activities at present. This ban will 
only apply to countries that have ratified the convention once 
it takes effect. 
  It is known that research on binary chemical weapons has 
been 
conducted in many countries. The experience gained by chemical 
scientists is now being used to create international monitoring 
mechanisms. Besides, the length of time between a reaction in a 
test tube and the creation of weapons is many years or even 
decades. 
  If disclosure of information on methods for the generation 
of 
toxic substances has occurred, this is undoubtedly a dangerous 
path leading to the uncontrollable spread of chemical weapons 
and the emergence of chemical terrorism. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA: The article "Poisoned 
Politics" was written by two authors--Mirzoyanov [spelling of 
name as published] and Fedorov. Nonetheless, at present only 
Mirzoyanov is on trial. What is this about? 
  Gorbovskiy: As far as I know, Mirzoyanov worked 
with secret information at the GosNIIOKhT [State Union 
Scientific-Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and 
Technology] and, naturally, signed a pledge not to divulge state 
secrets. This is why charges were filed against him. As far as 
Fedorov is concerned, he proclaims that he has never read secret 
documents anywhere nor has he signed any pledges. 
  This begs the following question: What does Fedorov stand 
for 
as a specialist? Here is the opinion of him by scientists who 
know his past activities well. 
  Lev Fedorov received his college education at the department 
of chemistry of Moscow State University while being the party 
organizer of the class, with all requisite privileges for study 
existing at the time. Subsequently, there was graduate study and 
defense of a candidate dissertation. However, some time later it 
came out that the results of his work could not be confirmed. 
His science adviser experienced major unpleasantness because of 
that. 
  The first defense of a doctoral dissertation by Fedorov 
before the Learned Council of the imeni A.N. Nesmeyanov 
Institute of Element-Organic Compounds failed for an altogether 
simple reason--plagiarism. Scientific statements which the 
author passed off as his turned out to have been borrowed from 
the works of domestic and foreign scientists. 
  Several years ago, having failed to achieve particular 
scientific success, Lev Fedorov suddenly took an intense 
interest in dioxins (organic compounds containing chlorine which 
are the byproducts of certain chemical production processes and 
pose a certain danger to humans). Lacking his own 
scientific-practical works on this issue at the time, Fedorov 
nonetheless mounted vigorous activities in this area. Mistaking 
him for a dioxin specialist, the scientific community of the 
city of Ufa invited Fedorov to participate in the development of 
the Republic Program for the Evaluation of Dioxin Contamination 
of the Natural Environment in 1992. Strangely, this specialist 
did not make any practically significant proposals, and refused 
to serve on the commission after the very first meeting. 
  Undoubtedly, incompetent people such as Lev Fedorov should 
not be commenting on an important area such as the problem of 
chemical disarmament.
