FT  13 JUN 94 / Tunnel freight service to Milan starts tonight
The Channel tunnel is to start a freight container service to Italy tonight.
Until now the UK rail network has provided few routes long enough to make
freight transport economic. The tunnel provides fast direct links to
Continental destinations.
The container service is being run by Combined Transport (CTL), a joint
venture owned by European haulage companies and British Rail's freight
division.
The first long-distance freight train carrying containers will leave
Wembley, west London, tonight and arrive in Milan early on Wednesday. Its
load will consist of containers and 'swapbodies' - bodies which can be
detached from a lorry chassis.
The inaugural train will carry 20 to 22 containers or swapbodies, each
holding a cargo weighing up to 50 tonnes. The through-tunnel train will
consist of loads from Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham.
The service will initially consist of two or three trains a day to and from
France, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Italy. From September the service will
extend to destinations in Austria and Spain. Mr Francois Leclercq, CTL
managing director, said Germany might be added but it was proving difficult
to obtain attractive rates for German destinations.
Journey times should be about half those by road and much less than the time
taken by rail and ferry. Glasgow to Paris is expected to take 21 hours,
Manchester to Milan 33 hours and London to Madrid 36 hours.
An evacuation rehearsal of a Channel Tunnel passenger train was marred on
Saturday by a power failure that stalled the train in the tunnel with 800
people on it. The incident was caused by a short-circuit, and the train was
towed to England by a conventional diesel engine.
Passenger services are scheduled to start next month.
