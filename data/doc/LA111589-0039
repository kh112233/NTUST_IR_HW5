SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
After hearing final instructions Tuesday morning from U. S. District Judge Earl 
B. Gilliam, the jury in the fraud and tax-evasion trial of Nancy Hoover Hunter 
began deliberating the 197 charges against the former J. David and Co. 
executive. 
The seven-woman, five-man jury received instructions for about an hour before 
beginning what promises to be many days of deliberations. 
Gilliam instructed the jury on the technical aspects of the law affecting the 
six categories of charges against Hunter -- conspiracy, income-tax evasion, 
aiding and abetting in the preparation of false tax returns, making false 
statements to a government agency, mail fraud and fraud by a commodities pool 
operator. 
Hunter faces 197 counts in an indictment that alleges that she played an active 
role in the giant J. David Ponzi scheme. When the La Jolla brokerage house was 
forced into involuntary bankruptcy in February, 1984, about 1,200 investors 
lost $80 million. 
Hunter's former lover, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, is serving a 20-year prison 
term for masterminding the fraud. 
Since the trial began in April, Hunter's attorneys have been trying to persuade 
the jury that their client was kept completely in the dark about Dominelli's 
fraud. The defense contends that Dominelli and his inner circle of associates 
constantly lied to Hunter about his alleged money trading and that Hunter was 
blinded by love for him. 
The jury will be considering the testimony of about 150 witnesses, as well as 
2,000 pieces of evidence. 
Court observers predict prolonged deliberations. Apparently the jurors expect 
the same; only 90 minutes after the start of their deliberations they asked 
Gilliam for a Nov. 24 vacation day.
