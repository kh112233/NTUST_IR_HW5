  [Text] Amman (J.T.)--Jordanian officials said on Saturday 
[2 April] a Washington meeting of top U.S. bodies in charge of 
searches of ships heading to the Kingdom had been postponed 
until next week. 
  The meeting to review the searches aimed at goods that might 
be transhipped to Iraq, initially had been scheduled to be held 
at the State Department on Thursday, Reuter said. 
  It has been delayed until next Wednesday to allow more time 
to study a three-month-old Jordanian proposal to replace 
offshore with onshore inspections by a third party. 
  His Majesty King Husayn said Monday Jordan would not resume 
peace talks with Israel if the disruptive searches by U.S.-led 
navies enforcing U.N. trade sanctions against Iraq continued. 
  Officials say the inspection has been tightened recently to 
pressure Jordan into signing a peace deal with Israel. 
  Under the proposal expected to be discussed by U.S. 
officials 
on Wednesday, the sea-based inspection by the U.S.-led forces 
will be moved to the port of al-'Aqabah. 
  Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Tuesday that 
Jordan 
felt that the proposal was not given the proper attention it 
deserved since enough time had passed for studying the proposal 
but no action had been taken. 
  A group of Jordanian officials, businessmen and shipping 
agents held a televised debate last week with the secretary of 
the U.N. Sanctions Committee. They explained the negative 
impact of the sanctions enforcement in its present form on 
Jordan's economy. The Sanctions Committee official promised 
that the Kingdom's grievances will be placed before the 
committee.
