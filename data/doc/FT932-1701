FT  22 JUN 93 / Car bombs kill seven in Madrid
POLICE experts examine the scene after the second of two car bombs exploded
during the morning rush hour in central Madrid yesterday. The first, four
blocks away and 45 minutes earlier, killed five senior military officers, a
sergeant and a civilian driver who were travelling in an unmarked minibus to
general staff headquarters. More than 25 people were injured in the two
blasts. The second went off near the American embassy and both bombs bore
the hallmarks of the Basque separatist Eta guerrillas, a group widely
believed to have been cornered and disarmed. Eta suffered a setback in
elections this month when its political front organisation, Herri Batasuna,
lost two of the four seats it had held in parliament.
