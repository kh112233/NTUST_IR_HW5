FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: GM sceptical over VW plant
VOLKSWAGEN has failed to convince General Motors that its plans for a
revolutionary car plant in Spain are not a copy of a project drafted
previously by the US group.
'We have a right to be sceptical,' Mr David Herman, chairman of GM's German
subsidiary Adam Opel, said yesterday. 'It would be a real tour de force' if
Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, GM's former procurement chief who is now
at VW, had managed to develop a new concept between mid-March, when he left
the US, and mid-June when he announced VW's plans.
Mr Herman was responding to claims in a letter received from VW in which Mr
Ferdinand Piech, chairman, said the German company did not have any
confidential plans or documents about GM's ultra-low-cost factory project.
Mr Herman confirmed that he had written to Mr Piech before Mr Lopez's
announcement, suggesting that he consider the possible consequences if VW's
project were the same as the one developed at GM under Mr Lopez's direction.
At the time Mr Herman wrote, German state prosecutors were investigating the
US group's complaints that Mr Lopez and colleagues took secret documents
with them when they moved to VW. The German company has consistently
rebutted the charges.
