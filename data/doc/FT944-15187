FT  19 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Bank launches Baltic hedge
fund
Banks in the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are seeking
dollar-denominated assets through a new investment fund which will buy local
bank Treasury bills and certificates of deposit.
The Baltic Cash Fund, an offshore hedge fund registered in the Cayman
Islands, has been launched by Latvia's International Bank of Riga and its
wholly-owned fund management subsidiary, Baltic Asset Management (BAML). The
two British directors of BAML are directors of Quantec, a UK-based
consulting firm specialising in active quantitative fund management
applications.
The fund, which has applied for listing on the Irish stock exchange, hopes
to raise Dollars 40m from large institutional investors with minimum
investments of Dollars 100,000 each.
It will invest primarily in short-dated bank paper with an average maturity
of 60 days from Latvia and Lithuania, and in commercial paper from Estonia.
Fund managers said rates on these instruments can be as high as 25 per cent
for US dollar-denominated bank CDs; government Treasury bills, in local
currency, can earn more than 20 per cent.
'These rates reflect the shortage of the hard currency required by the banks
for lending to local enterprises as the Baltic economies continue to develop
rapidly,' said Mr Aigar Sevels, chief executive officer of BAML. He said
Baltic entrepreneurs needed hard currency for trade with neighbouring
countries such as Russia, where the soft rouble fell by more than 30 per
cent in the first 11 days of October.
