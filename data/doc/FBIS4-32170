  [Text] Bratislava, June 17 (CTK) -- Slovak Interior 
Minister Ladislav Pittner told CTK today a definitive conclusion 
on the Czech-Slovak border was conditional upon the solution to 
the issue of a small area of Czech weekend cottage owners called 
Kasarna to which Slovakia raises a claim. 
  In an interview for CTK, Pittner said that "the Czech party 
must drop its claim to the Kasarna area in exchange for another 
territory and recognize that for Slovakia the area is important 
and attractive by its character, and that it is not only a 
matter of territorial compensation." 
  Kasarna, now administratively part of north Moravia, has 
been 
an object of discords between the Czechs and Slovaks for several 
centuries. 
  Pittner said that the area was to be discussed by the Czech 
and Slovak premiers, Vaclav Klaus and Jozef Moravcik, when they 
meet within the World Economic Forum which opened in 
Crans-Montana, Switzerland, today. 
  Pittner and his Czech counterpart, Jan Ruml, are to meet on 
the Czech territory next week to discuss some pending questions 
related to the introduction of a standard border regime and some 
technical questions related to the addendum to the Czech-Slovak 
visa-free agreement which specifies certain articles of the 
agreement. The addendum was approved by the Slovak Government 
earlier this week. 
  It is to be signed by the Czech and Slovak foreign 
ministers, 
Josef Zieleniec and Eduard Kukan, at their meeting in Prague on 
Monday [20 June].
