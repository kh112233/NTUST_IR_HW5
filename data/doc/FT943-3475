FT  14 SEP 94 / Irish government moves to maintain impetus on peace
The Irish government yesterday moved to maintain the momentum behind the
peace process after Monday's loyalist bomb attack in central Dublin and as
violence broke out yesterday in north Belfast, John Murray Brown writes.
Senior Dublin civil servants opened talks with Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, in preparation for the all-party Forum for Peace and
Reconciliation which the republic hopes to convene before the end of
October. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has pushed for an
early convening of the forum to commit Sinn Fein to the democratic process,
bolstering the moderates at the expense of hardliners after the IRA's
announcement of a cessation of hostilities.
Although Mr Reynolds has repeated his wish that unionist parties will join
the forum, both leading parties - the Official Ulster Unionists and the
Democratic Unionists - seem likely to decline. Unionist officials are
resentful about what they see as Dublin's attempt to steamroll the process.
Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, last night said unionists
should prepare for 'political battle' when the British and Irish governments
publish their framework document - which is expected next month - laying out
proposals for political progress.
Meanwhile, in north Belfast, vehicles were hijacked and shots fired after
violent clashes in the city's crown court. The trial of a Roman Catholic man
accused of the attempted murder of loyalist Mr Johnny Adair had to be
adjourned after fighting between supporters of the two men. Police moved a
crowd of 40 loyalists into the Crumlin Road. Trouble then spread to the
nearby Protestant Shankill Road and continued sporadically into the night.
In a separate incident last night, a Protestant man was shot in the leg on
the northern outskirts of Belfast.
