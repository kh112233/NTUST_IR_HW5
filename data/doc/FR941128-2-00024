business in Wilmette, Illinois. The patent rights in these inventions have been assigned to the United States of America.

The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. While the primary purpose of this notice is to announce NTIS' intent to grant an exclusive license
to practice the noted patents, it also serves to publish said patents' availability for licensing in accordance with
law. The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within 90 days from the date of this published notice,
NTIS receives written evidence and argument which establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent
with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.

The series of related inventions expressed in the patents cited above describe various peptides, endorphins and
enkephalins believed to be beneficial in the therapeutic treatment of a range of conditions believed to be caused
by defective brain mechanisms, including various forms of mental illness.

Copies of the instant patents are available from the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Box 9, Washington, DC
at a cost of $3.00 each.

Any inquiries and comments relating to the contemplated license must be submitted to Neil L. Mark, Office of Federal
Patent Licensing, NTIS, Box 1423, Springfield, Virginia 22151. Properly filed competing license applications
received by the NTIS in response to this notice will be considered as objections to the grant of the contemplated license.
