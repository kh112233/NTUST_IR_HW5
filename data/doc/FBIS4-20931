Tried To Develop Biological Weapons"] 
  [Text] Prague -- The dangerous organisms that 
Czechoslovak scientists were studying in military establishments 
in the seventies and eighties included, for example, the Muray 
Valley encephalitis virus, which originates in Australia; a 
virus called St. Louis encephalitis; bacteria of the Japanese B 
encephalitis, strain "schun" [word as published]; or the virus 
of the "murman" seal species. These microorganisms cause mainly 
inflammations of the meninx; they have a very severe clinical 
progression and a lethal conclusion. The former Soviet Union 
asked the former government for an analysis of the above 
microorganisms. 
  Czech scientists supposedly never worked with the most 
dangerous infections such as smallpox, pestilence, or anthrax. 
  According to Ales Macela, dean of scientific activity at the 
Jan Evangelista Purkyne Military Medical Academy in Hradec 
Kralove, conditions have never been established in the Czech 
Republic for handling of genetic material of microorganisms or 
for the production of a larger quantity of microbes, which would 
have been necessary for the development and production of a 
biological weapon.
