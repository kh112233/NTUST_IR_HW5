FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Warburg in South African link-up
SG Warburg, the investment bank, yesterday announced a link-up with a
leading South African stockbroking firm to help it capitalise on a surge of
investor interest in that country following its first multi-racial
elections.
Warburg said it had reached agreement with Ivor, Jones, Roy and Co, an
agency stockbroker, for exclusive rights to distribute its research about
South African shares to Warburg clients around the world and particularly in
the US.
In addition, the parties have agreed in principle that Warburg will acquire
up to 50 per cent of the shares of IJR once this is permitted by the South
African Stock Exchange and domestic legislation.
Mr Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, Warburg deputy chairman, said the company may also
pursue other activities in South Africa although the form of participation
has not yet been determined.
Warburg becomes the second leading UK investment bank this week to announce
plans to capitalise on the expected demand for South African equities.
With a multi-racial government in place, US public sector pension schemes in
particular are beginning to lift decades-long bans on investment in South
Africa.
However, US investment banks have little expertise in selecting South
African investments because of the absence of links and are thus poorly
placed to offer advice.
