FT  02 JUN 94 / World Trade News: S African drive for trade with US
The new South African government and the country's private-sector Foreign
Trade Organisation yesterday announced a big trade and investment initiative
to strengthen ties with the US after years of economic isolation and
sanctions.
In Washington yesterday, Mr Trevor Manuel, South African trade and industry
minister, said that the US and South African governments are working on
various bilateral initiatives, including an investment pact, a double
taxation treaty, and a conference in Atlanta to start tomorrow.
South Africa plans to hold its largest trade exposition ever, on September
20-23 in New York City's convention centre. This will feature 150 South
African businesses from a broad range of industries, including clothing,
textile, furniture, domestic appliances, base materials, agricultural and
industrial equipment, banking and financial services.
Mr Manuel said the new government expects companies doing business in South
Africa to adhere voluntarily to affirmative action plans for women and black
people.
The US commerce department, believing South Africa to be the key to trade in
all of southern Africa, has marked the country for special attention by
putting it on its list of 10 Emerging Markets, where it expects exports to
grow the most.
Also, the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation is increasing its
investment insurance in South Africa to Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m). The US
Export-Import Bank last year lifted conditions imposed because of apartheid.
US exports to South Africa stand at Dollars 2.2bn, with South African
exports to the US at nearly Dollars 2bn.
