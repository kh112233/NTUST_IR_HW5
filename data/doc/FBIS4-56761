  [Text] Pretoria, 9 May (PL) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
told PRENSA LATINA today that to attend Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration for president of South Africa is a historic 
experience for the peoples of Cuba and the world. 
  Castro made the remark as he boarded an airplane in Accra, 
the capital of Ghana, after a 12-hour stopover en route to 
Pretoria, where the first black president in South African 
history will take office on 10 May. 
  "I am very pleased to have stopped over in Ghana and to have 
met with the Ghanaian people," said the Cuban leader, whom 
Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings welcomed last night at 
Katoka Airport. 
  Concerning his meeting with Rawlings, a longtime friend, 
Castro said he was very pleased, although the meeting was very 
brief, because Rawlings was also traveling to South Africa. 
  Castro's trip to South Africa is an important, historic 
event. Mandela was in jail just five years ago for trying to 
eliminate the system of apartheid and when Cuban troops were 
fighting in southern Angola against the South African Army.
