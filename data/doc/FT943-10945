FT  02 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Caparo close to US steelmaking purchase
Caparo Group, the privately-owned UK steel and engineering concern,
confirmed yesterday it was close to making its biggest acquisition to date
by buying most of the steelmaking assets of Pennsylvania-based Sharon
Specialty Steel.
Mr Swraj Paul, the Anglo-Indian businessman who founded and chairs Caparo,
said the company had signed a letter of intent to buy Sharon, which is
operating under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code.
Terms were not disclosed, but Caparo hopes to reach a definitive agreement
on the purchase by September 4, with final closing set for November 1.
Sharon would trade as a new US subsidiary, Caparo Steel.
If the deal goes through, it would transform the shape and size of Caparo
Group, turning it into a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) company through the
combination of Dollars 400m of sales from Sharon and the current worldwide
total of Pounds 360m.
Caparo has already made acquisitions in the US steel industry, but Mr Paul
said the takeover 'is a vehicle to become somebody in steel in the US'. The
timing of the deal was good, he said, with the strength of the US steel
market, and 'steel is a business we know inside out'.
Sharon has been in the court-administered Chapter 11 process since November
1992 and had undertaken to find a buyer by August 31 this year.
Caparo would initially operate Sharon's electric furnace, blooming mill and
hot strip mill with 450 unionised hourly workers and 90 salaried people. It
aims to be producing 1m tonnes per year of hot-rolled high and low carbon
steel in the second year of operations. Caparo will invest Dollars 15m to
help finance start-up activities and make initial productivity improvements.
Ultimately, Caparo said it would further invest sufficient capital to
develop Caparo Steel as a 'low cost' competitive producer.
