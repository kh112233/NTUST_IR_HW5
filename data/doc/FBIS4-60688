  [Text] It has been announced in New York that four Arab 
Muslims who were accused in the World Trade Center bombing case 
have been sentenced to 240 years in prison. 
  The JANA international affairs editor commented on this 
sentence, saying: The sentence passed on those four has no 
meaning other than the destruction and utmost degradation of a 
human being's humanity and his sense of it. 
  In this regard, the editor referred to what the brother 
leader of the revolution said in his address at the final 
emergency session of the General People's Congress six years 
ago, in which he revealed the repressive methods practiced in 
America against human beings and their humanity. 
  He said that a 50-year-old person in America, for example, 
is 
given a prison sentence of 100 years. Since this person knows 
that he will not live for this period, the sentence is 
contemptuous of the human psyche--destroying and degrading 
it--and humiliates and harms that person at that moment when the 
sentence is passed. 
  The editor asks where the human rights are that they brag 
about in the West if these are their practices that do not give 
the slightest value to the human being. At the very least, 
these practices can be described as barbaric, savage, and brutal.
