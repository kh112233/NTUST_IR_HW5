FT  22 NOV 93 / All-women shortlists unworkable
A rule demanding all-woman shortlists in some parliamentary seats is
unworkable, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's former deputy leader, said
yesterday. The idea that Labour headquarters could tell a constituency it
could not choose its own candidate would be resisted fiercely, he said on
BBC television.
He said: 'It is tragic that the Labour Party should be getting itself into
another constituency argument at this time. The cause is absolutely right,
that more women must be in parliament to represent Labour. 'But this way of
doing it is going to produce chaos and is absolutely unworkable. This will
actually set the cause of women's representation back as some the other
half-cock measures have set it back'.
If positive steps were being taken for women they ought also to to be taken
for blacks and Asians who were 'pathetically under-represented' in the
parliamentary party.
