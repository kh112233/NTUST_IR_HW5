FT  28 FEB 92 / FDA unable to monitor over-the-counter drugs
THE US Food and Drug Administration has insufficient mechanisms for
approving and monitoring the safety of non-prescription drugs sold
over-the-counter, a Congressional report warned yesterday, writes Alan
Friedman from New York.
The report, by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, found numerous examples of health hazards associated with widely
used over-the-counter drugs.
It stressed, however, that while the FDA has full authority to examine the
safety and effectiveness of prescription drugs, this is not the case for
over-the-counter products.
Members of the House of Representatives small business committee, which
commissioned the GAO report, are seeking a more rigorous system under which
the FDA can review non-prescription drugs.
The over-the-counter drug market had Dollars 11.2bn of sales in 1990, with
more than 125,000 different products available, according to the GAO report.
