  [Text] Most of the economic indicators for January-March 
1994 point to an expansion of economic activity conforming with 
the annual forecast, according to a survey of developments in 
the economy published yesterday by Tzipi Gal-Yam, the Treasury's 
economic adviser. 
  The data does not reflect the impact of the closure on the 
territories, and the Treasury says it is still too early to 
discern its impact. 
  The survey notes that in the first quarter of 1994 the 
number 
of jobless dropped by 23 percent compared to the same period 
last year, and that there was an increase of 28 percent in 
tourism, and 12 percent in state revenues from taxes. Retail 
trade went up 15 percent and imports of consumer goods by 18 
percent. 
  In the first quarter of 1994, there was a 22 percent 
increase 
in the import of investment assets compared to the same period 
last year, as well as in the import of raw materials, and a 
growth of 5.4 percent in the export of goods. 
  The index went up higher than anticipated in January-March, 
but it is still lower than the same period over the past two 
years. 
  The Treasury noted that it is still too early to decide if 
the economy has exceeded its aim of 8 percent inflation this 
year. 
  It was also said that there is stability in the financial 
markets and that they have even shrunk following a bullish 
period in the stock exchange in the last quarter of 1993.
