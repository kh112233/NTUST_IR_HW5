Nutrition Labeling of Ground Beef and Hamburger

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations by permitting
percentage labeling for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger, provided such product labeling contains nutrition
information. This proposed rule would provide increased flexibility in the labeling of ground beef and hamburger,
and would also allow consumers to readily identify and differentiate between the varying lean/fat percentages of
these products. FSIS is taking this action in response to comments received after publication of the final nutrition
labeling regulations and a petition submitted by Western States Meat Association, Oakland, CA, and encourages comments
on all aspects of the proposed rule including nutrition information.

 Comments must be received on or before July 8, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 

Executive Order 12866 



FSIS has determined that this proposed rule is significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. FSIS has assessed
the impacts of its proposed rule that would permit percentage labeling for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger.
This rule would provide an incentive to maintain or reduce fat in ground beef and hamburger which represent over 45
percent of the domestic beef supply. About 41 percent of the ground beef is sold through retail outlets. 



Benefits of the Proposed Rule 



Without this rule, processors and retailers of raw ground beef and hamburger would be essentially prohibited from
making any lean or extra lean claims. Some producers of hamburger have made substantial strides in reducing the fat
content which has been communicated as ``

XX

 percent lean.'' The provisions of the proposed rule allow for presentation of objective and truthful information
that would enable consumers to distinguish among products that range anywhere from 10 to 30 percent fat by weight.
Consumers would obtain health benefits by seeing terms with which they are familiar and have used since 1973 to select
leaner versions of these ground products. The labeling flexibility should provide manufacturers and retailers
an incentive to maintain or reduce fat content in ground beef and hamburger. By requiring nutrition labeling and ``

XX

 percent fat,'' whenever a product displays the ``

XX

 percent lean'' content, industry is given a greater incentive to market and promote reduced fat ground beef products
with higher lean contents than would occur under the final nutrition labeling regulations to take effect on July 6,
1994. FSIS believes that this nutrition information helps consumers make better food choices and provides incentives
to continue producing nutritionally-improved products which contribute substantially to the health benefits
associated with nutrition labeling. FSIS believes that this exemption is properly limited to ground beef products
due to the past labeling practices of using lean and extra lean terms primarily on ground beef products. If there is
sufficient interest to extend this flexibility to other ground product, the final analysis will assess the benefits
and costs. 



Costs of the Proposed Rule 



The cost of the proposed regulations for nutrition labeling of ground beef and hamburger consists of presenting complete
nutrition information obtained from existing databases on the labeling of the product or in the form of point-of-purchase
materials when percentage labeling for lean and fat is used. The products on which FSIS is proposing to permit the percentage
labeling are single-ingredient, raw ground beef products that fall under the voluntary nutrition labeling program
if they do not contain added seasoning.
