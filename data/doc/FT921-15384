FT  10 JAN 92 / Hovertrain cleared for take-off
Germany's 'whispering arrow', a 400kph (250mph) levitating magnetic
hovertrain, could be flying by the end of the decade, writes Christopher
Parkes.
After 24 years' development and a 100,000km trip to nowhere on a test track
in Emsland, north Germany, it yesterday received the technical all-clear,
backing from senior politicians and the green light from the federal
railways board.
