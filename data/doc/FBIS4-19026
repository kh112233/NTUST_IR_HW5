  [Text] Brussels, April 12 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] 
called on the Rwandan authorities here Tuesday [12 April] to 
seek a political settlement to the tribal was which exploded 
last Thursday. 
  The EU urged the authorities to "safeguard the achievements 
of the Arusha agreements" reached last August -- a programme for 
reconciliation between rival Hutu and Tutsi communities that 
were to lead to free elections by 1995. 
  In a statement, the EU appealed "in the strongest terms for 
the lives of Rwandese and foreign nationals to be protected as 
they work together within Rwanda to safeguard its internal 
peace." 
  It also called for an international commission of inquiry 
into the air crash over Kigali last Wednesday in which Rwandan 
President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundi President Cyprien 
Ntaryamira were killed. 
  The aircraft was reportedly shot down. The crash triggered a 
wave of carnage pitting the majority Hutus against minority 
Tutsis in which many thousands of people have been reported 
killed. 
  The EU also condemned the "appalling assassinations" of 16 
Belgians -- six civilians and 10 members of UN forces in Rwanda 
-- during the violence in Kigali.
