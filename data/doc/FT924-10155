FT  02 NOV 92 / Subsidy sought for waste projects
COMPANIES that generate power from waste are lobbying the Department of
Trade and Industry to grant them a subsidy from the Pounds 1.2bn 'nuclear
levy'.
Four of the UK's biggest waste-to-energy companies last week formed a lobby
group. They are anxious that renewable energy sources should not be
overlooked in the government's energy review.
The Pounds 1.2bn 'nuclear levy', or non-fossil-fuel obligation, is an 11 per
cent tax on electricity generated from oil, gas and coal. It is supposed to
subsidise higher-cost power projects using alternative fuel sources but more
than 90 per cent goes to the nuclear industry.
Two grants have been made for renewable-energy projects but waste-to-energy
companies are pressing for more to enable them to take advantage of changes
in waste management next year.
Local authorities have to contract out many of their waste-management
functions by April 1, giving generators an important opportunity to sign
waste-to-energy contracts.
The generators warn, however, that a subsidy of about Pounds 100m will be
required to enable the projects to operate economically.
Mr Malcolm Chilton, managing director of Mass Energy, a joint venture
between Midlands Electricity and US group American Ref-fuel, said his
company was preparing to bid for contracts with three or four local
authorities. There were more than 20 other projects being discussed around
the UK, but without a subsidy none would be economic.
Between 90 per cent and 95 per cent of the UK's annual household waste of
30m tonnes is disposed of in landfill sites, with only 5 per cent recycled.
Waste-to-energy supporters say modern incinerators produce lower emissions
than decomposing waste, which can contaminate groundwater.
