FT  11 DEC 92 / Ridley speaks out on arms controls
LORD RIDLEY broke his silence on government involvement in the arms trade
yesterday, claiming it was 'easy' for manufacturers to circumvent official
controls if they wanted to do so.
In an article in The Spectator magazine, the former trade and industry
secretary advises Lord Justice Scott in his inquiry into the arms-to-Iraq
affair to consider the facts 'against the background of the true nature of
commercial trading in armaments or oil'.
He emphasises, however, that he could not 'write about the arms-to-Iraq row
in advance of Lord Justice Scott's inquiry'.
Arguing that it would be 'crazy' to put unnecessary impediments in the way
of British exporters, Lord Ridley says manufacturers are 'by no means under
the government's control'. He adds: 'Manufacturers only need an export
licence if they think they might be supplying armaments to a country against
which the government has placed an arms embargo. If an arms manufacturer
wants to do so, it is easy to beat the control.'
On dual-use equipment, he says that requiring an export licence from anyone
who 'thinks he might have an order for something that could be of use in
waging war' leads to 'impossible judgments' having to be made. 'Nor does it
seem unreasonable to 'relax the guidelines' at some times and to tighten
them at others.'
Previously confidential documents released during the trial of three
directors of Matrix Churchill, the machine tool manufacturer, included a
letter sent in June 1990 to the prime minister from Mr Ridley's office
calling for the rationale of government guidelines for defence sales to Iraq
and Iran to be reconsidered.
