FT  04 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP rise checked
The recent strong showing of British Petroleum - the shares have risen from
around 300p since the start of September and came within a whisker of
attaining a two-year high - was halted late yesterday by a burst of overseas
selling pressure ahead of today's third-quarter figures from the UK oil
company.
By the close, BP was 5 1/2 lower at 347p, with turnover of 9m shares said to
have been substantially boosted by the appearance of large blocks of shares
on offer from the US. Oil sector specialists said the US selling
materialised after one of the leading US oil analysts downgraded his 1994
crude oil price forecast to Dollars 18.50 a barrel.
The downgrade, and the subsequent US-sourced selling pressure, caused
widespread concern in London. It was US buying that triggered the upsurge in
BP shares from the 184p level in August 1992. The US buying was accommodated
by heavy selling of BP shares by UK insitutions.
Oil specialists were decidedly nervous about BP shares ahead of the figures.
'Given the rise in the stock lately, the numbers will have to be very good
indeed,' said one. Talk of a possible heavy rights issue was disregarded
around the market, with next spring seen as a more likely time to tap the
market.
Shell Transport performed similarly to BP, easing 3 to 715p, although there
was no evidence of selling from the US. Lasmo dipped 2 1/2 to 137 1/2 p,
with dealers citing the latest decline in crude oil prices rather than
unsubstantiated bear stories as being respon-sible for the latest fall in
the shares.
British Borneo was a feature among the smaller oil stocks, edging up 3 to
217p - its highest level since November 1991 - after the encouraging oil
discovery on Block 21/16 in the North Sea.
BAT Industries slipped 7 to 485p, albeit in rather unspec-tacular turnover
of 2.7m shares, after revealing third-quarter results broadly in line with
market estimates.
Sun Alliance moved up 5 to 373p on heavy turnover of 4.5m, with good buying
from Morgan Stanley said to have been responsible for the performance by the
shares.
Prudential Corp, on the other hand, came under relentless downside pressure
throughout the session after Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, was said
to have lowered its current year profits forecast for the group by Pounds
30m to Pounds 515m, citing increased claims affecting Prudential's M &amp; G
Reinsurance operation. Prudential retreated 7 1/2 to 357 1/2 p on good
turnover of 4.2m shares. The weakness in Prudential spilled over into Legal
&amp; General, which ended 8 cheaper at 510p.
Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, ran up 5 to 221p after the emergence
of persistent US buying of the ADRs.
National Westminster rose 9 to 563p, with Swiss Bank said to have been an
aggressive buyer of the stock.
Drug issues turned the corner and began to recover from their recent
volatile ride, with most stocks staging a rally. They were helped to some
extent by an upgrading in the US by Goldman Sachs of three US companies,
which encouraged flagging sentiment in pharmaceuticals over here.
Wellcome pushed through the sensitive 700p level and closed at 705p - 15 up
on the day. Glaxo jumped 23 to 683p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' added 10 1/2
at 415 1/2 p.
Zeneca, which claimed its Zestril drug benefits heart attack victims, moved
ahead 12 to 768p.
Market belief that a ruling would come today in Medeva's court battle over
the patent for its Hepatitis B vaccine pushed up confidence in the shares.
They advanced 5 to 125p in a turnover of 1.8m. The judgment was expected
later in the month, so sentiment was buoyed by the belief that an early
announcement would indicate a positive one for Medeva.
MB Caradon made further progress, climbing 5 to 341p, with dealers noting a
log-jam of pent-up buying orders following the recent Kleinwort Benson buy
note.
BT 'old' shares rose 7 to 476 1/2 p and the partly-paid 7 1/2 to 227 1/2 p,
the latter in 8.2m volume, ahead of today's second-quarter figures, with
specialists pin-pointing the rate of dividend growth as the key factor in
the shares' performance.
Market pleasure with the results of Marks and Spencer was slightly tempered
by fall-out from the food wars, according to one analyst, who had expected
that the figures would have pushed the share price up more strongly.
The shares appreciated 7 to 403p in good volume after results which forced
many analysts to revise upwards their forecasts.
Good effects from the retailer's results rippled out to the textile sector,
with some market watchers seeing optimism in the supply potential.
Claremont, a main supplier to the high street retailer, strengthened 6 to
353p.
An upgrading by Kleinwort Benson helped Dixons to register a gain of 7 at
273p.
