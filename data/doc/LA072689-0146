BIG 10 COACHES ASK MANDATORY STEROID TESTING 
Big Ten football coaches are calling for mandatory leaguewide testing for 
anabolic steroids, saying it is necessary to assure the health and safety of 
athletes. 
The coaches concluded Tuesday, after a closed meeting in Chicago, that uniform 
testing should be initiated, the Detroit Free Press reported today. 
"It's going to be expensive, but we've got to stamp this thing out," said Bo 
Schembechler, Michigan coach and athletic director. 
Coaches, physicians and trainers plan further studies before adopting any 
formal plans. Any such plan would need approval by university presidents, 
athletic directors and faculty representatives. 
'Quite Feasible' 
Ohio State team doctor Robert Murphy, one of the physicians who proposed 
conference testing in May, made a presentation Tuesday before the coaches. 
"I think the program they outlined is quite feasible," Illinois Coach John 
Mackovic said. "But we're dealing with seven states and state universities. 
Different states and universities have different policies." 
"The important thing is that everybody is testing right now and everyone is in 
favor of a drug-testing program," Michigan State Coach George Perles said. 
"We're diligently working on it to see what can be done." 
Use of anabolic steroids increases a player's size and strength, but side 
effects include liver dysfunction, heart and vascular problems and hair loss.
