FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Decision on Maxwell insurance claim likely
next week
ADMINISTRATORS to the Maxwell empire will have to wait until next Thursday
before hearing whether insurers are likely to pay out under the late Mr
Robert Maxwell's Pounds 20m accident policy.
A report from the loss adjuster, Mr Roger Rich, into the publisher's death
last November says that Mr Maxwell probably committed suicide. 'On the
evidence I have got, the suicide theory is the more compelling one,' Mr Rich
said yesterday.
The report casts the clearest light yet on the last troubled hours Mr
Maxwell spent on board his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine, before his death, that
led to the full exposure of the massive fraud in his business empire.
But it has done little to calm the legal battle that is developing over the
'key man' accidental death insurance policy.
Mr Charles Wilson, editor-in-chief of Mirror Group Newspapers, one of the
Maxwell companies that paid premiums for the policy, said: 'we retain and
are pursuing our interest in the insurance policy on Robert Maxwell's life.'
The insurance companies that have underwritten just over half the risk are
due to meet on Wednesday to decide how to respond to the loss adjuster's
report. Lloyd's and the companies were then expected to approach Maxwell's
brokers.
Mr Rich said should Lloyd's want to use suicide as a reason not to pay out
on the policy, there would have to be proof that Mr Maxwell did indeed
commit suicide.
On the other hand, Mr Pat Slade, underwriter on the leading syndicate,
Sturge, said that if there was no evidence suggesting Mr Maxwell's death was
an accident, he would not expect there to be a claim under the policy.
