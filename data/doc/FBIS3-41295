  Police reported the seizure of 45 kg of cocaine at 2 de Maio 
ranch, 30 km from Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul, and the arrest 
of a Beninese citizen, who confessed that he bought the drug to 
ship it to Nigeria hidden in exhaust pipes. According to 
police, a new route is being used by the Colombian and Bolivian 
cartels to transport the drug through Brazil. The drug enters 
the country at Ponta Pora, then is transported to Dourados, 
where it is hidden in spare parts of cars. The cocaine then 
leaves Mato Grosso do Sul on the main highway to Sao Paulo. 
Police believe that drug traffickers use ELP Trade and Export 
Company, headquartered in Sao Paulo, as a front to export 
cocaine to Nigeria. (Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television in
