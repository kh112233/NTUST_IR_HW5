  [Text] On Jose Eduardo dos Santos' orders, General Jose 
Pedro of the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FAPLA] has been trying to occupy areas under the control of the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in 
Cabinda. He has so far not succeed however because UNITA Armed 
Forces have been vigorously defending their positions. After 
seeing their offensive in the area thwarted, FAPLA troops began 
to direct their murderous wrath against civilians, particularly 
to the north of Buco Zau. Our correspondent Americo Chivala 
reports. 
  [Begin Chivala recording] At 0940 on 11 June, troops 
belonging to the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola 
[MPLA], under the command of Major (Rubula) [words indistinct] 
pitilessly attacked defenseless civilians in the villages of 
Panga and (Nachiede), killing four civilians, wounding over 10 
others, and burning the villages. The MPLA men have intensified 
their looting over the past 48 hours along (Kiuango) River.
