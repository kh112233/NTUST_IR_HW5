HEALTH WATCH; 
UNSAFE SEX 
What do you do when you know with objective certainty that many teen-agers are 
going to have sex -- whether you like it or not, whether religious authorities 
like it or not, whether it is a good thing for them or not? 
And that they're going to have sex at a time when the nation is awash in 
unwanted teen pregnancies? And when the AIDS epidemic is hitting lower-income, 
minority communities with a gale-force vengeance? 
Duck it, right? 
That's what New York City -- the AIDS capital of the nation -- did for years. 
The city Board of Education always voted down proposals to distribute condoms 
in the public high schools (condoms are an inexpensive but relatively effective 
method of reducing the risk of pregnancy and disease). But New York is ducking 
no more. The city board is leaning toward distributing condoms to teen students 
-- despite the sincere and deeply felt opposition of many local religious 
leaders. 
The switch in position was led by Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez, a Latino 
educator in a city whose mayor, David Dinkins, is a black. Said the chancellor: 
"I am a Catholic, but I have to give the best recommendations to (school) board 
members who are faced with the fact that we have been preaching safe sex and no 
sex, and 80% of the kids are sexually active. Then we have to do something 
else." 
Chancellor Fernandez is to be congratulated for his leadership -- and for 
keeping his personal religious beliefs separate from his secular 
responsibilities as a public official.
