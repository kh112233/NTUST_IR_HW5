FT  08 JUN 94 / Dalai Lama urges west to back Tibet
The Dalai Lama, concerned about mounting pressure on him to abandon a policy
of non-violence towards Beijing, appealed to the west yesterday to try to
influence China about the future of Tibet, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Addressing Belgian MPs during a three-day visit to Belgium, the exiled
Tibetan spiritual leader said he had failed so far to get anywhere with
China.
'In Tibet some people think we should use more violent means. This (view)
may even be growing, but I do not think this is the right approach,' the
1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner said. 'I want you to use all of your influence
to make sure that the Chinese government accepts negotiations with the
Tibetans,' he said.
The Dalai Lama has sought talks with Beijing since 1979 when paramount
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said that 'except for the independence of
Tibet, all other questions can be negotiated'. He has proposed that Tibet be
given internal autonomy with China looking after foreign policy and defence.
The Dalai Lama told the MPs he would like to hold a referendum to find out
if non-violence still had support among his followers.
The Dalai Lama said he was not interested in entering politics in Tibet,
pointing out that many Tibetans would have problems accepting a religious
leader as a politician.
