CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
TEACHERS SUPPORT GAS TAX MEASURE 
The California Teachers Assn. has agreed to actively support Proposition 111, a 
June 5 ballot measure that would modify the state's spending limit and increase 
the gas tax. The decision by the 230,000-member organization is a boost for the 
campaign to win voter approval of the tax increase, which would add 9 cents a 
gallon over four years. 
The teachers group had threatened last December to finance a campaign against 
the measure. CTA President Ed Foglia said teachers were concerned that the 
proposed modifications in the spending limit would erase many of the gains 
education won in 1988 with Proposition 98, the school finance initiative. But 
over the weekend Foglia told the group's policy-making body that legislative 
leaders have now agreed to support a bill that would guarantee that "education 
still gets its fair share of the state budget."
