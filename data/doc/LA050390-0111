GOVERNOR VETOES GAS TAX INCREASE 
Gov. Bob Martinez vetoed a $4.7-billion transportation tax hike and 
construction bill as road builders ringed the Capitol with heavy equipment to 
protest his decision. The first-term Republican governor said the bill's 
4-cents-a-gallon gas tax increase was unacceptable. Martinez favors allowing 
local governments to make the tax decision, and he said the Legislature's bill 
allowed the people no voice in imposing the levy.
