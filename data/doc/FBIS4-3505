  [Text] About 100 Hong Kong China-beat journalists have 
joined the boycott of official mainland press tours to show 
their anger over the jailing of Ming Pao journalist Xi Yang. 
  Meanwhile, Beijing yesterday rejected Britain's request for 
clemency for Xi, saying the incident was China's "internal 
affair" and that Xi's 12-year sentence for "spying" and stealing 
state secrets was "appropriate". 
  The protesting China-beat journalists will submit a 
statement 
to the Hong Kong branch of the official XINHUA News Agency, 
China's de facto embassy here, tomorrow. 
  The statement said the journalists were shocked by Xi's 
imprisonment because Xi's reporting style, which was described 
by China as "spying", was similar to theirs. They said they 
were also in danger of being detained. 
  The Chinese government subsidises the press tours. 
  The boycott would last until the end of May, the journalists 
said. 
  The statement also urged the Hong Kong and British 
governments to continue following Xi's case and the Chinese 
authorities to clarify the definition of "state secrets". 
  In Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman, replying to 
British 
Ambassador to China Robin MacLaren's appeal for clemency for Xi, 
said: "The Chinese judicial departments' trial of Xi Yang 
according to law is China's internal affair." 
  The United States has also voiced its concern over Xi's 
jailing.
