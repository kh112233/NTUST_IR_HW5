<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a letter from FDA to Calgene, Inc., notifying
the firm that the agency has concluded that FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes have not been significantly altered when compared to varieties of tomatoes with a history of safe use. FDA
also is announcing the availability of a written summary of the consultation between Calgene and the agency concerning
FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes, which consultation was conducted in accordance with the agency's policy on foods derived from new plant
varieties. FDA is publishing this document to bring to closure the public process that began with a May 1992 notice
announcing a request from Calgene for an advisory opinion concerning FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 


In a letter dated August 12, 1991, Calgene, Inc., requested an advisory opinion under 10.85 (21 CFR 10.85) concerning
whether FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes are food and, therefore, subject to the same regulation as other tomato varieties. In developing the FLAVR
SAVR

TM

 tomato, Calgene used recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques to introduce an antisense polygalacturonase
(PG) gene. The sense PG gene, normally present in tomatoes, encodes the enzyme PG, which is associated with the breakdown
of pectin (a constituent of the cell wall in tomato fruit). The principle underlying the FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato is that the antisense PG gene suppresses the production of the PG enzyme, resulting in ripe fruit that remains
firm for an extended period, which allows fresh market tomatoes to be vine-ripened for enhanced flavor. 



In the 

Federal Register

 of May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22984), FDA issued a policy statement (the 1992 policy statement) that clarifies the agency's
interpretation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) with respect to foods derived from new plant varieties.
On that same date, FDA announced Calgene's advisory opinion request (57 FR 22772), and requested public comment.
FDA believed that such a notice was in the public interest because that request was the first made to FDA regarding the
status of a whole food produced by the new methods of gene transfer. 
In light of the publication of the 1992 policy statement, FDA now believes that the status of a particular product,
such as the FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomato, should be addressed through a consultation with the agency consistent with the principles outlined in that
statement. As a result of that consultation, FDA has notified Calgene, in a letter dated May 17, 1994, that the agency
has concluded that FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes have not been significantly altered when compared to varieties of tomatoes with a history of safe use (21
CFR 170.30(f)(2)). FDA has prepared a written summary of the agency's consultation with Calgene. The written summary
includes a response to the comments received on the Calgene advisory opinion request, including comments contained
in a citizen petition (Docket No. 92P0222/CP1) filed in accordance with 10.30 (21 CFR 10.30).
FDA believes that this notice brings to closure the public process that began with the agency's announcement of Calgene's
advisory opinion request. 
FLAVR SAVR

TM

 tomatoes contain the kanamycin resistance gene (the 

kan



r

 gene) that encodes the enzyme aminoglycoside-3
&rsquo;-phosphotransferase II (APH(3
&rsquo;)II). In the 

Federal Register

 of July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38429), FDA announced that Calgene had filed a food additive petition (FAP 3A4364) proposing
that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of APH(3
&rsquo;)II as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton. Elsewhere
in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is publishing a final rule that amends the agency's food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of APH(3
&rsquo;)II as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton. The agency
evaluated the safety of APH(3
&rsquo;)II in the context of FAP 3A4364 and not as part of the consultation with Calgene that is the subject of this notice.
