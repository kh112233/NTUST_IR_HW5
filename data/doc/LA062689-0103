CANADA HURDLER'S DRUG BUYS TOLD 
Julie Rocheleau-Baumann, Canada's top female hurdler, purchased banned steroids 
and human growth hormone from a Quebec bodybuilder and admitted drug supplier, 
a federal drug inquiry into amateur athletics was told today. 
Benoit Levesque, 29, testified under oath that Rocheleau-Baumann approached him 
last June seeking the drugs, which are used to help athletes build muscle. 
"She thought it was the best way for her of competing without any substances 
being detected on her," said Levesque, who has won numerous Canadian 
bodybuilding titles. 
Rocheleau-Baumann, 25, now living in Switzerland, has refused to appear before 
the Canadian inquiry sparked by the Ben Johnson scandal and denies using drugs. 
She finished sixth in the 100 meters at Seoul but recently failed a random drug 
test instituted by the Canadian Track and Field Assn.
