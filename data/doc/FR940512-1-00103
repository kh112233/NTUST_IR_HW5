 

(2)(i) *** This paragraph is promulgated under 24 CFR 35.24(b)(6) and supersedes, with respect to
the program, the requirements prescribed in 24 CFR part 35, subpart C. The requirements of this paragraph apply only
to structures that will be occupied by children less than six years of age. 


(ii) The following definitions apply to paragraph (d) of this section: 



Chewable surface

 means any intact protruding painted surface up to five feet from the floor or ground that is readily accessible to children
less than six years of age (e.g., protruding corners, windowsills and frames, doors and frames, and other protruding
woodwork). 



Defective paint surface

 means a surface on which the paint is nonintact, i.e., the paint is cracking, scaling, chipping, peeling, or loose.




Elevated blood lead level

 or 

EBL

 means the same as the term is defined in 35.3 of this title.

(iii) *** If defective paint surfaces are found, treatment in accordance with 24 CFR 35.24(b)(4)
is required. *** 

(iv) In the case of a structure constructed or substantially rehabilitated before 1978, if the recipient is presented
with test results that indicate that a child less than six years of age occupies the structure and has an elevated blood
lead level (EBL), the recipient must cause the unit to be tested for lead-based paint on chewable surfaces. Testing
must be conducted by a State or local health or housing agency, by an inspector certified or regulated by a State or local
health or housing agency, or by an organization recognized by HUD. Lead content shall be tested by using an X-ray fluorescence
analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of 1 mg/cm2 or higher shall be considered
positive for the presence of lead-based paint. If the laboratory reports the results in percent by weight, the standard
shall be 0.5 percent or 5,000 parts per million (ppm). Where lead-based paint on chewable surfaces is identified,
covering or removal of the paint surface in accordance with 24 CFR 35.24(b)(4) is required. 

(v) In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraph (d)(2)(iv) of this section, the recipient may, at its discretion,
abate all interior and exterior chewable surfaces in accordance with the methods set out at 24 CFR 35.24(b)(4).
