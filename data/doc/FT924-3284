FT  09 DEC 92 / Plea over 'German foreigners'
THE younger generation of foreigners living in Germany must be given easier
access to citizenship as a means of fully integrating them into German
society, Mrs Cornelia Schmalz-Jakobsen, head of the federal department for
the problems of foreigners, said yesterday.
She said continuing opposition, particularly from the Bavarian-based
Christian Social Union, the sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling
Christian Democratic Union, was holding up any changes to the current
nationality law, as well as the introduction of an immigration law. German
nationality is based on direct German ancestry.
The need to give the younger generation a sense of identity in Germany
coincides with nationwide demonstrations against racism which have been
organised by the country's universities.
They started on Monday, and will last until Friday, the day after Mr Kohl
delivers a special speech to the Bundestag on right-wing extremism and
violence.
His speech, which will be followed by a two-hour debate, is in response to
domestic and international pressure for the government to play a much more
prominent role in combating xenophobia and arson attacks on foreigners.
Yesterday, legal proceedings were started against Mr Thomas Dienel, head of
the far-right National Democratic Party, who allegedly said he regretted
that Germany's younger generation had not killed any Jews.
