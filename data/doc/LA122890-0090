CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SAN FRANCISCO; 
MAYOR SIGNS BILL REGULATING VDTS 
Declaring it the worker safety issue of the 1990s, Mayor Art Agnos signed into 
law the nation's toughest legislation regulating video display terminals. 
Union leaders promised they now will turn the battle for regulation of 
computers in the workplace to the state and federal arenas. Agnos agreed to 
sign the measure after prodding labor and business leaders to compromise on 
amendments that will make the ordinance less costly for businesses and extend 
to four years, from two, the time they would have to comply fully. City Atty. 
Louise Renne said she is "not worried" about possible legal challenges to the 
measure.
