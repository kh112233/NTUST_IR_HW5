FT  09 APR 94 / Russia buys jobs to halt migration
Russia has begun to invest in, or place orders with, plants in former Soviet
states in order to give work to Russians in those states.
The government fears a flood of Russian immigrants from 'the near abroad' as
plants close because of lack of orders and supplies.
Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy premier in charge of regional policy, has
forecast 3m may return from central Asia alone over the next few years, to
add to the 350,000 who have already returned in the past three years.
In Estonia, the giant gas monopoly Gazprom has bought - in competition with
three unnamed western companies - a mineral fertiliser plant in Kohtla
Jarva, a town largely inhabited by Russians. The plant was closed last year
because the price of gas - used in large quantities for its product -
reached near world levels.
Interviewed in the daily Izvestiya, the plant's director, Mr Nikolai
Kutashov, said 1,200 jobs would be restored. He said Gazprom would 'not sell
to us for world prices - but that will allow us to stand on our feet again'.
In Kyrgyzstan Russia is about to place orders with military industrial
plants, according to Mr Osmon Ibraimov, a deputy prime minister.
Speaking to the Russian Information Agency, Mr Ibraimov stressed the main
beneficiaries of the investment would be Russian workers in the plant, and
that the decisions were being made primarily to save their jobs.
Russians are usually over-represented in the workforces of the large
industrial concerns in the former Soviet republics where they make up a
significant part of the population. However, efforts to maintain their jobs
are unlikely to make a significant difference to the migration that is
already under way.
