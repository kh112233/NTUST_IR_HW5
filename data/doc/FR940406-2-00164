 

Successful applicants will be required to work closely with a network of other PHS agencies, including the central
and regional office staffs, Title X service delivery providers, and regional training advisory committees which
provide representation from all service grantees. Successful applicants will be required to review and consider
policy and program goals of the Title X family planning program, solicit advice from the regional training advisory
committee, and consult with Title X service delivery providers about training priorities, course content, and curriculum.
Because of outcomes from the community planning process and emphasis on community involvement, successful applicants
should also stress mechanisms that solicit input from the ``customer,'' both clinician and client.


In developing their curricula and training schedules, general training programs supported under this announcement
should be sensitive to the importance of supporting the program priorities of the Title X services program, which
include:

&bull;Expansion of current clinic sites and development of new clinics in high need areas;


&bull;Outreach to low-income women, adolescents and persons at high risk of unintended pregnancy or infection with
STD (including HIV) not now receiving family planning services;


&bull;Increased emphasis on services to adolescents, including enhanced counseling as well as new service arrangements
for providing services to teens;


&bull;Increased focus on quality and comprehensiveness of services, including treatment of STD's, screening for
cervical cancer and prevention of breast cancer, substance abuse counseling, and counseling on avoidance of high
risk behavior which may place clients at risk for STD and HIV, and


&bull;Increased emphasis on training and retention of Family Planning nurse practitioners, particularly minority
nurse practitioners and those working in clinics serving high risk populations.


Training programs should also be sensitive to the need to focus training on emerging priorities, such as the revised
Title X Guidelines (when issued), the requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act, health care reform, changes
in delivery of traditional family planning in nontraditional sites and program data reporting requirements currently
under revision.


The application should set out how the general training program will address the national health objectives relating
to family planning that are discussed in section 5 of the PHS document, Healthy People 2000. In the context of Healthy
People 2000, attention should be given to training which would enable trainees to: Work more effectively to reduce
teen pregnancy; reduce unintended pregnancy among all women; reduce the initiation of sexual activity by teenagers;
increase the effectiveness of contraception, including barrier contraception, among all women; implement pre-conception
care; and reduce sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.


Successful applicants will be responsible for the overall management of a general training program within the geographic
area for which the grant is made. This responsibility includes:


&bull;Developing an annual training plan, which reflects national and regional goals and the training needs of local
Title X service grantees;


&bull;Developing criteria for selection of staff for training, including prerequisite qualifications. Such criteria
should reflect a sensitivity to the unique needs of grantees for certain types of training, priority for trainees
serving rural areas or Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs), or other relevant factors;


&bull;Developing a process to review training applications submitted by Title X services grantee personnel. Training
grantees will make the final decision about candidates' suitability for training, applying the criteria discussed
above;
