NAMES IN THE NEWS; 
KHASHOGGI'S CONNECTIONS PROVED 
Any doubt that Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi mixes with the rich and famous 
was dispelled Wednesday when one of his personal phone books was admitted into 
evidence at his fraud trial. 
Entries in the loose-leaf book included politicians, entertainers, athletes, 
business figures and apparently Leona Helmsley. 
Among the politicians: former Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter; 
former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger; and Robert C. McFarlane, the 
former national security adviser under President Reagan. 
Actors and entertainers included Christopher Reeve, Farrah Fawcett, Liza 
Minnelli, Paul Anka, Wayne Newton and Brooke Shields. Also listed was George 
Hamilton, a close friend of Khashoggi's co-defendant, Imelda Marcos, who 
earlier testified at the trial. 
The book also held phone numbers for Muhammad Ali, Chrysler Chairman Lee A. 
Iaccoca and a "Mrs. Helmsely," an apparent reference to hotel queen Leona 
Helmsley, who was convicted of tax evasion last year in the same Manhattan 
federal courtroom where Khashoggi and Mrs. Marcos are being tried.
