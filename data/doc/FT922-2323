FT  17 JUN 92 / Observer: Battle scarred
First Beirut and now the Falklands. What, it may be asked, has David Tatham,
Britain's ambassador in Beirut during last year's hostage releases, has done
to deserve the Falkland Islands' governorship?
The answer is that Tatham seems to be a one of a small but growing band of
Foreign Office folk who, believe it or not, are keen on the place. Before
Beirut, Tatham headed the Falkland Islands' department at the Foreign
Office, responsible for not only the islands but also Argentina. The
department was set up after the 1982 Anglo-Argentine war over the islands,
and closed when diplomatic ties were renewed in 1990.
Clearly the FO feels that the sensitivities of 2,000 sheep farmers bear
striking similarity to the byzantine world of Middle East affairs. Tatham is
taking over from William Fullerton, who is off to be our man in Kuwait.
Fullerton, leaving his cat Jason behind, says he is very sad to be
departing.
