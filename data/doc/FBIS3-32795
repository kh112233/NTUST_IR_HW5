  [Text] A regrettable railroad accident occured this morning 
in Remedios, Villa Clara Province. 
  [Journalist Boris Fuentes] "Four dead and 64 injured was the 
toll of a train accident that occurred at 0740 on 13 February, 
when a bridge at a place known as Tahon suffered damage. Tahon 
is part of Remedios Municipality. The train consisted of seven 
cars and two locomotives, and was covering the Santa 
Clara/Moron/Nuevitas route for the northern line. 
  The dead are: Luis Garcia Sanchez, from Sancti Spiritus 
Province; Felix Aguila Morales, from Remedios; Pedro Antonio 
Gomez Alonso, from Santa Clara; and Alberto Munoz Alvarez, from 
Placetas. 
  Shortly after the event, Cuban Communist Party and 
Government 
authorities and a group of experts appeared in person at the 
site to investigate the causes of the accident. 
  One of the most direct sources of the events is the train's 
driver, Manuel Rodriguez." 
  [Rodriguez] "When... [rephrases] accident... [rephrases] 
upon 
going over the bridge, the locomotive that was in front gave a 
leap [bachon], and the train broke in two. I had pulled the 
emergency (?brake) there. I... [rephrases] It was the bridge 
that was the cause of..."[breaks off, interrupted by 
unidentified journalist] 
  [Journalist] "How fast were you going?" 
  [Rodriguez] "Forty, forty-five...."[voice trails off] 
  [Journalist] "Was that permissible, on this track?" 
  [Rodriguez] "No. Sixty." 
  [Fuentes] The director of the Central Cuba division of Cuban 
Railways [Ferrocarriles de Cuba] also comments on what has 
happened." 
  [Director] "It looks like the bridge has been affected, and 
an investigation must be conducted to see if some element in the 
bridge failed, or whether there was another, as yet unknown 
cause. A definitive cause has not yet been found." 
  [Fuentes] Thirty-one people are currently in Villa Clara 
hospitals, nine of them seriously injured, another nine with 
slight injuries, and 13 under observation. The province's 
Defense Council has announced that a ministerial commission that 
will conduct a thorough investigation into the causes of the 
accident has already been created. 
  "This is a Boris Fuentes report from Villa Clara." 
  We learned just a few minutes ago that one more person has 
died: Olga Hernandez, from Zulueta, Villa Clara Province.
