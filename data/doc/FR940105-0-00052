Final rule.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is revoking a regulation that implements section 403(d) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) by defining the circumstances in which a food is misbranded, and that became final
by operation of law on May 10, 1993. In addition, the agency is replacing this revoked regulation with one that was included
in a final rule that published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64123).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) (Pub. L. 101535) became law on November
8, 1990. Section 6 of the 1990 amendments established a procedure under which FDA was given 30 months from the date of
their enactment to promulgate final rules implementing that section. Pursuant to that procedure, FDA published
a proposal on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2957) (the misleading container proposal), to amend its regulations by implementing
new 100.100 (21 CFR 100.100) to define the circumstances in which a food is misbranded under section 403(d)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(d)).


Section 6(b)(3)(D)(ii) of the 1990 amendments provides that, if the final rule to implement section 403(d) of the
act is not promulgated within 30 months of the date of passage of the 1990 amendments (November 8, 1990), then the regulation
proposed to implement that section is to be considered a final regulation. Further, section 6 provides that States
and their political subdivisions shall be preempted with respect to section 403(d) of the act at that time.
The 30-month period established by the 1990 amendments expired on May 9, 1993. Because FDA was unable to publish a final
rule, in the proceeding instituted in January 1993, by May 9, 1993, FDA published a document in the 

Federal Register

 of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 27932) (the May 12, 1993, regulation), announcing that the regulation that FDA had proposed in
the misleading container proposal was considered to be a final regulation by operation of law, effective May 10, 1993.
This document did not conclude the rulemaking begun in January, 1993, however. Rather, the May 12, 1993, regulation
was part of a separate proceeding that is compelled under section 6(b)(3)(D)(ii) of the 1990 amendments (see H. Rept.
101538, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 18 and 136 Congressional Record 5842 on the effect of this ``hammer'' provision).
In the 

Federal Register

 of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64123), FDA published a final rule on the circumstances in which containers are misleading
and thus would misbrand the food under section 403(d) of the act. This final rule concluded the proceeding that the
agency instituted with the misleading container proposal. In the May 12, 1993, document, FDA stated that when it issued
such a final rule, it would act to supersede the regulation that had become final by operation of law. Thus, the agency
proposed to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation in the 

Federal Register

 of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64208).
FDA explained that it was proposing to do so for two reasons. First, the May 10, 1993, regulation did not have the benefit
of public comment. Thus, the regulation included in the December 6, 1993, final rule (the December 6, 1993 regulation),
which was the product of notice and comment rulemaking, is better able than the May 10, 1993, regulation to ensure adequate
implementation of section 403(d) of the act and to facilitate compliance. Second, FDA tentatively found that because
of the minor differences between the May 10, 1993, regulation and the December 6, 1993, regulation, replacing the
former with the latter will not result in any hardship to manufacturers who have relied on the May 10, 1993, regulation.
FDA gave interested persons 10 days to comment on its proposal to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation. It also proposed
to make any final rule that issues in this proceeding effective on the date of its publication in order to ensure that
the supersession of the May 10, 1993, regulation proceeded as expeditiously as possible and with a minimum of confusion
or ambiguity.
The comment period on the proposal to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation closed on December 17, 1993. FDA received
no comments on this proposed action. Therefore, FDA advises that the May 10, 1993, regulation, which became final
by operation of law, is withdrawn. FDA advises that it is replacing that regulation with the December 6, 1993, regulation.



Environmental Impact


In the December 6, 1993, proposal (58 FR 64208 at 64209), FDA stated that it had determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(ii)
that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment,
and that as a result, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. FDA
received no comments on the conclusion; therefore FDA restates it here.


Economic Impact


In the December 6, 1993, proposal (58 FR 64208 at 64209), FDA incorporated the conclusion from the December 6, 1993,
final rule on slack-fill that the agency's action in replacing the May 10, 1993, regulation would not have any significant
economic effects. The agency received no comments on this conclusion and consequently is restating it here.


List of Subject in 21 CFR Part 100

Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs, 21 CFR part 100 is amended as follows:


PART 100_GENERAL


1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 100 continues to read as follows:





Authority: 

Secs. 201, 301, 307, 402, 403, 409, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 331, 337, 342, 343,
348, 371).



100.100 

[Removed]


2. Subpart F consisting of 100.100 

Misleading containers

 (as published in the 

Federal Register

 of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 27932), is removed.
3. For the convenience of the reader, FDA is republishing without change new subpart F, consisting of 100.100
(as published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64136) to read as follows:


Subpart F_Misbranding for Reasons Other Than Labeling


100.100 

Misleading containers.


In accordance with section 403(d) of the act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its container is so made, formed,
or filled as to be misleading. 
(a) A container that does not allow the consumer to fully view its contents shall be considered to be filled as to be misleading
if it contains nonfunctional slack-fill. Slack-fill is the difference between the actual capacity of a container
and the volume of product contained therein. Nonfunctional slack-fill is the empty space in a package that is filled
to less than its capacity for reasons other than:
(1) Protection of the contents of the package;
(2) The requirements of the machines used for enclosing the contents in such package;
(3) Unavoidable product settling during shipping and handling;
(4) The need for the package to perform a specific function (e.g., where packaging plays a role in the preparation or
consumption of a food), where such function is inherent to the nature of the food and is clearly communicated to consumers;
(5) The fact that the product consists of a food packaged in a reusable container where the container is part of the presentation
of the food and has value which is both significant in proportion to the value of the product and independent of its function
to hold the food, e.g., a gift product consisting of a food or foods combined with a container that is intended for further
use after the food is consumed; or durable commemorative or promotional packages; or
(6) Inability to increase level of fill or to further reduce the size of the package (e.g., where some minimum package
size is necessary to accommodate required food labeling (excluding any vignettes or other nonmandatory designs
or label information), discourage pilfering, facilitate handling, or accommodate tamper-resistant devices).
(b) [Reserved]
