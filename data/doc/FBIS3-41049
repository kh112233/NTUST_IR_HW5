  [Text] By 17 November 1993, 603 tanks, 630 armored fighting 
vehicles, and 175 planes had been liquidated in Ukraine. In 
this period, more than 50 groups of inspectors from countries 
who are members of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in 
Europe visited Ukraine. Since the beginning of this year, four 
international groups of inspectors have been in Ukraine and they 
visited the Lvov, Nikolayev, Kiev, and Zhitomir armored 
factories. One hundred tanks and 60 armored fighting vehicles 
will soon be destroyed at these factories. It is planned that 
more than 600 tanks and over 300 armored fighting vehicles will 
be destroyed during the new period of reductions in Ukraine's 
Armed Forces.
