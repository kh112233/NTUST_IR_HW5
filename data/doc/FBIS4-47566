  [Abstract] Metabolic monitoring was performed on 20 
children, boys and girls 8-12 years old, in the Brest Olast 
exposed to elevated backround levels of Cs and Sr radionuclides. 
Urinary levels of Cs ranged from 20 to 400 Bq/L and of Sr from 
0.003 to 0.3 Bq/L; 18 of the children presented with euthyroid 
hyperplasia, 15 with generalized gastrointestinal disorders, and 
6 with chronic gastritis in remission. Clinical chemistries 
revelated positive, significant (p less than 0.05) correlation 
coefficients between elevated plasma levels of malonic 
dialdehyde and plasma and erythrocyte levels of lipid peroxides 
and urinary Sr and Cs concentrations. The patient cohort also 
presented with depressed erythrocyte catalase (p less than 0.05), 
superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (p less than 
0.05) 
activities. In conjunction with other factors reflecting energy 
metabolism, the findings were consistent with an interpretation 
that increased exposure to the radionuclides entailed activation 
of lipid peroxidation and compromised antioxidant mechanisms. 
Accordingly, therapeutic measures in such at-risk children 
should be directed at stimulation of tissue respiration, 
correction of acidotic shifts and control of lipid peroxidation 
to alleviate cell membrane damage. Tables 2; references 6: 5
