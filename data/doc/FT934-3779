FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (8): Not like the old days - Tourism
industry / facing a shift in fortunes / These are difficult times for many
Bangkok hoteliers
The general manager of the venerable Oriental Hotel, Mr Kurt Wachtveitl,
sent his staff a private notice this summer warning them this was the worst
season of his 25 years at the hotel.
'Room rates are falling every week and the competition is getting fiercer
and fiercer,' he wrote.
Although the dapper Austrian's hotel is sometimes voted the best in the
world, he was forced to remind staff to treasure customers as never before
to prevent them sloping off to one of the Oriental's rivals.
'We simply cannot afford an unhappy client. Once clients know that our
business is down, they will become more demanding, seeking discounts,
wanting more service, pampering and better facilities.'
The Oriental, like all Bangkok hotels, has been hit by the global recession;
much sharper competition from regional rivals like Malaysia, Indonesia and
China; a rapid increase in the number of hotel rooms and, critically, by the
fact that Thailand has lost some of its appeal as a tourist destination.
Thailand's luck this year - a dramatic surge in Asian tourist arrivals  -
hardly compensates for plans laid during the days of high-spending
foreigners.
Mr Vinai Ruenjaruwatana, the head of Sunshine Tours and the chairman of the
Phuket chamber's tourism committee, said: 'Don't be fooled by all this
activity - that's only been achieved by cutting rates to the bone. We're
filling hotels with 'low quality' tourists who don't spend money and wreck
the rooms.'
This is a far cry from the late 1980s when - helped by a highly successful
'Visit Thailand Year' promotion in 1987 - hoteliers could give out rooms
like prizes. Mr Vichit na Ranong, owner-manger of the Pearl Village Resort
Hotel in Phuket and president of the Phuket Hotel Owners' Association,
remembers that in those days 'agents were so desperate to find accommodation
they said, 'just get me the rooms - we'll sort out the price later'.
Wonderful.'
The tourist industry in Thailand soared in the second half of the 1980s when
Thailand - helped by a longish stretch of political stability and the 1987
promotion - suddenly became a favoured exotic holiday destination. There
were double digit increases in annual tourist arrivals from 1986 to 1990,
with an almost 24 per cent jump in visitors in 1987 alone.
Although a record 5.3m arrivals were recorded in 1990 the dramatic growth
was already starting to tail off before the traumatic double blow of the
Gulf War and a military coup in 1991. Arrivals dropped by four per cent in
1991 and then rose a sluggish 0.97 per cent in 1992. Thailand's political
crisis reached a climax in May 1992 when troops gunned down pro-democracy
protesters on the streets of Bangkok.
A 16 per cent pick-up over the first seven months of this year prompts Mr
Bert van Walbeck, executive vice president of Bangkok tour operator Siam
Express, to say: 'Thailand could become for Asia what Spain became for
Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. In five or 10 years' time the office lady in
Shanghai will start taking holidays just as her equivalent in Stockholm did
20 or 30 years ago.'
Nearly 60 per cent of arrivals between January and July this year were from
east Asia, notably Taiwan and Korea. Chinese tourists rose a remarkable 231
per cent to 176,085 - only 5.35 per cent of the total. A pointer perhaps to
the future, but hardly a big boost to revenues this year.
With hindsight it was in the glory days of Thai tourism that the seeds of
the industry's current troubles were sown as eager entrepreneurs
over-developed Thai resorts, trying to turn Thailand into an amusement
arcade and thereby destroying the very qualities that attract visitors.
The fishing village of Pattaya on the east coast has in two decades been
turned into a huge brothel fronting onto a polluted sea - thanks partly to
the machinations of a local mafia.
Phuket island's virgin beaches and turquoise seas off southern Thailand's
west coast were the stuff of dreams - until a decade-and-a-half of feverish
hotel building encouraged international passenger jets to land at regular
intervals at the newly expanded airport.
The expression on the face of a local chemist who is also secretary-general
of the Phuket Environmental Protection Association, Mr Vinai Ruenjaruwatana,
would make a good illustration for the wry T-shirt slogan 'Another
(expletive deleted) Day in Paradise.'
'Phuket is skirting disaster. If I wasn't born here, I would move,' he says.
Myriad bars, cafes and guest houses proliferated in the shadow of Thailand's
big hotels as every man and his dog tried to take money from tourists.
When the merry-go-round stopped, Thailand found it had priced itself out of
the market for many European, north American and Japanese tourists. Yet many
investors are blithely continuing to build as if the last two years were a
minor hiccup, prompting the suspicion that many new hotels must count as
'vanity investments' constructed to enhance the owner's prestige rather than
merely to make money.
In Bangkok, the number of hotel rooms will grow by around 20 per cent in
1993 alone, helping to bring expected occupancy rates down from 53.22 per
cent in 1992 to an estimated 48.65 per cent in 1993, compared with 88 per
cent occupancy during the 1988 peak, according to Peregrine Brokerage.
Not every hotel owner is thinking of jumping from the panorama view deck:
tourists are increasingly avoiding Bangkok or Pattaya by flying directly
into such locations as the northern capital Chiang Mai and Phuket as the
rest of Thailand is 'discovered.'
Phuket occupancy rates were 38-59 per cent in 1992 when the number of rooms
increased by 16.4 per cent, yet the degradation of Phuket, and other
upcountry destinations, remains well behind Bangkok or Pattaya. There was a
106 per cent jump in arrivals in 1992 when 1.2m people visited the island
and stayed for, an unusually long average of 10.89 days.
