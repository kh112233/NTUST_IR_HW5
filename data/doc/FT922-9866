FT  05 MAY 92 / Argentina seeks US fighter aircraft
Argentina has said it wants to take up an offer by the US government to sell
its fighter aircraft, ending the arms embargo clamped on Argentina by
Britain and the US after the Falklands conflict 10 years ago.
The American A4M Skyhawks would replace aircraft Argentina lost in 1982.
On Friday, Brigadier Jose Julia, air force commander, announced his
'absolute conviction that before the end of the year we will see in our
skies more, and better combat aircraft, which will replace those that remain
forever in the South Atlantic.'
US officials played down the importance of the proposed sale. First, they
note the Skyhawks are obsolete, although the models being offered Argentina
are the 'Cadillac' of the Skyhawk line. Secondly, they will not be supplied
with weapons systems. Thirdly, Argentina would have to pay for them.
Previous deliveries of non-lethal American military equipment were either
financed or given away.
There is no agreement on the number of Skyhawks Argentina would buy.
American officials would only say Brig Julia's figure of 40 aircraft was
exaggerated.
One official added that Washington wanted to encourage the air force to
reduce its 'mishmash' of French, Israeli and American aircraft in favour of
US aircraft. The Argentines already fly Skyhawks, which played an important
role in the Falklands.
Britain reacted with equanimity, emphasising that Washington had discussed a
possible sale with London. An official explained that the time was coming
when Britain would have to accept that Argentina would upgrade its severely
depleted arsenal. Resisting this would feed resentment and instability in
the armed forces.
Still, he doubted the underfunded air force could afford the aircraft, which
would cost about Dollars 1.75m (Pounds 980,000) each.
