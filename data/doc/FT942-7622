FT  25 MAY 94 / Stampede kills 200 pilgrims
About 200 Moslems have died in a stampede during the annual haj pilgrimage
to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, Reuter reports from Dubai.
The deaths occurred on Monday during a ritual in which pilgrims go to Mina,
15km from Mecca, to throw stones at three piles of rocks which symbolise the
devil. It was not clear what triggered the stampede. Most victims were said
to be from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Africa.
The official Saudi press agency quoted the Ministry of Health as saying 829
pilgrims had died during the haj of old age, heart ailments and other
causes, including an unspecified number killed by 'intense crowding'.
This year's haj has also seen confrontations between the Saudi authorities,
who ban all political activity at the pilgrimage, and Iranians determined to
hold political rallies.
