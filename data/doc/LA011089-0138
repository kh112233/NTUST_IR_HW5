LOCAL; 
SUSPECT FLEES SANTA ANA POLICE 
A robbery suspect who could not elude a police dog managed to escape from his 
human captors this morning during treatment for dog bite wounds at a Santa Ana 
hospital, Santa Ana police said. 
The suspect, Eric Moore, had been captured under a house on West Cubbon Street 
by a police dog Monday after Alfredo Torrez, 36, flagged down officers and said 
two men had taken his wallet and two gold rings, police spokeswoman Maureen 
Thomas said. 
Moore, who was bitten several times in the capture, was taken to Western 
Medical Center at about 4:30 a.m. and then disappeared. 
"We're investigating how he got away," Thomas said. "Some of our officers were 
present, but he managed to escape at some point when being examined for his 
bite injuries." 
A 17-year-old boy arrested with Moore also was treated for dog bite wounds and 
taken to Juvenile Hall.
