  [Excerpt] AL-MUHARRIR has learned that in the next few days 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak will undertake a shuttle trip 
to the Gulf to remove the causes of tension between Qatar and 
Bahrain. The tour will take place in light of the military 
concentrations which threatens a confrontation between the two 
countries over the Islands of Hawar and Fasht al-Dibal. The two 
states have moved artillery and missile batteries toward the 
disputed areas. Mubarak's urgent contacts with the two states 
helped ease the tension and have postponed any clashes. 
  The Egyptian Foreign Ministry has received an urgent report 
on the developments of the crisis, as well as documents the two 
sides presented to the International Court of Justice, which has 
been examining the dispute since November 1992. The report says 
that the recent escalation resulted from the struggle among 
foreign companies prospecting for oil in the disputed areas.
