4 KILLED, 2 HURT WHEN TRAINS CRASH IN CORONA 
Four railway crew members were killed and two others were injured this morning 
when two freight trains collided before dawn, igniting a brief, spectacular 
inferno, according to authorities and eyewitnesses. 
Michael A. Martin, a spokesman for the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway 
Co., declined to immediately identify the dead, pending notification of their 
families. 
The deaths occurred about 4:10 a.m. when a Chicago-bound freight train collided 
with another headed from Barstow to Los Angeles, according to Martin. The 
entire crew of the westbound train -- an engineer, a conductor and a brakeman 
-- died. On the eastbound train, the brakeman was killed, Martin said. 
The two crew members of the eastbound train who survived were taken to area 
hospitals with injuries that Martin described as less than life-threatening. 
James Dawson, 50, was in fair condition with a fractured knee and head 
lacerations at Riverside General Hospital, nursing supervisor Jane Dolan said. 
Warren Sanders, whose age was not disclosed immediately, was in good condition 
with a fractured ankle at Corona Community Hospital, according to nursing 
supervisor Kathy Stephens. 
Martin, the railway spokesman, said the cause of the accident was under 
investigation. Four locomotives and at least six freight cars derailed. Both 
trains were operated by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe company. 
For reasons that Martin said were not yet known, the westbound train, weighing 
8,700 tons and stretching 6,094 feet long, apparently moved forward from a side 
track, its lead locomotive striking the eastbound train near the front of its 
second engine. 
The eastbound train, which Martin estimated was traveling up to 65 m.p.h., had 
three locomotives, weighed 3,152 tons, was 4,229 feet long and was composed of 
box cars, tank cars, hopper cars and empty automobile carriers.
