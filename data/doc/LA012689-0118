PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS OFTEN MISUSED IN REST HOMES, SURVEY CONCLUDES 
Powerful tranquilizers that can cause dangerous side effects are being given to 
elderly people in rest homes, often by untrained aides without medical 
supervision, a Massachusetts study found. 
Such drugs are available only with a doctor's prescription, but many rest home 
residents continue to be given them months or years after a medical 
examination, the principal author of the report said Wednesday. 
"It may well be that when they first started getting the stuff they needed it," 
said Dr. Jerry Avorn of the Beth Israel Hospital and Harvard Medical School in 
Boston. "It may be that some people still need it," he said, but without 
follow-up exams there is no assurance that a drug is being used properly. 
Medications such as Thorazine and Haldol, designed for treatment of psychotics, 
can cause tardive dyskinesia, a disfiguring and sometimes irreversible side 
effect of uncontrollable facial twitches, he said. 
Avorn said that use of such drugs is not being limited to treatment of 
psychoses. 
"Sometimes they are used as sedatives, and that's not a good idea, because they 
will have side effects that outweigh their advantages," he said. 
Too large a dose of a psychiatric drug also can aggravate confusion or 
lethargy, thereby increasing the risk that patients will fall and injure 
themselves, Avorn said. 
Avorn, with Stephen B. Soumerai of Harvard and Paul Dreyer and Kathleen 
Connelly of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, surveyed 55 rest 
homes in the state. The institutions care for elderly people who are not sick 
enough to be in nursing homes but are too frail to live on their own, Avorn 
said. 
The findings were published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
