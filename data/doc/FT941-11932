FT  02 FEB 94 / Lockerbie damages awards are upheld
A US federal appeals court has upheld jury awards to three relatives of
people killed aboard PanAm Flight 103, the airliner downed by a terrorist
bomb above Lockerbie, Scotland, AP reports from New York.
The ruling on Monday could result in the bankrupt but insured US airline
paying out hundreds of millions of dollars on 222 other claims.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit voted 2 to 1 to uphold damages
totalling nearly Dollars 19m (Pounds 12.6m), awarded in 1992 by a district
court jury in Brooklyn. The jury found that Pan American World Airways
failed to prevent the bomb from being placed aboard the aircraft.
The 1988 explosion killed 270 people.
The US and Britain are still seeking the extradition of two Libyan
intelligence officials accused of being behind the bombing.
