TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL; 
BACKERS OF PROPOSITION M TAX HIKE OUTNUMBER FOES 
With only days to go before a countywide vote on a proposed half-cent sales tax 
increase for transportation projects, The Times Orange County Poll shows 
supporters outnumbering opponents by 15% but still lacking a solid majority to 
carry the measure. 
In a telephone survey of 600 registered voters, 47% said they would vote yes on 
Measure M on Nov. 7, while just 32% said they would vote no -- down 14 points 
from the 46% who said they opposed the tax increase in a previous Times Orange 
County Poll in July. 
But while opposition to Measure M has softened, support has remained flat, 
actually dropping a point since July. The percentage of undecided voters, 
however, has jumped from 6% to 21%, according to the poll. 
The random-sample poll was conducted by Irvine-based Mark Baldassare &amp; 
Associates from Oct. 23 through Oct. 25. The margin of error is 4% for 
questions involving all 600 people sampled and somewhat larger for questions of 
smaller groups. 
Baldassare said the large increase in the number of undecided voters was 
unusual and made the outcome of the election particularly difficult to predict. 
"If anything, as the vote is getting closer, one would expect that people would 
swing in one direction or another," Baldassare said. "I think it is 
significant, but it doesn't really give us a clue as to how it's going to end 
up." 
According to Baldassare, the latest poll shows that there are a "couple of 
critical issues" that are key to the success or failure of Measure M, which 
would increase the sales tax from 6 to 6 1/2%. 
"The issue of turnout and the issue of what those undecideds will decide once 
they listen to the arguments . . . whether they believe the money would be 
spent wisely," he said. 
Asked how much confidence they had in county government's ability to spend the 
sales tax money wisely, 40% of poll respondents answered that they had "none" 
or "hardly any"; only one in four voters among this group supports the 
half-cent increase. 
Just 18% of those surveyed said they had "a great deal" of confidence in county 
government. 
Perhaps most troubling for Measure M proponents are the figures for those 
voters most likely to show up at the polls Nov. 7. Just 33% of voters who are 
"highly likely" to vote -- about 100 of the 600 surveyed -- said they would 
support the measure, while 46% of those opposed it. Voters who are "somewhat 
likely" to go to the polls, however -- a group twice as large as the "highly 
likelies" -- favored the measure by a margin of 52% to 29%. 
"The greater the turnout, the more likely this is to pass," Baldassare said. 
Opponents of Measure M say it will fail at the polls if turnout stays below 
25%. But both sides agree that if turnout approaches 30%, the measure should 
capture the majority of additional voters and would have a good chance of 
passing. 
Turnout at off-year elections in Orange County is normally just 10% to 12%, 
county Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney said, but he would make no 
prediction on this year's turnout. The presence of a countywide measure on an 
issue as important to voters as transportation will bring more voters to the 
polls, but Tanney said he has no recent precedents to help him make an 
estimate. 
The proposed half-cent sales tax increase would raise $3.1 billion for an 
$11.5-billion, 20-year traffic improvement and growth management plan, with the 
remaining $8.4 billion coming from the state and federal government, as well as 
other sources. The creation of a citizen's committee to oversee disbursement of 
the money helped win the support of some traditional opponents of development 
and tax increases. 
Without the increase, proponents of the measure say, the county will not be 
able to pay for sorely needed transportation projects such as freeway widening, 
a commuter rail system, more car-pool lanes and so-called "super streets" to 
reduce congestion. 
Opponents of the measure contend that the transportation improvements will only 
foster more growth and that taxes are already high enough. 
A proposed one-cent sales tax increase for unspecified transportation projects 
was decisively rejected by Orange County voters in June, 1984. But Baldassare 
said this time around, residents seem to be more inclined to at least consider 
the merits of the measure. 
"I think in '84 at this time (before Election Day), the movement was toward the 
'No' column. So I think it's quite a different set of circumstances," he said. 
"It's a different kind of plan . . . a very complex package. . . . I think that 
it means that there's been some willingness to listen to what the plan is all 
about and not reject a tax increase outright." 
Bruce Nestande, a member of the state Transportation Commission and chairman of 
Citizens for Yes on Measure M, said the softening of opposition was a sign that 
the committee's $1.8-million campaign is getting its message out effectively. 
"As the campaign moves closer to closure, your noes drift away to undecided and 
then you bring them over to our side," Nestande said. "We have to show a 
cost-benefit assortment of projects that would satisfy the residents. . . . We 
accept the responsibility to do that." 
However, Jerry Yudelson, one of the leaders of the No on M committee, 
interpreted the poll results as "a danger sign" for Measure M backers. 
"Even with $1.2 million, they haven't been able to go over 50% (supporting the 
measure)," said Yudelson, a Garden Grove businessman. "I think in the last week 
or two, you'll see the pendulum swing back our way." 
The measure's opponents are counting on Orange County's traditional aversion to 
taxes and its history of poor turnouts in off-year elections to bring them 
victory. 
The Times Orange County Poll found that almost half the undecided respondents 
-- 44% -- said they would not be willing to pay any new taxes for 
transportation. Another 28% said they would be most willing to support an 
increase in the gasoline tax for road projects. A proposed statewide gasoline 
tax increase will be on the June ballot next year for statewide projects. 
But, Baldassare pointed out, M supporters could look with optimism at the fact 
that almost six in 10 of the undecided group said they could support some kind 
of tax or fee for transportation improvements. 
"That group could decide the election," Baldassare said. 
One poll respondent who is undecided on the measure said she could support the 
half-cent sales tax if she knew more about how the money would be spent. 
"A lot of time what they do is use the money for the center dividers, they 
plant trees, flowers and grass," said Chelenne Lunde, 18, of Buena Park. "If it 
goes toward fixing the streets, then I would be for it. . . . But I haven't 
heard much about it." 
Anaheim resident Lewis Rose said he was having a hard time making up his mind 
because he had disliked past proposals for tax increases -- particularly 
Proposition A, the one-cent sales tax increase for transportation in 1984. 
"It's like crying wolf," said Rose, 33. Still, he agreed that solutions had to 
be found to the traffic problems in Orange County. 
Waldene Curtis of El Toro said she supports the measure "because I'm kind of 
fed up with the traffic congestion down here. I'm assuming that it will 
alleviate some of that. . . . What used to take 20 minutes now takes 45 
minutes." 
But Curtis said she remains concerned that the transportation projects would 
foster more development and is skeptical about the measure's growth management 
plan. "I'm sure it takes a second seat to the other elements," she said. 
Surprisingly, the level of frustration over traffic does not appear to be 
closely linked with support for Measure M. 
Even among those surveyed who said they were "extremely upset" by driving 
conditions in Orange County, the measure was favored by just 49% -- about the 
same as among respondents who said they were "very upset" or just "moderately 
upset." 
The measure's strongest support appeared to be in South County, where it was 
favored by 51% of the poll respondents, compared to 45% in North County. 
Opponents of the measure have said they hope to exploit the geographical 
difference with campaign literature aimed at North County voters that portrays 
Measure M as a boondoggle for South County developers at their expense. 
The poll also found that men are more likely to favor Measure M than women and 
that its support increases among younger, more affluent voters. Respondents 
earning less than $20,000 oppose the measure by 43% to 33%. Those who earn more 
than $60,000, however, support it, with 53% in favor and 29% opposed.

"Measure M would raise the sales tax one-half cent -- from 6 cents to 6 1/2 
cents -- for 20 years, with the funds to be used solely for transportation 
construction and growth management programs. If the election were held today, 
would you vote yes or no on Measure M?"
