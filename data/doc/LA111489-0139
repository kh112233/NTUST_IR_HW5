EX-BANK HEAD PLEADS GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY 
A former Tustin bank president pleaded guilty Monday to one count of conspiracy 
for giving phony credit information to five Las Vegas casinos so they would 
approve credit lines for several alleged organized crime figures. 
Roger McGinnis, 52, of Orange, admitted in U.S. District Court that while 
president of Far Western Bank in 1984 he helped to provide bad credit 
information to five casinos: Binion's Horseshoe, the Las Vegas Hilton, the MGM 
Grand Hotel and Casino, the Sands Hotel and Casino and the Desert Inn and 
Country Club. 
He faces up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Sentencing before 
District Judge Stephen V. Wilson is scheduled for Jan. 18. 
The five casinos extended loans worth thousands of dollars to Robert Benjamin, 
John DeMattia and Morton Goodman. 
DeMattia pleaded guilty to wire fraud in April, 1988, in connection with the 
scheme. He also pleaded guilty to extortion in an unrelated case and received a 
three-year prison sentence. 
Goodman, who is trying to negotiate a plea bargain in the case, and DeMattia 
are alleged associates of a Los Angeles organized crime family, according to 
Department of Justice special attorney Drew Pitt. 
Pitt said he did not know how McGinnis first became associated with the men. 
McGinnis was indicted in October, 1987, on 19 counts of conspiracy and wire 
fraud. All but one of the counts were dropped as part of a plea bargain.
