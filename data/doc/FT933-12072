FT  27 JUL 93 / Schering MS drug approved in US
THE FIRST effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (MS) has been approved
for use in the US, the world's largest market, by the Food and Drug
Administration.
The approval is the first anywhere in the world for the drug, called
Betaseron, which was developed by Schering, the German bioscience group.
It is the first to treat the underlying disease. Existing therapies only
reduce the symptoms of illness, not its progression.
Schering's shares rose DM15.50 to DM850.
The medicine, a biotechnology-derived product, was recommended by an FDA
advisory committee in March for the treatment of relapsing/remitting
multiple sclerosis.
It was only submitted in June last year, which demonstrates the FDA's belief
in the urgent need for the product.
The drug has proved difficult to manufacture in commercial quantities and
will be made in the US by Chiron Corp, a Californian-based company which
will receive 15 per cent of sales. Chiron's shares rose Dollars 3 1/2 to
Dollars 68 1/2 .
Schering is building a European production facility and plans to start
clinical trials there shortly.
The disease affects as many as 350,000 people in the US, of whom between
125,000 and 150,000 suffer from this form of multiple sclerosis. In Europe
there are about 3m multiple sclerosis sufferers. About 65 per cent of
patients are women.
Betaseron will cost between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 7,000 per patient per
year. Schering estimates treatment of multiple sclerosis can currently cost
up to Dollars 20,000 a year.
The German group is predicting annual sales of up to DM750m by the end of
the decade.
The approval was given on the basis of a trial of more than 300 multiple
sclerosis patients.
It showed that Betaseron can double the time between attacks as well as
lessening their severity. Side effects include fevers and flu-like symptoms.
