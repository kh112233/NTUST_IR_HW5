THE WORLD 
Iraq informed Britain that it has detained a British nurse in connection with 
the activities of a British-based journalist arrested last month, the Foreign 
Office said in London. An Iraqi spokesman said Daphne Parish, 45, was arrested 
Sept. 19 while working in a private hospital in Baghdad. Iraqi authorities, who 
have so far refused to grant British consular officials access to Parish, told 
the Foreign Office that her detention is linked to the arrest Sept. 15 of 
Farzat Bazoft. The Observer newspaper said last month that Bazoft covered 
elections in Kurdistan and then went to the Al Iskandria area south of Baghdad 
to investigate reports of a huge explosion.
