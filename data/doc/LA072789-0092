STEROID PRIMER; 
CHEMISTS, COACHES STRESS TESTING IN HIGH SCHOOLS 
A coaches' association, in conjunction with the American Assn. for Clinical 
Chemistry, Wednesday announced plans to send each U.S. high school a primer on 
steroids, stressing testing as the best method to stop abuse. 
The "High School Coaches' Guide to Steroid Use and Detection" will be sent to 
about 19,000 U.S. high schools before the football season starts, said Skip 
Morris, executive director of the National High School Athletic Coaches Assn. 
The guide, produced by the chemists' association, claims steroid use is growing 
to epidemic proportions among high school athletes and that the only sure-fire 
method of detection is from a urinalysis. 
Anabolic steroids, a derivative of the male hormone testosterone, can enhance 
muscle development and performance, but doctors claim the drugs have harmful 
side effects, particularly for teen-agers. 
"Schools are beginning to look at testing programs as a tool to rid their 
schools of these dangerous drugs," Morris said. "A complete program of 
education and testing can move us forward." 
Because the cost of a steroid test is approaching $200, Morris said most 
schools would choose random testing. He dismissed possible civil rights and 
privacy objections, saying many young athletes have asked for testing programs. 
Morris said high school athletes already conform to certain requirements, such 
as maintaining their grades, and suggested that drug testing could be an 
additional requirement to play.
