Proposed rule.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing changes in our current regulations on alternative forms of
annuity to implement the changes in sections 8343a and 8420a of title 5, United States Code, made by the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993. These regulations provide for the termination of the alternative form of annuity for
employees whose annuities commence on or after October 1, 1994, except for employees who have a life-threatening
affliction of other critical medical condition. They would also revise the list of critical medical conditions considered


prima facie

 evidence of eligibility. The regulations are necessary to conform the current regulations with current law.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Since 1986, some individuals retiring under the Civil Service Retirement System or the Federal Employees Retirement
System have been eligible to elect an alternative form of annuity. The alternative form of annuity consisted of a lump-sum
payment of the individual's retirement deductions plus reduced monthly benefits. The amount of the reduction was
determined so that the present value of the future unreduced annuity would be actuarially equivalent to the present
value of the lump sum plus the future reduced annuity payments.



The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 10366, amended sections 8343a and 8420a of title 5, United
States Code, to limit eligibility for the alternative form of annuity for individuals whose annuities commence on
or after October 1, 1994, to those with a ``life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition.'' These
regulations would change sections 831.2203(h) and 842.703(d) to reflect this new statutory eligibility requirement.

Our proposed change in sections 831.2207 and 842.707 refines the list of medical conditions that constitute 

prima facie

 evidence of a ``life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition.'' We are removing two conditions
from the list (ventricular tachycardia and ventricular flutter). We are also clarifying the severity required for
four other medical conditions before we will accept those conditions as 

prima facie 

evidence. Of course, this change in no way affects a claimant's right to show that medical conditions, not on the list,
are qualifying conditions under sections 831.2207(c)(3)(iv) and 842.707(c)(3)(iv) of Title 5, Code of Federal
Regulations.



E.O. 12866, Regulatory Review



This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with E.O. 12866.



Regulatory Flexibility Act



I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
because the regulation will only affect Federal employees and agencies and retirement payments to retired Government
employees and their survivors.
