FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Innovative Technologies to float with
Pounds 25m price tag
Innovative Technologies Group, the manufacturer of polymers and
seaweed-based products for the healthcare industry, said it aimed to raise
Pounds 4.46m from its forthcoming flotation, valuing the company at Pounds
25m.
Funds raised from the placing at 120p per share will be used to repay Pounds
1.3m of borrowings and expand manufacturing facilities for products ranging
from wound dressings to gloves and textiles.
The company already supplies a number of healthcare companies, including
subsidiaries of AP Moller of Denmark and Hafslund Nycomed of Norway, and
said it was close to signing potentially lucra-tive licensing deals with
other partners.
Unlike existing healthcare products on the market, said Mr Keith Gilding,
managing director, its dressings were longer-lasting and could enhance
patient care.
The value of the global market for such products has been estimated at
Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.07bn).
Following the placing, handled by Allied Provincial Securities, dealings are
expected to start on December 15.
