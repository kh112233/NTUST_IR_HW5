CORVETTE HAS HIGHEST CRASH FATALITY RATE; 
SURVEY: FOUR-DOOR VOLVO HAS BEST SURVIVAL RECORD. TYPE OF DRIVERS ALSO A 
FACTOR, INSURANCE GROUP REPORTS. 
The Chevrolet Corvette has the highest death rate in crashes, while a four-door 
Volvo has the lowest, according to a study released today. 
The study shows that 5.2 drivers and passengers die in car wrecks for every 
10,000 1985-87 Corvettes registered in the United States. It also found that 
the Volvo 740-760 four-door had 0.6 deaths per 10,000 vehicles. 
The figures from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety were released by 
the Michigan Assn. of Professional Insurance Agents. 
"Without question the consumer has a better chance of survival when driving a 
larger vehicle," said James Alexander, president of the Michigan association. 
Of the 10 vehicles with the lowest death rates, three were large, six were 
mid-size and only one was a small car -- the Volkswagen Jetta with 1.1 deaths 
per 10,000 vehicles. 
Twelve of the 15 cars with the highest death rates are small, and the other 
three are midsize. Several, including the Corvette at the top of the list, are 
high-performance cars. 
Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the association, said high-performance cars tend 
to have higher death rates because of the type of drivers they attract. 
"The study shows there's a direct correlation between high-performance sports 
models and a higher accident death rate," he said. "The Corvette, Camaro, 
Mustang, Firebird and Dodge Daytona were all in the top 10 in terms of highest 
overall death rate. 
"The average driver in those cars is a man under 30 years old," he said. 
"Industry figures show that cars with a higher percentage of female drivers 
tend to have lower death rates."
