CURRENT PAPERBACKS: "SURELY YOU'RE JOKING, MR. FEYNMAN!" ADVENTURES OF A 
CURIOUS CHARACTER BY RICHARD P. FEYNMAN, AS TOLD TO RALPH LEIGHTON; EDITED BY 
EDWARD HUTCHINGS (BANTAM BOOKS: $8.95) 
When Richard P. Feynman, the late, world-renowned physicist with a passion for 
puzzle-solving and for making mischief, received the call at 4 in the morning 
telling him that he had won the 1965 Nobel Prize for physics, his reaction was 
to say, "Yeah, but I'm sleeping !" By the fifth or sixth call he told the 
reporter from Time magazine, "I don't know how to get out of this thing. Maybe 
I won't accept the prize." But the combustible curmudgeon eventually relented. 
In "Surely You're Joking," Feynman tells stories of his childhood in Far 
Rockaway, of his studies at MIT and Princeton, of his experience on the 
Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, of his work as professor at Cornell and 
Caltech and of his research in theoretical physics. 
Feynman's indefatigable enthusiasm for solving puzzles, whether deciphering 
Mayan hieroglyphics, cracking high-security safes in Los Alamos or solving the 
mystery of liquid helium is consistently and utterly infectious.
