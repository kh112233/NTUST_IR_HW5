SUMMARY 
                                         Like its predecessor the Supreme Soviet, the State Duma, 
con tending that current media coverage of the legislature is 
biased, is attempting to extend its control over the media, 
voting to create its own television and radio production company 
and preparing legislation mandating extensive, commentary-free 
coverage of government bodies.  Apparently attempting to preserve 
another potential means of control, the Duma is ignoring calls to 
enact industry-wide tax exemptions to ease the serious financial 
crunch affecting the press, preferring instead to continue the 
system of subsidies allocated on a case-by-case basis.  Although 
the Duma's actions threaten to revive a struggle for control of 
the media that was a major point of contention between the 
presidency and the former legislature, President Boris Yeltsin 
has reacted with restraint suggesting that he is confident that 
he can use his levers of control over the media to prevent the 
Duma from gaining the upper hand. 
                                     END SUMMARY 
   The Duma has recently sought to correct what it perceives as 
unfair coverage of legislative activities by the two major state 
television companies and unfair advantages held by the cabinet 
and the executive branch in the media sphere (See Box 1).  Recent 
Duma efforts to influence the media include: 
   --The Law on the Procedure for Coverage of Government Authorities 
by State-Owned Mass Media, approved on a first reading on 13 
April (See Note 1) (ITAR-TASS, 13 April).  According to press 
accounts of draft versions of the law, it would mandate that the 
media cover the activities of the president, the parliament, the 
cabinet, and the judiciary without editorializing; establish 
minimum airtime requirements for such coverage; and grant federal 
and regional officials access to airtime.  In addition, the law 
would diminish the government's influence over the media by 
ending cabinet sponsorship of the dailies Rossiyskiye Vesti and 
Rossiyskaya Gazeta (Obshchaya Gazeta No. 17, 29 April; Moskovskiy 
Komsomolets, 6 April; Novaya Yezhednevnaya Gazeta, 15 April). 
   (Note 1)  According to an account signed to press on 3 May, the 
Duma approved a final version of the law and passed it to the 
Federation Council for consideration (Moskovskiye Novosti, No. 18 
1-8 May).  However, no other sources have been observed to 
confirm this report.  According to the Russian Constitution, the 
Federation Council must take under consideration laws approved by 
the Duma within 14 days, otherwise they are considered approved 
and sent to the president for his consideration (Rossiyskaya 
Gazeta, 10 November).  To date no press reports on the Federation 
Council's consideration of the law have been observed. 
   --In a further effort to increase its influence in television and 
radio broadcasting, on 27 May the Duma adopted a decree creating 
a Duma radio and television company that, according to press 
reports, would reside within the Duma apparatus and be charged 
with producing 30-minute daily programs on Duma activities for 
broadcasting "at a time convenient for the population" (Interfax, 
27 May; Segodnya, 28 May). 
   Conspicuously missing from the Duma's legislative agenda has been 
a bill to free the press of tax burdens and alleviate other 
publishing expenses.  Federation Council Chairman Vladimir 
Shumeyko has proposed such legislation, which would alleviate the 
need for subsidies and reduce the possibilities for political 
manipulation of the press (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 20 May).  But 
according to ITAR-TASS (20 April) a bill to grant tax preferences 
to the media has "stumbled in parliament," making it likely that 
subsidies will continue for the foreseeable future. 
   "Parliamentary Hour" Revisited? 
   Much of the media commentary on the Duma's decision to create its 
own television and radio company has criticized the move as an 
attempt to reanimate the former Supreme Soviet's RTV-Parliament, 
the television production company which the pro-reform media 
viewed as a tendentious and unpopular propaganda vehicle for the 
former legislature.  An Izvestiya reporter mused (3 June) on 
whether history would "repeat itself and replicate a failed 
experiment," and Rossiyskiye Vesti (15 April) cited Ostankino 
Deputy Chairman Gennadiy Shipitko's comment that "programs like 
'Parliamentary Hour' . . . will not . . . fire us with 
enthusiasm," while a Moskovskiy Komsomolets reporter 
characterized the Duma's action as a "program for the radical 
brainwashing of the citizens" (30 March).  In fact, as if to 
confirm fears of a reprise of "Parliamentary Hour," the Duma has 
reportedly chosen Yuriy Marechenkov, former head of RTV- 
Parliament and one-time media affairs adviser to Yeltsin's arch- 
rival, former Supreme Soviet Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov, to head 
the new company (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 30 March). 
   As Shipitko's comment suggests, television network officials have 
shown little enthusiasm for reviving broadcasts of programming 
produced by parliament, and the parliament may find it difficult 
to force the issue.  The Duma, unlike the old Supreme Soviet, 
does not have sponsorship authority over the All-Russian 
Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (RTV) and therefore 
cannot simply issue orders to the network.  RTV Chairman Oleg 
Poptsov, who was ordered to air "Parliamentary Hour" by the 
Supreme Soviet (Vedomosti Syezda Narodnykh Deputatov Rossiyskoy 
Federatsii i Verkhovnogo Soveta Rossiyskoy Federatsii, No. 13, 1 
April 1993), has said that the Duma's decree attests to 
"pretensions to a certain informational exclusivity" that could 
provoke a chain reaction from the other branches of government, 
leading to the development of what he sarcastically called a 
variety of "wonderful" radio and television services each serving 
a different branch of government, rather than the viewer 
(Segodnya, 28 May).  While the Duma's budget authority does give 
it potential leverage over RTV and Ostankino, threats to cut 
television financing for refusing to air parliamentary 
programming would most likely alienate television-viewing 
constituents and meet considerable resistance from Yeltsin. 
   Even if the Duma could convince one or both of the major 
companies to air its programming, the expense of creating and 
equipping a new production company from scratch would likely 
prove prohibitive.  According to Yuliy Nisnevich, chairman of the 
parliamentary Subcommittee on Computer Science and 
Communications, such a venture would cost "millions of dollars," 
leading him to speculate that allocation of the money for such a 
project is "unlikely" (Izvestiya, 3 June). 
   Yeltsin's Opposition 
   Although Yeltsin has firmly condemned the Duma's decree, he does 
not appear to be trying to rally public opposition, suggesting 
confidence in the strength of his position and a desire to 
discourage confrontation while he is aiming his primary effort in 
domestic policy at reducing political tension and creating an 
atmosphere of cooperation.  A "Vesti" news report asserted that 
Yeltsin had objected to the Duma's decision to create its own 
television service, calling it "an attempt at information diktat" 
that would demonstrate the Duma's desire to "destroy the existing 
balance of powers" between the branches of government (Russian 
TV, 27 May).  Yeltsin's press spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov 
accused the Duma of "encroaching" on freedom of the press 
(Segodnya, 28 May) and, in an apparent reference to Yeltsin's 
victory over the Supreme Soviet in the violent political showdown 
last fall, he advised the Duma that Yeltsin "urges the deputies 
to take into account the lessons of living history" and to show 
"wisdom and political tact" (Interfax, 27 May).  After these 
initial statements, Yeltsin's administration has not been 
observed to comment on the matter and neither he nor the 
reporters who questioned him raised the issue during his 10 June 
speech and press conference, where he lauded his own recent 
efforts to bring about political accord in society (Russian TV, 
10 June). 
   Shumeyko Also Opposed 
   Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko has also taken 
issue with the Duma's actions, calling them undemocratic and 
proposing his own bill that would give the press across-the-board 
tax exemptions.  He reportedly wrote to Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin 
that the draft law on media coverage looks "like an army drill 
instruction" and "has nothing in common with democracy and the 
free press" and asserted that "the constitution's ban on 
censorship is . . . breached by a whole range of the bill's 
clauses" (Interfax, 23 May).  He also offered his own media 
initiative, a proposal for a draft law that would address the 
acute financial difficulties facing the press.  The law would 
exempt the press from payment of the profits tax and value-added 
tax, from import and export duties, and from compulsory sale to 
the state of 50 percent of their hard currency earnings 
(Rossiyskiye Vesti, 20 May). 
   Chernomyrdin Addresses Press Finances 
   Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, without responding explicitly 
to the Duma's initiatives, has turned his attention to the 
press's acute financial difficulties and issued a directive 
allocating 110.4 billion rubles to support the print media (See 
Box 2) (ITAR-TASS, 27 April).  At the same time, according to 
Chernomyrdin's subordinate Boris Mironov, chairman of the Russian 
Federation Committee for the Press, Chernomyrdin supports a draft 
law on state protection for the media that would exempt print 
media from customs duties on newsprint and printing equipment, 
and grant them a 50-percent discount on postal, telegraph, and 
telephone costs that would amount to an additional 1 billion 
rubles in support to the press (Izvestiya, 29 April). 
   Outlook 
   With television remaining state-owned and the press either state- 
sponsored or partially subsidized, control over the media will 
probably continue to be a source of contention, and the 
parliament will be unlikely to resist the temptation to attain a 
greater share of influence over the media.  Its efforts could 
backfire, however, spurring administration efforts to 
denationalize the state's media holdings to keep them out of the 
hands of the legislature.  For example, privatization of all 
television programming production--estimates already suggest as 
much as 80 percent of Ostankino's programming is privately 
produced (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 1 April)--while retaining government 
control over the television broadcasting infrastructure could 
give Yeltsin a large advantage over the opposition:  pro-reform 
television programs would be produced privately and thus beyond 
the reach of the parliament's authority while the administration 
would retain ultimate control over access to broadcasting. 
   ***BEGIN BOX 1*** 
   Decline in Legislature's Influence Over Media 
   Following the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet in September, the 
cabinet assumed sponsorship of all media formerly sponsored by 
the Supreme Soviet.  These included, most importantly, the All- 
Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company (RTV) and 
the daily newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta.*  The presidency, 
meanwhile, assumed significant new authority in the media sphere 
with the adoption of the new constitution, which makes the 
president the guarantor of media freedoms, and through Yeltsin's 
recent reorganization of the media bureaucracy.**  The new 
Federal Assembly currently sponsors no media and aside from its 
budget making authority has little de jure authority over the 
media. 
   *The Cabinet continues to sponsor these media as well as the 
Ostankino Television and Radio Company and Rossiyskiye Vesti, 
inter alia. 
   **On Yeltsin's reorganization of the media bureaucracy see the 
Trends of 2 March 1994, pages 11-18. 
   ***END BOX 1*** 
   ***BEGIN BOX 2*** 
                     Press Subsidies--Opening Pandora's Cash-Box 
   A recently published list of members to the new commission to 
distribute press subsidies in Russia seems weighted to favor pro- 
reformers.  Sergey Gryzunov, deputy chairman of the Russian 
Federation Committee for the Press will head the commission.  The 
list of members also includes Presidential Press Secretary 
Vyacheslav Kostikov; Yabloko member Igor Yakovenko from the Duma 
Committee on Information Policy and Communications; Omsk Governor 
Leonid Polezhayev from the Federal Assembly; and Igor 
Shabdurasulov from the Council of Ministers, as well as Russian 
Journalists Union Chairman Vsevolod Bogdanov; Yasen Zasurskiy, 
dean of the Journalism Faculty at Moscow State University; and 
Ivan Laptev, president of the Russian Association of Publishers 
and Editors-in-chief and former member of Izvestiya's editorial 
board (ITAR-TASS, 25 May). 
   By opting for a policy of subsidizing individual newspapers on a 
case-by-case basis rather than offering blanket concessions on 
production costs, the government has opened the door wide to 
discrimination, politicization, and deal-making and created 
incentives for self-censorship.  Discussing the commission's 
distribution predilections at a recent press conference, Gryzunov 
said that publications with a "worldwide reputation" would be 
given a "priority right" to survival (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 6 
May).  In a recent Izvestiya (28 May) profile, Press Committee 
Chairman Boris Mironov, Gryzunov's boss, asserted his intention 
to protect Russia's "national heritage," meaning, in Izvestiya's 
interpretation, such publications as Pravda, Sovetskaya Rossiya, 
and Trud.  If the subsidy committee does in fact give priority to 
publications with a long history, it would benefit the opposition 
press and put pro-reform papers at a disadvantage.
