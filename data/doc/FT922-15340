FT  01 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Speyhawk tumbles on results
THE DEPRESSED property sector was dealt a further blow as developer Speyhawk
delivered catastrophic interim results which included a Pounds 217m loss, a
huge financial restructuring and a warning from the chairman that no
dividends would be paid 'for some time'. The shares collapsed to end 8 1/2
down at 2 1/2 p in heavy turnover of 5.4m.
Although bad results were anticipated, the scale of the company's
write-downs surprised many in the market. Mr Gary Baker at County NatWest
said: 'Speyhawk overextended itself and was crucified by its central London
office developments. Probably the most amazing thing is that the banks are
still supporting a company with a negative net worth of over Pounds 5 per
share.'
He added that other developers were also suffering like Speyhawk and that a
number could be counted as in 'de facto' receivership.
Speyhawk is only the latest in a number of news items which have hit
sentiment in the property sector. Worries over Olympia &amp; York, Heron,
Control Securities and also the prospect of a Labour victory in the general
election have all acted as a drag on shares.
Yesterday, City Site lost 6 to 60p, Hammerson ordinary 9 to 442p, MEPC 6 to
306p and Slough Estates 7 to 168p.
Lonrho hit again
Confirmation that UBS Phillips &amp; Drew had resigned as joint brokers to
troubled conglomerate Lonrho sent the shares crashing to an 8-year low on
their last day as a FT-SE 100 constituent.
The shares fell by more than 17 per cent, giving up a further 13 1/2 to 65
1/2 p, their lowest level since January 1984, and turnover rose to more than
11.5m.
The possibility of UN sanctions against Libya as a result of its alleged
role in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing continued to overhang the day's business,
with speculation mounting that 9.81 per cent stakeholder Fidelity, of the
US, would sell its holding if sanctions were imposed. Last week Lonrho sold
a third of its Metropole Hotel group to the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment
Company for Pounds 177.5m.
Pharmaceuticals company Wellcome was one of the strongest performers among
the FT-SE 100 constituents. The group announced the brokers for its vaunted
share flotation and two securities houses reiterated their buy stance.
Wellcome said Robert Fleming was to co-ordinate the flotation, stockbrokers
Cazenove and SG Warburg were to handle the flotation in the UK, and Morgan
Stanley, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch would handle the US side.
The market was pleased that some of the uncertainty surrounding the
flotation was out of the way and the shares jumped 27 to 1049p. Both Fleming
and Smith New Court repeated their buy recommendations.
The clearing banks continued to suffer from their exposure to the Olympia &amp;
York and Heron International debts. Barclays, which is seen as having lent
the most cash and is also believed to have an exposure to Speyhawk, fell 10
to 307p, making a drop of 28 over the past three days. It was also one of
the most heavily traded stocks yesterday as more than 8m shares went through
the Seaq electronic ticker.
Midland Bank retreated 8 to 349p in spite of the potential value in its
prospective merger with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking. Lloyds lost 7 to
377p.
Royal Bank of Scotland, down 8 at 154p, suffered from receding bid hopes and
further consideration of its prospects following recent profit forecast
cuts.
Nervousness ahead of its annual figures tomorrow left Sun Alliance 7 off at
267p. James Capel is forecasting a loss of Pounds 450m.
Confirmation that SmithKline Beecham had launched a vaccine in Britain for
Hepatitis A, an infectious liver disease, and a more positive recommendation
from one analyst helped the 'A' shares to remain firm against the market and
close 3 up at 855p. SmithKline's Units rose 35 to 3915p.
The shares received a further push after Nomura Research upgraded its stance
on the stock from a hold to a trading buy. Mr Didier Cowling, Nomura's
pharmaceuticals specialist, said the shares had underperformed recently and
the new vaccine was likely to be a 'noticeable improvement over existing
therapy'.
Specialty chemicals group Croda International forged ahead 17 to 163p on
consideration of the company's full-year results. The profits were in line
with expectations but analysts liked the confident statement. Kleinwort
Benson raised its 1992 forecast by Pounds 1m to Pounds 27.6m.
Regional brewers provided most interest in the drinks sector. JA Devenish
gained 11 to 250p on renewed speculation about a bid. Boddington, holder of
a 20 per cent stake in Devenish, slipped 2 to 168p.
Morland has announced it is having talks with a possible bidder, but lost 10
to 433p yesterday as speculation about a Devenish bid faded.
Siebe, which today becomes a FT-SE 100 constituent, was 7 up at 646p on the
prospect of a US economic recovery. The company derives 45 per cent of its
sales from the US. Johnson Matthey, 12 ahead at 386p, was also boosted by US
recovery hopes.
Wholesaler Nurdin &amp; Peacock fell 8 to 156p. Profits in 1991 rose to Pounds
27.6 from Pounds 25.8m and Nurdin said sales were up on the previous year
but margins were under pressure.
Stores group Kingfisher renewed its slide to end 12 lower at 471p on
profit-taking after recent good figures.
A big placing in Queens Moat Houses saw the hotel group edge ahead 1 1/2 to
77p in turnover of 7m. Battery Marche, the US brokerage, is believed to have
sold a block of 3.4m shares into the market at 75 1/2 p, most of which was
later placed with institutions by a leading house at 76p. The stock had been
overhanging the market since last week - when it was being offered at 80p -
and has been undermining the share price.
News from Pearson on Monday that BSkyB would be profitable by the second
half of 1993 lifted another BSkyB shareholder, Granada Group, 10 to 230p.
Pilkington, Europe's biggest glassmaker, was in demand following a
well-received institutional meeting on Monday. The company announced
yesterday that it had licensed a part of its low-emissivity technology to a
big US glass manufacturer. The shares edged up a penny to 125p in busy
volume of 3.9m.
