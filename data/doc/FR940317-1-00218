 

(5) A statement of the facility's capability of producing captive-bred birds of the species and in the numbers they
wish to export to the United States, including: 
(i) Relevant experience of persons involved in the operation of the facility; 
(ii) Current stock of the facility, including total number, ages, sexes, and numbers of breeding pairs; 
(iii) Production levels that have been achieved at the facility, at least for the past two complete calendar years,
including numbers of eggs produced, chicks hatched, and chicks reared to independence; 
(iv) Anticipated future production; 
(v) A breeding protocol, including a genetic management plan and a description of breeding methods. Breeding methods
shall include whether breeding is continuous or seasonal (including descriptions of photoperiod manipulations
used to stimulate or control breeding, if any) and whether breeding birds are induced to produce multiple clutches
by the removal of eggs for artificial incubation; and 
(vi) Descriptions of incubation and rearing methods, as well as any other methods used to enhance production, including
artificial insemination when applicable; 
(6) A statement demonstrating that the facility is operated in a manner that is not detrimental to the survival of the
species in the wild, including: 
(i) The number and origin of original breeding stock (founders); 
(ii) A statement from the Scientific Authority of the country in which the facility is located attesting that the parental
stock was established in a manner that was not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild; 
(iii) If any parental breeding stock was wild-caught, a statement as to the country of origin, date of acquisition,
and certification by the Management Authority in the country in which the facility is located that the parental breeding
stock was legally acquired; and 
(iv) Certification from the Management Authority in the country in which the facility is located that adequate controls,
including inspections, are in place to prevent the use of the facility for the export of wild-caught stock; 
(7) A statement of any anticipated need for augmentation of breeding stock with specimens from other sources; if augmentation
is to be from the wild, an explanation as to why the removal of additional specimens from the wild shall be included.
This explanation must address whether other captive-bred stock is available and describe breeding strategies employed
at the facility to avoid deleterious inbreeding so that the need for augmentation from the wild is minimized; 
(8) A statement describing the facility and demonstrating that it is operated in a humane and healthful manner, including:

(i) Diagrams or photographs of the facility; 
(ii) Descriptions of enclosures, including dimensions, construction materials, substrates, availability of
water, lighting, ventilation, the need for supplemental heat or cooling and how these are provided, and shading (for
outdoor enclosures); 
(iii) Densities of birds in enclosures; 
(iv) Internal features of enclosures, including perches, nest boxes, and plantings; and 
(v) A description of any facility features designed to satisfy unique requirements of the particular species; 
(9) A description of the care and maintenance practices of the facility, including: 
(i) Husbandry practices, feeding regimes (number of feedings per day), and diet; 
(ii) Hygienic practices, including methods and frequency of cleaning and disinfection of equipment and facilities;

(iii) A statement as to the availability of routine professional veterinary care, including annual flock inspection
or examination, and medication/vaccination schedules; 
(iv) Records of mortality and disease outbreaks for both adults and chicks for at least the past two years. Episodes
of high mortality or disease should be explained, and measures taken to prevent similar mortality or disease outbreaks
in the future should be described; and 
(v) Qualifications and experience of the personnel who will be responsible for the care of the exotic birds; 
(10) A statement that all birds exported or to be exported from the facility are bred at the facility and are marked with
closed leg bands or an electronic marking system; 
(11) Details on the system of recordkeeping and tracking of birds and their progeny hatched at the facility, including:

(i) Documentation that the facility maintains records of hatch dates and band numbers of all birds produced at the
facility;
