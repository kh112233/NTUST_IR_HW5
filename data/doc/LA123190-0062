POLICEMAN, 4 OTHERS DIE IN NATAL PROVINCE 
A policeman and four civilians were shot or stabbed to death in political and 
factional black violence in strife-torn Natal province, police said Sunday. 
The violence followed an outburst of fighting in black townships of the Indian 
Ocean province on Friday that left 12 people dead in the most serious clashes 
since Christmas Day.
