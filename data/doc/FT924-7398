FT  17 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Two businessmen to appeal sentences
for supply of arms-making equipment to Iraq
TWO BUSINESSMEN who supplied arms-making equipment to Iraq may appeal their
sentences.
Mr Brian Mason and Mr Stuart Blackledge, who ran Ordnance Technology in
Reading, were among four men who admitted illegally exporting such equipment
to Iraq in February. Mr Mason was given a nine-month suspended sentence and
Mr Blackledge six months suspended.
They say their cases would have been dismissed if they had been tried after
Matrix Churchill and if they had access to government papers.
