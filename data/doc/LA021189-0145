DRIVER KILLED AFTER HITTING BUS IDENTIFIED 
A woman who was killed after she allegedly ran a red light and struck an 
out-of-service OCTD bus in Santa Ana has been identified as Linda Dianna 
Kinwald, 39, of Fountain Valley, authorities said Friday. 
Witnesses said Kinwald was westbound on Sunflower Avenue in her 1982 Chrysler 
coupe about 10 p.m. Thursday when she ran the light at Harbor Boulevard. The 
bus dragged the car and a signal light pole with it into the southbound lanes 
of Harbor Boulevard, shattering an Orange County Transit District bus shelter. 
The coroner's office said Kinwald died instantly. 
The bus driver, 45-year-old Gloria Novotny of Anaheim, was not injured in the 
accident, and there were no passengers aboard the bus. 
Novotny, who has been driving for OCTD for 14 years, "is one of the best 
drivers in the district," OCTD spokeswoman Joanne Curran said. She added that 
Novotny was going to receive an award from the transit district for her safe 
driving record. The Department of Motor Vehicles said Novotny has a clean 
driving record. 
Services have not been scheduled for Kinwald, the mother of two children, 
Sally, 12, and Brian, 15. 
Kinwald, who worked for Lorimar Home Video in Culver City, is also survived by 
her mother, Mardell Frazier of Port Angeles, Wash.; sisters Bobbie Foye, 41, of 
Washington state, Mary Johns, 34, of San Bernardino, Kathy Howell, 30, of 
California, Terrie Hibbard, 31, of Washington, and her brother, Thomas Greene, 
38, also of Washington.
