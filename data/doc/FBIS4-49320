  [Text] Beijing, May 5 KYODO -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said Thursday [5 May] that China is willing to 
establish friendly relations in all areas with the new 
government of South Africa. 
  "China rejoices in the historical victory won by South 
Africa 
and President Jiang Zemin has sent a letter of congratulations 
to (Nelson) Mandela on the victory of the ANC (African National 
Congress) in the general election," Wu Jianmen told journalists. 
  China, which has refused to establish diplomatic relations 
with South Africa due to its system of apartheid, will be 
sending a delegation from the China-Africa Friendship 
Association led by Vice President Xie Banding to Mandela's May 
10 inauguration, he said. 
  Wu refused to say when and if diplomatic relations between 
the two countries will be established.
