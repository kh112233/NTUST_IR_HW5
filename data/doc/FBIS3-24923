  [Text] The epilogue to the 22-year-old territorial dispute 
between Chad and Libya has been written: The Aouzou Strip well 
and truly belongs to Chad. This sums up the verdict issued by 
the International Court of Justice [ICJ] of the Hague. There 
were 16 votes for and only one -- obviously that of the 
temporary Libyan judge -- against. The ICJ's ruling is of 
course satisfactory to Chadian President Idriss Deby: 
  [Begin recording] [Deby] The most important thing for us, 
under the circumstances, is that the law has been applied and 
also that this problem, which lasted too long and cost so many 
human lives, has been resolved peacefully. I am therefore happy 
with the outcome.... 
  [Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou, interrupting] Mr. President, do 
you think that Libya will comply with this verdict, this 
important decision by the ICJ? 
  [Deby] I believe so. Yes, I certainly believe, and, I would 
even say, I am convinced that Libya will keep its promises 
before the ICJ. From the moment when we jointly agreed to 
submit ourselves to the arbitration of the ICJ, we made a 
promise. Therefore, based on this promise, I am convinced that 
Libya will keep its promises to the ICJ. [end recording]
