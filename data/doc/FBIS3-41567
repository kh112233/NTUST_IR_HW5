  [Text] Malaysia and Indonesia will jointly safeguard 
environment of the Straits of Melaka by enhancing coordination 
of the existing working mechanism. Defense Minister Datuk Sri 
Najib Tun Razak said this in a joint news conference at the end 
of the 22d meeting of the Malaysia-Indonesia General Border 
Committee in Kuala Lumpur. The Indonesian side was represented 
by the chief of the Armed Forces, General Feisal Tanjung. 
  Datuk Sri Najib also said both countries will consider 
creating duty-free zones at border areas as part of a program to 
stimulate trade exchanges. Both sides noted that there have 
been an increasing number of smuggling activities and pollution 
incidents in the straits. Cases of piracy, however, have been 
reduced significantly. The next General Border Committee 
meeting of the two countries will be held in Jakarta in November 
next year.
