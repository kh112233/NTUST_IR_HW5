FT  26 MAY 94 / US businessman in talks with Sinn Fein
A senior Irish-American businessman is holding informal talks with Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA, in an effort to bring about peace in
Nothern Ireland.
It emerged yesterday that Mr William Flyn, president of Mutual America, one
of the biggest US insurance companies, has renewed contact with Sinn Fein
while on a visit this week to Dublin and Belfast.
Mr Flyn is part of a delegation of Irish-American businessmen who have been
discussing investment oppor-tunities on both sides of the Irish border with
government officials and local enterprises. He is understood to have used
the opportunity of the visit to try to persuade Sinn Fein of the growing
support within the Irish-American community for the UK-Irish peace
initiative.
Mr Flyn was one of the central figures behind the controversial visit of Mr
Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, to New York in February. His invitation to
Mr Adams to speak at a conference on Northern Ireland led to President Bill
Clinton granting the Sinn Fein leader a visa against the advice of British
and US state department officials.
Mr Flyn believes the visit helped strengthen Mr Adams's influence within the
IRA in support of the peace initiative and exposed republican militants to
the moderation of most Irish Americans. He said yesterday that continuing
paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland remained the 'biggest obstacle' to
increased US investment in the province, but he felt 'encouraged' about the
prospects for peace.
Northern Ireland officials regard the US as important to the local economy -
38 US companies operate in the province employing about 9 per cent of the
manufacturing workforce, much of it in Roman Catholic areas.
The visit by US company executives follows a plea by Mr John Major, the
prime minister, during his visit to the US in March that the influence of
corporate Irish-America be brought to bear on producing peace in Northern
Ireland.
