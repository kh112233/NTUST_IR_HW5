FT  08 MAY 93 / Argentina in protest to UK
Argentina yesterday protested against Britain's decision to extend its
territorial waters around the disputed South Georgia and South Sandwich
island in the South Atlantic, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires.
Britain has extended to 200 miles its 12-mile (19km) territorial
jurisdiction in waters surrounding the islands, situated east of the
Falkland Islands, in order to counter over-fishing by third countries.
