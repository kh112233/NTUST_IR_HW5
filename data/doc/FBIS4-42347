<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller by Lucian O. </F>
Meysels; place and date not given: "Turkey Is Pushing Into the 
European Union"] 
  [Text] [Meysels] The Kurdish problem and terrorism are 
currently dominating the reports about Turkey. Do you feel 
under pressure? 
  [Ciller] Unfortunately, most reports in the Western media 
are biased. As a result, the Western public gets a completely 
inaccurate picture. The struggle against terrorism is only a 
small part of the Turkish reality. All too often one overlooks 
Turkey's efforts for peace in the Middle East and also its 
function as a bridge between Europe and the new states in 
Central Asia. 
  [Meysels] What can you do yourself to improve this allegedly 
biased image? 
  [Ciller] Simply present the real facts. Turkey is a free 
democratic state, whose the government must answer to 
parliament. If more people could see Turkey with their own 
eyes, we would meet with greater understanding. 
  [Meysels] How do you assess Amnesty International's 
criticism of the Turkish authorities? 
  [Ciller] We see Amnesty International as a leading 
nongovernmental organization that has set itself the task of 
enforcing the observation of human rights. Unfortunately, 
Amnesty International does not always stick to its declared 
goals, particularly when the human rights of the victims of 
terrorism are involved. It seems as if Amnesty International is 
dealing only with those human rights violations that are 
committed by governments. 
  [Meysels] How much damage have the terrorist attacks caused 
to Turkish tourism? 
  [Ciller] No country in the world is immune to terrorism. In 
fact, one barely feels the terrorism in our country's tourism 
region, which is outside the most extreme southeast. 
Unfortunately, individual attacks are inflated by the 
international media. Regarding our foreign guests, Turkey is an 
extremely safe country for them. Losses were marginal last 
year, and we expect similar results for 1994. 
  [Meysels] Does rising fundamentalism in Turkey endanger 
Ataturk's secular legacy? 
  [Ciller] Since the founding of the Republic (in 1923) 
Ataturk's principles have been put into practice: secularism, 
democracy, and the rule-of-law state. For the overwhelming 
majority of citizens they are already a way of life. I do not 
believe that radical elements will ever manage to endanger these 
principles. 
  [Meysels] In particular, emancipated women are the target of 
fundamentalists.... 
  [Ciller] The policy of the fundamentalists is aimed against 
everyone who oppose their goals, be it men or women. As regards 
Turkish women, they play an important role in political and 
social life. It would be irrational to think that one could 
restrict women's rights. 
  [Meysels] How far have Turkey's efforts to join the European 
Union come? 
  [Ciller] Since the early 1960's we have had an association 
treaty, the declared goals of which is full membership. In 
1987, we applied for full membership, and the opinion of the 
(then European Community) Commission was positive. Now we are 
in the process of establishing a customs union. This would be a 
concrete step toward integrating our economy into the European 
Union and will certainly speed up our efforts for membership. 
  [Meysels] In conclusion, a question about the most acute 
conflict in Europe: What has Turkey done so far to help the 
Bosnian Moslems? 
  [Ciller] Turkey is doing everything in its power to 
facilitate a settlement of the conflict in the Balkans. There 
are close historical ties between Turks and Bosnians. We have 
recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent state and have 
participated in all international initiatives. The Turkish 
UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] contingent is 
standing ready... 
  [Meysels] ...while other states are reducing their troop 
strengths. 
  [Ciller] ...and its presence would make an important 
contribution to reestablishing peace and preventing the fighting 
from spreading to other regions.
