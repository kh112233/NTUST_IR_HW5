FT  18 NOV 94 / Tunnel effect on homes outlined
Nearly 100 homes will be demolished and a further 70 will lose part of their
gardens to make way for the Channel tunnel rail link and the associated
widening of the M2 motorway, the department of transport said yesterday.
Details of the impact of the proposed Pounds 2.7bn rail link on communities
and the countryside were published in environmental statements required for
such projects.
The statements, comprising 12 documents and 54 volumes of special reports,
will play an important role in determining the level of protest to the
proposals. Several thousand petitions are expected to be put to the select
committee which considers the plan.
About 410 homes will be affected by noise from passing trains and a further
1,600 will experience groundborne noise and vibration. About 160 are on the
Mardyke Park Estate, Purfleet, where the line will be on a viaduct.
The rail link will swallow 850 acres of agricultural land. Some 75 acres of
ancient woodland will be lost and 21 listed buildings will be demolished.
The M2 widening will take 173 acres from the edge of the Kent Downs and
consume 57 acres of woodland, although these will be replanted.
The rail link will affect ground water resources near Pepper Hill, in the
Nashenden Valley and at Thurnham.
The bill authorising construction of the rail line and the motorway widening
is expected to be put to parliament on November 24. Its passage is expected
to take two years.
