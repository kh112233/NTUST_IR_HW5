LOCAL; 
VALLEY ROBBERY SUSPECTS CAUGHT 
Two men suspected of carrying out a recent string of convenience-store 
robberies in the San Fernando Valley were arrested this morning in Granada 
Hills after sheriff's deputies followed them from a failed robbery in La Canada 
and tracked them down using police dogs, authorities said. 
Ralph Cruz, 23, and James Bailey, 24, of Pacoima, were taken to USC Medical 
Center for treatment of dog bites to their arms and heads. 
Bailey was reported to be in stable condition at the hospital. Cruz was being 
held at the Los Angeles County Central Jail facility, a sheriff's detective 
said. 
The men were arrested on suspicion of auto theft and attempted robbery. Bail 
was set at $11,000 for both men, Det. Marvin Cheyno of the Sheriff's 
Department's Crescenta Valley station said. 
The two allegedly drove a stolen car to a gasoline station mini-mart on Angeles 
Crest Highway near the 210 Freeway in La Canada Flintridge, where they tried to 
break down a locked door just after midnight. The mini-mart was closed but an 
attendant was inside to serve gasoline customers. 
Cheyno said the attendant called police and deputies on patrol spotted the 
suspects on the 210 Freeway.
