FT  14 SEP 94 / EPA moves to review dioxin emission control
The Environmental Protection Agency in the US yesterday came a step closer
to regulating emissions of dioxin. It opened public debate on a toxic
compound which it links with cancer, reproductive and immune disorders and
other health problems.
The federal agency released a review draft, confirming its 1985 findings on
the toxic dangers of dioxin, the chemical compound created by the combustion
of some types of waste, as well as by chlorine bleaching of pulp and paper.
After 120 days of the EPA taking comments, the issue of dioxin emission
control will go for a review which could shape new rules. These could be
ready by September 1995.
Vietnam war veterans said that the report should clear the way to more
compensation for ex-soldiers exposed to the chemical compound Agent Orange.
Retired Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, head of a US veterans' committee on the issue,
said in Hanoi yesterday he would ask President Bill Clinton and
congressional committees to provide more funds for research on effects of
dioxin.
The EPA study is likely to provoke a response from industries dealing with
medical and municipal waste, as well as paper producers. Dr Lynn Goldman,
EPA assistant administrator for prevention, pesticides and toxics, stressed
the agency's willingness 'to build a broad scientific consensus on dioxin's
toxic effects'.
The report finds 'the highly toxic compound  .. a proven animal carcinogen
and a probable human carcinogen', but the agency does not intend to act
immediately on its findings. It is to decide appropriate measures in the
light of reaction by industry and science.
According to the draft study, waste combustion accounts for about 95 per
cent of all known emissions. Most of this is from medical and municipal
waste incineration.
