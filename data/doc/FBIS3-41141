  [Text] According to the 4th Army Division commander 
[General Carlos Julio Gil], the Cali Cartel is moving its 
cocaine processing and exporting headquarters to Vichada 
Department. The Army Division commander personally flew to the 
zone to organize the struggle against this scourge. 
  The eastern plains have become the new sanctuary for 
cocaine. 
The drug cartels, especially the Cali Cartel, have chosen this 
region as a safe haven for their laboratories. An estimated 70 
percent of the alkaloid is being produced in this zone, 
particularly in Vichada Department. 
  [Begin General Carlos Julio Gil recording] It appears that 
the country's cartels have agreed to work in the plains. [end 
recording] 
  It was learned that the Medellin and Cali drug lords decided 
to stop processing the alkaloid in their regions in order to 
negotiate with the law. The alleged Valle del Cauca drug 
leaders have reportedly set a deadline of 15 February for the 
removal of laboratories from that department. Regional 
commanders met with the Army commander at Villavicencio to 
review this new situation. 
  [Begin Army Commander Hernan Jose Guzman recording] We must 
implement new methods, new tactics to face this situation. [end 
recording] 
  Those new tactics will be determined this afternoon after 
the 
military meeting ends. In addition, steps will be taken to 
guarantee the electoral process throughout the country, 
especially in this zone, where numerous municipalities feel the 
pressure of guerrilla forces.
