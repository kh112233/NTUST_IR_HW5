TIRES FORCE PRIZM RECALL 
General Motors Corp. announced Wednesday that its Chevrolet division is 
recalling about 1,600 1990 Geo Prizm subcompact sedans to check for a gradual 
loss of air pressure in the tires. GM said the tire bead, the part that 
connects to the rim, may have been damaged during mounting at the factory.
