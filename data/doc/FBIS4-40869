  [Text] Tallinn, June 20, BNS -- Latest Labor Market 
Department reports show the number of unemployed in Estonia at 
18,621, which corresponds to a jobless rate of 2.21 percent. 
  A decline in the number by 901 from May 1 is attributed to 
seasonal effects, said Inge Rauba, departmental head at the 
department. 
  Regionally, unemployment rates continue to be highest in the 
northeastern Ida-Virumaa region and the city of Kohtla-Jarve, in 
the southern Polvamaa and Vorumaa counties, as well as in the 
western island county of Hiiumaa, where the rate was more than 5 
percent over the national average, Rauba said. 
  The reference for the Labor Market Department Calculations 
is 
the number of working-age population in the country as of Jan. 
1, estimated at 840,790. 
  Estonia as of May 1 had officially registered 19,522 as 
unemployed, which amounted a jobless rate of 2.32 percent.
