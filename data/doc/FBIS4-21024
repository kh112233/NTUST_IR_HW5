  [Text] A 41-year-old Norwegian businessman, living in 
Copenhagen, has been taken into custody for four weeks for 
attempting to smuggle in 42 kilos of hashish from the 
Netherlands. The man was detected Saturday evening in Rodby 
Havn, when the special police and customs officials, with the 
help of a narcotics dog, found the hashish hidden in the bumpers 
of the Norwegian's car.
