WORLD; 
MOTHER TERESA SOVIET MISSIONS SET 
Mother Teresa announced the establishment today of three missions in the Soviet 
Union to help the poor and the sick in Moscow and in the two southern republics 
of Armenia and Georgia. 
An official of the Armenian Peace Committee said four sisters from the 
Missionaries of Charity will live in small mobile homes in that republic, where 
23,000 people died and 500,000 were left homeless in the December, 1988, 
earthquake. 
The frail, 78-year-old Roman Catholic nun, whose charitable work throughout the 
world from her base in Calcutta, India, earned her the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, 
said the Soviet Union is the 80th country in which she has set up missions.
