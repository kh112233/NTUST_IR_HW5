 Proposed rule.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to 
adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing of 
fish and fishery products (hereinafter referred to as seafood). 
These procedures include the monitoring of selected processes in 
accordance with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) 
principles. HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control that 
can be used by food processors and importers. FDA is proposing 
these regulations because a system of preventive controls is the 
most effective and efficient way to ensure that these products 
are safe.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Written comments by March 29, 1994. The agency is proposing 
that any final rule that may be issued based upon this proposal 
become effective 1 year following its publication.
