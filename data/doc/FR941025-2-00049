SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated October 13, 1994, the President amended the cost-sharing arrangements
concerning the Federal funds provided under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency
Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 

et seq

.), in a letter to James L. Witt, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as follows:





I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of Georgia, resulting from torrential rain, high wind,
tornadoes and flooding resulting from Tropical Storm Alberto on July 3 through July 25, 1994, is of sufficient severity
and magnitude that special conditions are warranted regarding the cost-sharing arrangements concerning Federal
funds provided under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act'')
for the Public Assistance program.

Therefore, I amend my previous declaration to authorize Federal funds for Public Assistance at 90 percent of total
eligible costs. This 90 percent reimbursement applies to all authorized Public Assistance costs, including debris
removal to eliminate immediate threats to public health and safety, emergency work to save lives and protect public
health and safety, and repair or reconstruction of uninsured public and private non-profit facilities.

This adjustment to State and local cost sharing applies only to Public Assistance costs eligible for such adjustment
under the law. The law specifically prohibits a similar adjustment for funds provided to States for the Individual
and Family Grant program. These funds will continue to be reimbursed at 75 percent of total eligible costs.

Please notify the Governor of the State of Georgia and the Federal Coordinating Officer of this amendment to my major
disaster declaration.
