  [Text] Kigali, Jan 26 (AFP) -- Former rebel guerrillas shot 
and wounded four demonstrators in Rwanda's capital Kigali on 
Wednesday [26 January] during a protest against the alleged 
killings of two civilians by the guerrillas, witnesses said. 
  The four protesters were wounded when about 15 fighters of 
the former rebel movement, the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), 
fired into a crowd of protesters near their barracks, the 
witnesses said. 
  Rwandan authorities said they were investigating accusations 
that RPF fighters, many of whom are to join the army under peace 
accords signed with the government in August, had killed two 
people on Sunday night. Local residents said they wounded two 
others on Tuesday night. 
  After nearly three years of civil war, the RPF agreed in 
August to join a transitional coalition government which has 
still to be sworn in. Six hundred of its former fighters, 
mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe, have been billetted in the 
capital to protect former RPF leaders who are to assume 
government posts. 
  But the already strained relations between the Tutsis, 
Rwanda's feudal rulers, and the majority Hutus have soured 
further since the RPF fighters arrived last month, political 
analysts said.
