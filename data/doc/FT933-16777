FT  02 JUL 93 / French bank head in EBRD running
THE French government plans to propose Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of
the Bank of France, as a candidate to succeed Mr Jacques Attali as president
of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Mr de Larosiere, who was managing director of the International Monetary
Fund before joining the Bank of France in 1987, is viewed as a strong
contender for the EBRD job.
His candidature follows days of lobbying by senior politicians who have been
pressing for France to retain the EBRD presidency following Mr Attali's
resignation last Friday. Mr Attali was appointed to the post as the protege
of France's Socialist president, Mr Francois Mitterrand. Mr Edouard
Balladur, the conservative prime minister, is thought to have championed the
choice of Mr de Larosiere as the French candidate.
However, he is expected to face stiff competition for the job, notably from
Mr Henning Christopherson, the popular European Community economics
commissioner, who has already been confirmed as a candidate.
