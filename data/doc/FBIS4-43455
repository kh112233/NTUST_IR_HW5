  [Begin recording] Domestic political and economic 
developments as well as the whole spectrum of international 
issues were the subject of the meeting between Prime Minister 
Andreas Papandreou and President Konstandinos Karamanlis at noon 
today in the Presidential Palace. As the prime minister said, 
the meeting lasted for one hour and, as always, it was held in a 
friendly atmosphere. 
  Mr. Papandreou briefed the president on the EU summit to be 
held in Corfu and the topics to be discussed. He also briefed 
Mr. Karamanlis on his intention to proceed with a government 
reshuffle which he scheduled for after the Corfu summit. 
  The prime minister also spoke to correspondents about the 
U.S. State Department's statement, according to which Greece is 
not entitled to a 10-mile national airspace but only six miles, 
the limit of its territorial waters. Responding to a question 
from a correspondent, the prime minister said that this has 
always been the U.S. position. Mr. Papandreou added: However, 
it has been historically established that we have a 10-mile 
airspace and not six miles, the limit of our territorial waters. 
This is something that is not going to change. [end recording]
