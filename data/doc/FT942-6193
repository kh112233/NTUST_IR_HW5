FT  01 JUN 94 / Chaos feared from tighter air cargo checks
Security regulations on the shipment of air cargo which take effect today
could delay exports and cause chaos at airports, a large freight-forwarding
company claims. Only one in eight of cargo agents is thought to be able to
meet the new rules.
New security rules have been brought in partly in response to the bombing of
a Pan Am Boeing 747 over Lockerbie. They require the registration of air
cargo agents with the threat of delays for shipments sent by unapproved
companies.
MSAS Cargo International, the second-largest UK freight forwarder, said that
confusion about the new regulations had meant that many agents and airlines
had not yet invested in the x-ray equipment which would be needed, nor had
they trained their staff to hand-search cargo.
MSAS also said shippers faced the prospect of additional charges to carry
out cargo screening.
The Aviation and Security (Air Cargo Agents) Regulations, which were brought
in after three years of consultation with the industry, establish the
concept of 'listed agents', who are approved and registered by the
Department of Transport.
Listed agents can in turn declare shippers to be 'known customers' if they
are reputable, regular exporters which operate from secure sites.
Cargo sent by known customers and listed agents can be shipped without
stringent security checks, but other cargoes must be x-rayed or
hand-searched. If this is not possible then the cargo must be held for the
duration of the planned flight, plus two hours, but with a minimum wait of
12 hours.
Mail and courier parcels which are less than  1/4 inch thick are exempt.
The Department of Transport said the June deadline had been known since last
September.
It also said that about 110 of an estimated 800 agents have achieved listed
status, and more were applying.
