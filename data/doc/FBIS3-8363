  [Excerpts] [Announcer Lydia Mrazova] The Slovak Cabinet, 
led by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, is holding a regular 
meeting in Bratislava today. The Cabinet is due to discuss more 
than 30 issues. According to the Slovak Republic News Agency 
[TASR], the prime minister said the government would discuss 
personnel issues today, and it would assess also the nominees to 
the post of minister of foreign affairs and minister for the 
administration and privatization of national property. Michal 
Tvarozek reports from the Government's Office about the meeting 
so far. 
  [Tvarozek] The aforementioned issues have not gotten onto 
the 
agenda so far. Jozef Tuchyna, minister of the interior, and 
Ondrej Hanko, director of the [Government] Press and Information 
Department, took part in a short news briefing, which ended 
about 25 minutes ago. 
  Mr. Hanko provided a brief summary of the meeting so far. He 
said that the prime minister first briefed the Cabinet members 
on his talks with the Party of the Democratic Left on 7 March, 
adding that the results were confidential. Hanko went on to say 
that the government had adopted a resolution entrusting Deputy 
Prime Ministers Sergej Kozlik and Julius Toth to draft proposals 
on the use of the Japanese loan for small and medium-sized 
enteprise. [passage omitted] 
  [Tvarozek] Minister Jozef Tuchyna said afterwards: 
  [Begin recording] [Tuchyna] The last item we discussed was 
the report on the work of the joint [Czech-Slovak] border 
delimitation commission submitted on behalf of the Slovak side 
by the commission's chairman, Mr. (Becka). This report was not 
adopted in its entirety. Regarding the incorporation of the 
settlement of Sidonia in the area of the village of Horne Srnie 
and compensation for this, the government decided not to 
incorporate it into the Czech Republic. [passage omitted] 
  [Hanko] Representative of PRACE, if you please. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to know what the 
border delimination commission will do next and whether this 
issue will be returned to the government again. 
  [Tuchyna] The border delimitation commission has worked in a 
particular way, but now it is a matter for talks between the 
governments. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to ask about the 
reasons that led the government to decide not to add Sidonia to 
the Czech Republic or to a village in the Czech Republic. 
  [Tuchyna] It was simple. The vote taken by the government 
rejected this proposal. [end recording]
