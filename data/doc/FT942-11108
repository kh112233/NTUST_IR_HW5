FT  06 MAY 94 / Survey of The Channel Tunnel (23): Much more than a physical
union - Maurice Druon, veteran French writer and politician, calls for a new
intimacy in UK-French relations
When Nero began digging the Corinth Canal with a golden spade and Napoleon
the Third, in a silken tent, inaugurated the Suez Canal, they opened new
avenues between nations. Their feat went beyond the mere shortening of trade
routes; they narrowed the gulf between cultures.
In presiding over the opening of the Tunnel, Queen Elizabeth II and
President Francois Mitterrand will perform an act of parallel significance.
Now it is not two seas which are being connected but two land masses, two
countries.
This is a brilliant example of mankind's power over the elements. Equally
remarkable is political will power that brought it about.
The idea of uniting French and British soil has a long history. The two
lands were not always geographically separate. Some 10,000-12,000 years ago,
there was no sea between them. People could walk across, although with
frozen feet since this was the end of the last Ice Age.
Ten thousand years is an eternity in human terms, but a very short time in
the earth's history. Much nearer our time, some 3,000 years ago, France was
already a transit route for commodities from Britain. Cornish tin was
carried through Burgundy and down the Rhone Valley to be mingled with copper
from Cyprus in the bronze foundries of Crete. What a feat of haulage] I am
struck by it whenever I see a piece of ancient bronze.
The EU is not the first community to which we have belonged. Caesar and
Claudius shackled us with a first Treaty of Rome. It left us with our
straight highways, our French legal system and the small red bricks of
English villages.
The battle of Hastings was really only a family afffair between Norman
cousins. Had it not been for Joan of Arc, Henry VI would have ruled from
Paris and Britain would have been a French province.
For four and a half centuries France and England have quarreled like two
country landowners. Our fence was a wall of water. We carried on our
vendetta far and wide. We strove for mastery of Europe; we battled for our
rival empires.
At the same time, we never ceased wooing and seducing each other, of
dreaming about marriage, or at least of having an affair.
Montesquieu lectured us about the political virtues of England. Hogarth's
uncouth squires eventually became refined by contact with French manners.
Good British families ordered French governesses for their children. French
families employed English nurses.
The French imported golf and whisky. The English imported the jeu de paume,
and then re-exported it to France as tennis. The English taste for claret
started with the Black Prince. It was followed by a weakness for champagne
and cognac.
That cautious betrothal, the Entente Cordiale, was arranged 90 years ago,
just in time for the two families to bear the burden of 1914-1918 together.
Trafalgar still stuck in the throats of the French and the Royal navies,
with disastrous and tragic consequences in 1940. But there was also Free
France and the Free French, and the debt they incurred to Britain, together
with all Europe's Resistance fighters, for its stubborn, unflagging and
matchless heroism.
It was indeed Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle, those arrogant,
argumentative father figures, who arranged the marriage through their
stormy, grudging respect for each other. Weddings between nations are not
floral occasions. The contracts are sealed only after bitter discussions.
And the honeymoons are spoiled by clouds and storms. But Churchill and de
Gaulle contributed their lucid visions of the future.
Europe was beginning to take shape. The fixed link will be one of the jewels
in Europe's crown, uniting its north and its south.
The idea of the Tunnel is two centuries old. Dozens of separate schemes have
been proposed. Borings have been sunk and abandoned. But it proved harder to
drill through psychological barriers than through the hardest rock strata.
A key date was November 17, 1973, when Georges Pompidou and Edward Heath
signed the first treaty on the Tunnel. The mental gulf had been spanned -
the land route between Great Britain and Europe had been agreed. The next
milestone was July 29, 1987, when the final accord was ratified by the
leaders of Britain and France.
One of the most important elements in this gigantic enterprise is that, over
the years, so many individuals in France and Britain were committed to its
fulfilment. Diplomats, financiers, industrialists, administrators,
engineers, experts, technicians of all kinds, foremen and workmen - all
pulled together to remove the obstacles encountered on their long road
beneath the waves.
They exchanged their skills and their know-how; they became accustomed to
each other's behaviour; they pooled their national assets.
I regret the choice of 'Le Shuttle' as the official name of this new mode of
transport. I would have preferred the words 'shuttle' and 'navette' to sit
side by side like the heraldic arms of two families united by marriage.
I am told that 'shuttle' was adopted to please the English. Is that true?
Our cross-Channel cousins also collect foreign words. Fowler's Modern
English Usage shows that, like us, they sometimes overdo it. Yet good and
correct use of our languages is the best way to safeguard our joint
civilisation.
The fixed link will encourage an exchange of lifestyle and patterns of
thinking even more than the transfer of goods. In recent decades the French
have adopted Le weekend, in deed as well as verbally. We used to attend Mass
in our Sunday best. But the term s'endimancher has disappeared. Nowadays, a
French middle class family spends Sunday in tweeds and corduroys and the Day
of Rest goes on for two or even three days.
I would like the British to acquire some of our French attitudes towards
intellectual pursuits, and to stop fighting shy of showing a little culture,
since generally they are much more cultured and erudite than they pretend to
be. Do they give this impression because of embarrassment - or mere
stinginess? After all, it is by sharing one's own knowledge that one
enriches others.
For their part, the French need to emulate English people's innate feeling
of superiority at simply being English and subjects of Her Majesty. What an
asset in coping with life's surprises. 'I did not fulfil my life's
ambitions; I have a humdrum job; but yes I am English, a privilege which
nothing can take from me ..'
We should all have some of that pride and self-assurance, that certainty of
one's own identity. Because, wherever we turn, the outlook is worrying. To
the south of the Mediterranean, where we have some influence, we see
unchecked population growth and seething hatreds. Africa, scourged by
massacres, is disintegrating. Asia has become conscious of its size.
Germany is swelling and rediscovering its instinct for hegemony: it has
discarded the pointed helmet but now wields the mighty Deutsche Mark. The
Balkans are ablaze. Russia will somehow regain its power: in her
tribulations she needs it, and hankers for it. And the United States,
despite all its appearance of power, has become a riven society.
France and Britain must be sure of themselves and their priorities. We must
ensure that we are the vanguard of a Europe of Nations and that we are not
submerged by it. Together we must weather the storms, of which we know
nothing except that they are inevitable.
In this spirit, let us salute the fixed link as one of the greatest
accomplishments of our age, as a bulwark and beacon of hope.
