  [Text] Kosice, east Slovakia, Dec 15 (CTK) -- Almost 300 
people have already been hospitalized in Kosice with viral 
hepatitis A, city health officials said today. 
  On Tuesday the number of patients was reported to be about 
150. 
  Most of the victims are men aged 15 to 35 and children aged 
ten to fourteen, of which there are 64. 
  Individual cases of jaundice have also been reported in the 
Kosice-Venkov district among people who daily commute to Kosice. 
  Because of the large number of cases, several clinics in two 
hospitals had to be used temporarily as infectious disease 
wards, and the dormitory of the Central Health School had to be 
turned into a temporary hospital. 
  The cause of the epidemic has not yet been determined, but 
health officials do not think it was caused by contaminated city 
water or by products of the local dairy. 
  The chairman of the Kosice District Council has closed all 
basic and secondary schools in Kosice. Large gatherings have 
also been forbidden. Fish and packaged groceries sold in public 
places are subject to strict health regulations. 
  In 1979, 3,000 people in Kosice were afflicted by jaundice.
