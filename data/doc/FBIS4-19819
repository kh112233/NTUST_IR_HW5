BFN 

  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- 1993 was the year of the money 
forgers. The improving quality of color copying machines has 
led to a surge in the production of counterfeit banknotes. The 
number of forged banknotes registered by the Bundesbank reached 
a total of 41,838, which is three times as much as in 1992, when 
14,057 counterfeit bills were discovered. The value of the 
forged banknotes rose from 2.52 million German marks [DM] to 
5.73 million, the Bundesbank report notes. 
  However, in view of circulating notes and coins worth DM239 
billion by the end of 1993 -- DM224 billion in banknotes -- this 
is a relatively small share. The banknote that was most often 
forged (80 percent) was the DM100 bill. About 60 percent of all 
counterfeit bills were produced on color copying machines. 
  The imitation of DM5-coins no longer seems to be worthwhile. 
The Bundesbank only registered 8,086 forged coins in 1993 
(21,257 in 1992). Their value dropped from DM103,000 to 
DM39,000.
