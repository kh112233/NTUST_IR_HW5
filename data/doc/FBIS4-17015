  [Text] Speaking today at the pariamentary hearings on the 
country's foreign economic activities, Viktor Melnikov, head of 
the Main Directorate for Currency Regulations of the Russian 
Central Bank, quoted some interesting figures. According to 
Melnikov, at present Russian citizens have on their hands 
between 10 and 15 million U.S. dollars in cash, the purchasing 
power of which exceeds that of the total cash in rubles 
currently in circulation. Melnikov said that some of the 
reasons for such wealth of the Russians are illegal currency 
operations, tax evasion, and ever-increasing quantities of 
counterfeit dollars in circulation.
