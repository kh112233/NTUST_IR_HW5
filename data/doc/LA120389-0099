PANEL VOTES FOR LAS VEGAS SUPER TRAIN 
A bistate commission seeking to link Las Vegas with Southern California by a 
high-speed train voted 16 to 1 Saturday to proceed with plans to build the 
$4-billion project. The group set a January registration deadline for companies 
that want to build the train line. 
Ontario Mayor Howard Snider was the only dissenting member of the 
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission. He said concerns over traffic 
congestion and pollution have not been answered. 
The commission has selected Anaheim as the California terminus and is 
considering a segment linking Victorville to Palmdale.
