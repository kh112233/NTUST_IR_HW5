FT  04 MAR 92 / Asylum-seekers cost west Dollars 7bn last year
THE largest industrialised countries last year spent an overall Dollars
7bn-Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4bn-Pounds 4.58bn) on dealing with asylum-seekers
from the Third World and eastern Europe, according to informal estimates by
an international government-backed immigration secretariat in Geneva.
This is roughly one-seventh of total annual development aid made available
to the world's poorest nations by the rich western countries, which totalled
Dollars 54bn in 1990.
The total spent on asylum seekers appears to have been more than 50 per cent
higher than in 1989. This underlines the sharply growing administrative and
social security costs of processing immigrants seeking refuge in the west
from a variety of war-torn and economically distressed countries.
The main destination for asylum-seekers - above all from Romania and
Yugoslavia, as well as countries in Africa and Asia - was Europe. The 13
western European countries in the secretariat received 543,600 asylum
applications last year, up 27 per cent from the 1990 total of 426,100.
The costs of asylum include amounts spent in areas as diverse as housing,
sustenance, legal expenses and aid workers' salaries.
They cover the more than 1m people whose applications for asylum are being
dealt with by western legal and immigration authorities. Governments
generally do not like to give wide publicity to the figures, reflecting
political sensitivities in a number of countries.
In Germany - which accounts for roughly 40 per cent of all asylum requests
in the west - the latest published figure, from the Bonn Interior Ministry,
puts overall asylum costs, for 1989, at DM4bn (Pounds 2.4bn)
In view of the doubling in asylum applications in Germany during the last
three years - from 121,000 in 1989 to 256,100 last year - the actual 1991
cost was substantially higher, totalling at least Dollars 4bn, according to
estimates by German officials.
A total of 660,000 people last year applied for asylum in a group of 16
industrialised nations which constitute the main destination for migrants
fleeing from poor political or economic conditions in their homelands.
This was 22 per cent up on the total of 540,000 in 1990, according to
figures assembled by the secretariat of the 16 countries' interior
ministries, set up last summer to work on the asylum problem.
The governments are trying to find more constructive uses for the money
spent on coping with asylum seekers.
Countries such as Sweden and Germany are exploring methods of pinpointing
areas in eastern Europe, for instance, for tailor-made development aid aimed
at persuading potential immigrants to stay at home.
