BFN 

  [Text] According to Colonel Luc Marchal, the commander of 
Belgian UN forces in Kigali, the situation is relatively calm 
this morning in Kigali. A cease-fire came into force today at 
1000 between the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] and the Rwandan 
Government armed forces. The Patriotic Front has halted its 
offensive toward the capital, and the Front, he says, has only 
advanced 10 km from its initial positions in northwestern Rwanda. 
  Colonel Marchal confirmed to Valerie Hirsch that 
negotiations 
are still underway with the Rwandan Armed Forces to obtain their 
accord for the landing of Belgian forces. A parachute operation 
has been ruled out: 
  [Begin recording] [Marchal] The situation does not require 
direct intervention to protect the lives of our compatriots. 
  [Hirsch] Can you confirm that there is no hunt for Belgian 
civilians? 
  [Marchal] No, this kind of thing is not going on. 
  [Hirsch] We have reports of two Belgian civilians killed a 
few days ago. Have any more Belgians been killed this weekend? 
  [Marchal] More than two Belgians have been killed. The 
number is quite small, and those who were killed were not killed 
because they were Belgians. Most of them were killed because 
they were caught up in a combat zone or because they were caught 
in crossfire. 
  [Hirsch] How many Belgian civilians have been killed? 
  [Marchal] As far as I know, four have been killed. 
  [Hirsch] If the Belgian forces cannot arrive quickly, might 
the French evacuate Belgian civilians? 
  [Marchal] I think that anything is possible. It is clear 
that their ability to act is directly governed by the attitude 
of the Armed Forces and the gendarmerie. If they oppose it, it 
is clear that the French contingent is not large enough to carry 
out a general evacuation in decent security conditions. 
  [Hirsch] They are dealing with the French in priority, when 
it seems that the Belgians are far more threatened. 
  [Marchal] Yes. They are dealing with the French first. [end
