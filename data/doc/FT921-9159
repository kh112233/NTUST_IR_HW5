FT  13 FEB 92 / Mexico acts on pollutants
MEXICO has taken another step towards cleaning its smog-shrouded capital,
one of the world's most polluted cities, by ordering tens of thousands of
vehicles to convert to clean-burning fuels, Reuter reports from Mexico City.
Emissions from cars, trucks and buses account for nearly 80 per cent of the
more than 4,300 tonnes of pollutants dumped on Mexico City every year. Under
the new measures, owners of 144,000 public transport and cargo vehicles -
including the ageing buses and cabs  - will be forced to convert to natural
gas or liquid petroleum gas over the next three years.
During the same period, another 147,000 vehicles will be sent to the scrap
heap and substituted by newer models that run on lead-free petrol and are
equipped with catalytic convertors.
