<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Jordanian Political Activity and Good </F>
Results"] 
  [Text] Some remarkable Jordanian political activity took 
place last week. This activity emphasized Jordan's independent 
character and stressed awareness about Jordan's basic role in 
the peace process. 
  His Majesty King Husayn's visit to the United States and his 
meetings with U.S. President Clinton and senior U.S. officials 
were the major events in this activity. These meetings, whether 
on political and economic levels or on the level of bilateral 
relations, showed that the U.S. side understands the Jordanian 
role in the region as well as Jordan's democratic march and 
respect for human rights. Accordingly, the U.S. officials 
clearly responded to Jordanian demands regarding sovereignty 
over land, rights to water, and completion of the measures 
designed to lift the blockade of al-'Aqabah. 
  In an interview with Radio Monte Carlo yesterday, his 
majesty 
the leader reaffirmed Jordan's eagerness to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace which returns rights to their owners and 
removes the yolk of occupation from all occupied Arab 
territories. While Jordan is eager to regain its rights, it 
also seeks to promote the peace process on the Palestinian, 
Syrian, and Lebanese tracks. In this regard, his majesty 
indicated he was surprised by some reactions that criticized the 
Jordanian-Israeli agreement. He explained that Jordan has been 
making continuous contacts with the brothers participating in 
the peace process, and that good and acceptable coordination 
exists and continues to be fostered among these parties. 
  With regard to the economic issues, King Husayn said the 
U.S. 
Administration understood Jordan's demands, whether in terms of 
economic aid, indebtedness, or the extension of aid that would 
contribute to constructing and promoting Jordan and securing a 
decent life for the Jordanian citizen, who is our most precious 
property.
