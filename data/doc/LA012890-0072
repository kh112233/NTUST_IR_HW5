WALL SHOULD GO TO WASTE, PARTY SAYS 
Reinforced concrete slabs from the Berlin Wall should be used for building 
silos and manure storage containers, an East German political party said 
Saturday. 
Prized wall graffiti would not have to vanish if the concrete were put to such 
use, the Democratic Peasants Party's official newspaper said. 
"Valuable paintings would certainly face outward and would thus be maintained 
for future generations," the paper said. "Why shouldn't villages also have such 
a tourist attraction?" 
Since Communist authorities opened the wall Nov. 9 after 28 years, East German 
officials have said the border barrier will be dismantled and sold by the slab 
to foreigners paying hard currency. 
East German border guards removed a first 320-yard stretch of the 100-mile wall 
in West Berlin last week and carted the pieces off to a depot.
