FT  21 AUG 93 / Rexrodt hopeful after VW talks
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, said after meeting senior
Volkswagen executives yesterday that he was hopeful the heated dispute
between the German carmaker and General Motors of the US could be resolved
in a less public fashion, Reuter reports from Berlin.
He met Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and Mr Klaus Liesen, supervisory
board chairman, for over an hour. He had a similar meeting on Tuesday with
the chairman of GM's German subsidiary, Adam Opel. He will meet them again
next week.
The dispute surrounds the move to VW of GM production chief Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, taking several GM managers with him. Opel alleges the
former GM managers took industrial secrets with them.
