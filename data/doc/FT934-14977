FT  14 OCT 93 / Argentina hopeful over Falklands poll
THE Falkland Islands go to the polls today, with a record 25 candidates
competing for the eight seats on the local council.
The elections are arousing particular interest in Argentina, which fought a
74-day war over the Falklands with Britain in 1982, and still claims
sovereignty over the islands.
Mr Guido di Tella, Argentina's foreign minister, claims the elections will
bring a more 'enlightened' group of councillors to power who will be more
willing to talk to Argentina.
However, the chances are that such hopes will be disappointed. None of the
candidates, who run as individuals rather than under the party banner, is
willing to have more contact with Argentina than is strictly necessary until
it drops its sovereignty claim.
