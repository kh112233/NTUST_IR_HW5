P. M. BRIEFING; 
CUBA ATTRACTS 13% MORE TOURISTS 
About 225,000 foreign tourists visited Cuba last year, a 13% rise over 1987, 
according to National Tourist Board figures published today. 
They included 31,000 visitors from socialist countries. 
That share has remained stable over the last few years, and the government has 
launched an ambitious development plan to attract more hard-currency tourists 
with the aim of luring 600,000 visitors from the Western world by 1991. 
The travel board said earnings increased 20% over 1987. It gave no exact 
figures, but that increase would mean that hard-currency income from tourism 
topped $120 million. 
The official target is to have this revenue grow tenfold by the year 2000, 
which would then make tourism the island's top hard-currency earner.
