  [Text] Bogota, 23 Feb (EFE) -- Authorities have reported 
that Jaime Orejuela Caballero, one of the most important bosses 
of the drug-trafficking Cali Cartel, a man wanted by the United 
States, was arrested Tuesday by the Colombian police in a Cali 
neighborhood. According to Cali Police Chief General Jose 
Eustasio Reyes, his men captured 50-year-old Orejuela Caballero 
while he was driving his automobile in a Cali suburb. 
  Orejuela, who was transferred by plane to Bogota, is wanted 
by Interpol and could be transferred to the United States 
although no official announcement has been made about 
extradition plans. Gen. Reyes reported that a New York City 
court has filed an arrest warrant for the Colombian mafia boss, 
who is accused of possessing, producing, and distributing 
cocaine in NYC. He faces other charges also. 
  A few hours before the arrest, Colombia's Prosecutor General 
Gustavo De Greiff said in the city of Medellin, which is the 
headquarters of another notorious drug-traffic cartel, 
negotiations for the surrender of Cali Cartel chiefs are under 
way. The prosecutor general said the possible surrender of 
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Julio Fabio Urdinola Grajales, 
two alleged bosses of the Cali Cartel, is being negotiated. 
  Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez told De Greiff in a letter 
that he is afraid there could be "legal maneuvers" behind the 
efforts of the drug-traffickers' attorneys, which are geared 
toward allowing the authorities to investigate the accused, then 
finding them not guilty due to a lack of evidence in Colombia. 
  According to the U.S. DEA, the Cali Cartel is Colombia's 
most 
important mafia group, more important than the almost dismantled 
Medellin Cartel, which controls 80 percent of the cocaine 
shipments to the United States.
