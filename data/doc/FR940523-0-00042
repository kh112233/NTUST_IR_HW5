 

FDA has also evaluated the information submitted by Calgene concerning soil microorganisms and agrees with Calgene
that there would be no increase in kanamycin-resistant soil microorganisms because it is highly unlikely that the


kan



r

 gene could move from the plant genome into soil microorganisms via horizontal gene transfer. Further, the agency
has determined that, even if such transfer could occur, the rate at which it could occur is such that it would not result
in a detectable increase over the existing background population of kanamycin-resistant bacteria (Ref. 36). Based
on the foregoing, FDA has concluded that the use of the 

kan



r

 gene does not pose safety concerns in terms of increase in the population of antibiotic-resistant pathogens due to
the potential for horizontal transfer of the gene.


IV. Response to Comments


FDA received 47 comments on Calgene's request for an advisory opinion on the use of the 

kan



r

 gene in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton plants. Comments were received from members
of academia, industry and industry-related organizations, State and Federal agencies, environmental groups and
other nonprofit organizations, and individual consumers. Additionally, several comments on the agency's 1992
policy statement addressed the use of the 

kan



r

 gene.
Most of the comments supported the use of the 

kan



r

 gene in crop development, stating that there were no health or environmental issues precluding its use. Several comments
expressed opinions on a wide range of issues including regulatory approaches for genetically engineered foods,
concerns relating to human and animal food safety, and to the environmental effects of the 

kan



r

 gene, and whether foods containing the 

kan



r

 gene and APH(3
&rsquo;)II should be specially labeled.


A. Regulatory Issues


Some comments stated that it was not appropriate for FDA to evaluate the safety of the 

kan



r

 gene and APH(3
&rsquo;)II under an advisory opinion and that the 

kan



r

 gene and APH(3
&rsquo;)II should be treated as food additives by FDA. FDA has discussed above the basis for its decision not to regulate
the DNA that makes up the 

kan



r

 gene itself as a food additive. Further, in light of Calgene's conversion of its request for advisory opinion on the
use of the 

kan



r

 gene to a food additive petition, the comment concerning the regulation of APH(3
&rsquo;)II as a food additive no longer requires a response.


B. Food Safety


Several comments stated that the presence in food of APH(3
&rsquo;)II raised no food safety concerns whatsoever. Others questioned whether Calgene had supplied adequate
data to ensure the safety of the 

kan



r

 gene and gene product, APH(3
&rsquo;)II, when present in food. The substantive questions raised are discussed in sections IV.B.1 through 5 of
this document.


1. Glycosylation


Two comments stated that APH(3
&rsquo;)II might be glycosylated (i.e., might contain sugar molecules attached to the protein via the amino acid
asparagine (N-linked) or via the amino acids serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline (O-linked)) when produced in
tomatoes or other plants and, therefore, might become a food allergen. One of the comments asserted that for this reason,
Calgene should be required to test whether APH(3
&rsquo;)II is glycosylated. The comments, however, did not provide any information showing that glycosylated APH(3
&rsquo;)II is likely to be, or is, allergenic.
At this time, FDA is unaware of any practical method to predict or assess the potential for new proteins in food to induce
allergenicity. Although many food allergens that have been characterized at a structural level are glycosylated
(Ref. 37), the agency is not aware of any information on structural or other properties of glycosylated proteins that
would be predictive of their allergenicity. As noted, the comments did not provide such information. Moreover, glycosylated
proteins are widespread in food. For these reasons, glycosylation is not a useful positive predictor of a potential
allergenic effect. Accordingly, FDA did not request that Calgene determine whether APH(3
&rsquo;)II is glycosylated.
Nevertheless, in a submission dated October 24, 1991, entitled ``Response to Public Comments,'' Calgene addressed
whether APH(3
&rsquo;)II is likely to be glycosylated and concluded that it is not. Calgene noted that APH(3
&rsquo;)II lacks the amino terminal sequence of amino acids (commonly referred to as a ``signal peptide'') that is
necessary to direct the protein into the cellular compartments where glycosylation occurs. Calgene also asserted
that the unchanged molecular weight of APH(3
&rsquo;)II in plants (relative to the molecular weight of bacterial APH(3
&rsquo;)II, which is not glycosylated) supports the conclusion that APH(3
&rsquo;)II is not glycosylated in plants. Finally, Calgene stated that the amino acid sequence (asparagine-X-serine/threonine)
that is required to direct N-linked glycosylation to specific asparagine moieties is not present in APH(3
&rsquo;)II. (Calgene noted that a corresponding argument for the lack of the appropriate amino acid sequence to direct
O-linked glycosylation cannot be made because the sequences that direct O-linked glycosylation have not been defined.)
FDA has considered the information and arguments submitted in the comments and Calgene's response and has concluded
that the available evidence indicates that APH(3
&rsquo;)II is not glycosylated in plants. However, even if glycosylation had been demonstrated, FDA emphasizes
that glycosylation alone does not necessarily establish that APH(3
&rsquo;)II is likely to produce an allergenic response because the positive predictive value of glycosylation with
respect to the potential for inducing allergenicity has not been demonstrated.
