NATION IN BRIEF; 
WASHINGTON, D.C.; 
BARBARA BUSH HAS 2ND EYE TREATMENT 
First Lady Barbara Bush underwent her second of 10 radiation treatments, a 
process that doctors hope will eliminate eye problems associated with a thyroid 
condition. Mrs. Bush suffers from Graves' disease, a thyroid ailment that has 
caused bloodshot eyes and double vision. 
Two other types of treatments have not been successful and doctors hope to 
avoid surgery. The latest treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center involves 
bombarding her inflamed eye sockets with radiation to reduce muscle swelling. 
Anna Perez, the First Lady's press secretary, said Mrs. Bush felt "just fine." 
Perez said Mrs. Bush is "not losing her eyesight" from the disease and the 
radiation has not affected her vision.
