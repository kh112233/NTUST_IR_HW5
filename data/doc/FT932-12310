FT  29 APR 93 / Reforms planned to improve success rate
THE World Bank will introduce reforms to try to reverse a steady
deterioration in the success rate of its projects, Mr Lewis Preston, the
bank's president, said yesterday.
Mr Preston was referring to the findings of an internal review of project
performance by a task-force headed by Mr Willi Wapenhans, a senior bank
official.
The Wapenhans report, which the bank has not yet published, found 'a gradual
but steady deterioration in the World Bank's portfolio performance.'
The number of projects 'judged unsatisfactory at completion' had risen from
15 per cent in fiscal 1981 to 30.5 per cent in fiscal 1989 and 37.5 per cent
in fiscal 1991.
It said problems were concentrated in Africa and Latin America but other
regions 'also had 30-40 per cent of problem projects in their 4-5 year old
portfolios.'
Mr Preston said he was 'disturbed' by the report because it meant
implementation of bank projects 'was not what it should be.'
However, he said critics misunderstood the meaning of the failure rate. It
was high partly because the bank set an ambitious standard for success: a 10
per cent economic rate of return. Projects that failed to meet this criteria
need not be a 'failure in terms of development.'
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, underscored the point in
congressional testimony this week and said he would press for prompt
remedial action.
