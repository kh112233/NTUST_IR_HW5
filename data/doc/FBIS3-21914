  [Text] A 30-year-old man was last night in Police custody 
following the discovery of more than 90 pounds of cocaine in two 
suitcases at the Timehri International Airport. 
  The cache was stashed in the two suitcases lined with 
bedspreads which appeared to have been saturated with a kind of 
acidic substance aimed at throwing drugs sniffer dogs deployed 
at the airport off the scent, sources said last night. 
  According to the sources, the two suitcases were checked in 
by a passenger on the BWIA noon flight out of Timehri. When 
airline officials checked the aircraft, the passenger was not on 
board and he was found in the airport Immigration area after a 
search, the sources told the CHRONICLE. 
  He was taken to the luggage after Customs officials were 
summoned and more than 90 pounds of cocaine were discovered in 
the two suitcases, the sources said. 
  The passenger held by Police has been named as Jerimiah Foy, 
who lived in the United States but is from the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, according to the sources. 
  He is to appear in Court today charged with cocaine 
trafficking, Police sources confirmed. 
  According to reports, Foy arrived here last October 20 and 
was married to a Guyanese woman several days later. 
  Honduran-born U.S. resident Gwendoline Martinez, 63, who was 
jailed last month for trying to smuggle cocaine through the 
airport, had arrived in the country on October 20, reports 
indicated. 
  The grey and balding woman was nabbed on November 19, at the 
airport, with six pounds of cocaine stashed in parcels in her 
girdle. 
  Martinez claimed she was trapped into taking the drugs to 
the 
airport and pleaded guilty. 
  She was jailed for five years.
