FT  01 JUN 94 / Business and the Environment: Animal art at auction
Paul Augustinus was in trouble. The nearest tree was an unstable sapling.
His glasses had fallen as he ran, impairing his sight. The lioness was
gaining ground.
Luckily, nature was kind. Augustinus reached the tree, it held his weight,
the lioness was distracted. And Augustinus, a wildlife painter, had yet more
material for his work.
Wildlife art can be dangerous work; the art market is waiting to see if it
is lucrative work. This Friday, in the UK's first specialist wildlife art
auction, more than 600 pieces from around the world go on auction at
Christie's in London,
The event will span three centuries of art work, capturing bird, mammal and
marine life in watercolours, oils, prints and sculptures. It follows
Christie's successful bird art auctions, first launched five years ago.
Christie's is keen to see whether the art market follows the growing
environmentalism of the 1990s. 'Where corporations want to become involved
in the environment, it may well be through having a collection of wildlife
art,' says Gregory Page-Turner, Christie's watercolour and drawings
specialist.
Conservation groups also have a vested interest. Several are entering pieces
donated to them for the auction. The groups hope to raise more money by
auction than they could through usual charitable events.
Five conservation groups will also receive a proportion of the sale price of
specific art lots. They are: the Rhino Rescue Trust, Nature in Art, the Dian
Fossey Gorilla Fund, Tusk Force Environmental Protection and BirdLife
International.
For Augustinus, with three pictures up for sale, the auction is an
opportunity to test the real market price for wildlife art - priced from
several hundred pounds to Pounds 60,000. 'Until now, galleries and artists
have determined the price - this will set the market value for future 'green
art',' he says.
