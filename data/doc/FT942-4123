Four consortia, three of which include large continental European and US
engineering groups, have been shortlisted to bid for the Pounds 2.7bn
high-speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel by the Department
of Transport. They are:
EuroRail, the only all-British bid, involving a joint venture between BICC,
Trafalgar House and GEC. The bid is supported by bankers National
Westminster and HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Seeboard, the
electricity company, yesterday said it had accepted an invitation to join
the consortium.
London &amp; Continental Railways, involving UK consulting engineers Ove Arup
and Sir William Halcrow, Bechtel, the large US construction group,
Sofrerail, the French transport consultants, UK coach company National
Express, cement group Blue Circle and merchant bank SG Warburg.
A consortium led by Hochtief, the German construction group, supported by UK
construction and engineering group Costain, Nishimatsu Construction of
Japan, Siemens and Siemens Transport Systems of Germany, and Westinghouse,
the US engineering group.
A joint venture between UK construction groups John Mowlem and Taylor
Woodrow, the German construction company Philipp Holzmann, Transurb
Consultants of Belgium, and WS Atkins, the UK consulting engineers.
The rail link will run for 68 miles from Folkestone to a purpose-built
terminus at London St Pancras.
A hybrid bill authorising construction of the new line is expected to be
introduced in parliament in the autumn.
Until the new line is built European Passenger Services will operate
services to Paris and Brussels, starting this summer, from Waterloo station,
south London.
