FT  10 JUN 94 / Price-fixing in plastics admitted
The US Justice Department said yesterday it had cracked a price-fixing
conspiracy among three plastic cutlery manufacturers that controlled over 90
per cent of the Dollars 100m-a-year US market.
Following joint raids by the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, the department charged that executives at
Minnesota-based Plastics Inc, Pennsylvania-based Polar Plastics and
Massachusetts-based Comet Products had agreed in secret telephone
conversations and meetings to drive up prices on disposable cups and glasses
from December 1991 to December 1992.
The three companies have all agreed to plead guilty and will collectively
pay over Dollars 8.36m (Pounds 5.57m) in fines. Four executives charged
individually also agreed to guilty pleas and face potential imprisonment and
hefty fines.
'This is the kind of international co-operation that is urgently needed in
an age of shrinking borders and international anti-trust conspiracies,' Ms
Janet Reno, US attorney general, said.
