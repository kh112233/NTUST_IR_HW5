<H5>  Part IV </H5>
  Many kinds of materials are needed in the nuclear field. 
Therefore, research and development on a broad range of 
materials from structural materials to functional materials, and 
from metals to ceramics, is necessary. Ceramics materials, 
except for nuclear fuels, are not at the stage of practical use 
for the current generation of nuclear plants. However, the use 
of ceramics as materials for specific uses and functions in 
nuclear systems oriented toward high-temperature, such as 
process heating high-temperature gas-cooled reactors and nuclear 
fusion reactors, has been growing in importance. For instance, 
the following uses can be considered: graphite materials for 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, coated particle fuels and 
fuels for light water reactors and fast reactors, solid blanket 
breeder materials for nuclear fusion reactors, ion-conductive 
ceramics for the tritium collection system in nuclear fusion 
reactors and hydrogen production using nuclear heat in 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, translucent and 
photo-conductive ceramics for the measuring system in nuclear 
fusion reactors, and semiconductive and piezoelectric ceramics 
for robot sensors in highly radioactive environments. 
  There are two ways to evaluate the suitability of materials 
for use in the nuclear field. One is to examine the adaptability 
of candidate materials to the nuclear environment (by examining 
their adaptability to the conditions provided by existing data, 
such as radiation, temperature, pressure, and atmosphere, and 
then confirming it by experiments). The other is to create new 
materials suitable for the nuclear environment (by designing and 
creating new materials to meet conditions for use based on 
research in production, structure, and solid state properties, 
and then confirming it by experiments). Based on the recent 
research principle that it is necessary to consider designing on 
the atomic and molecular levels to create radiation-resistant 
ceramics for nuclear use, there have been a number of 
experiments designed to realize new materials created using 
molecular dynamics computer simulation with artificial lattice 
formation technology, such as a molecular beam epitaxy method, 
and to verify the results by experiments with radiation. 
  This section introduces a number of new materials 
development 
technologies based on nuclear reactor fuel research. These 
include ceramics compound technology using the sol-gel process, 
the use of transient metal carbides as ultra-high-temperature 
materials, and research on actinoid compounds. As part of the 
search for functional materials, the study and use of 
ultra-ion-conductor ceramics and new glass materials, as well as 
the application of computer simulation are described. 
<H5>  1. Nuclear Reactor Fuel and New Materials </H5>
<H5>  (1) Fine Ceramics Science and Nuclear Reactor Fuel </H5>
  The history of commercial nuclear reactor fuels overlaps 
with 
the history of fine ceramics science, which began about 1950. 
Research on the development of uranium dioxide started in the 
transition period from the classical ceramics industry, which 
was based on natural minerals, to the fine ceramics industry, 
which is based on characteristic-controlled compound materials, 
and progressed by absorbing its results immediately. In some 
aspects, it led the fine ceramics industry. Since the results of 
oxide fuel research, which started in the United States and 
Britain, were translated to the area of general ceramics, many 
of them are not informed directly. A search for various compound 
processes, compositions to meet specific use conditions, and 
design and control of micro-organisms are required for the 
development of advanced materials. Research and development of 
nuclear reactor fuel and fuel elements is an area where these 
factors must be taken into account. 
  Although there are options for light-water reactor fuel that 
feature improved burning characteristics, plutonium recycling, 
and burn up processing, there are many aspects of oxide fuel 
that require research and development from the standpoint of new 
materials development. At the same time, long-term objectives 
beyond the current generation of light-water reactors requires 
the elaboration of nonoxide fuels (nitride, carbide oxide), as 
well as research and development on new ceramic coating 
materials. In this area, technological development is in 
progress both for production process and characterization. Such 
technology may possibly be applied to new materials development 
in general beyond nuclear reactor fuel. 
<H5>  (2) New Development of Sol-Gel Process </H5>
  At present, oxide fuels for light water reactors and fast 
reactors are produced by the powder formation method. However, 
research to simplify this process based on a wet method has been 
conducted at various places in conjunction with work to process 
collected reprocessing fuel. So-called "sol-gel process" was 
devised at Oak Ridge National Research Center of the United 
States, and began to spread to ceramics production in general. 
  A general advantage of the sol-gel process is its 
flexibility 
in managing the shape, composition, and properties of products. 
This process makes it possible to form ultra-micro-monodisperse 
powder as well as relatively large integrally molded pieces for 
shape, to mix components on an extremely small scale for 
composition, and to control density as well as porosity for 
properties. This is the reason why the sol-gel process has come 
to be applied extensively in areas outside nuclear reactor fuel. 
  It is not easy to define the sol-gel process clearly. In the 
narrow sense, it is a process to turn (1) a suspension (sol) of 
metal compound particles as a starting material (2) into an 
intermediate material by livering, and (3) to acquire ceramic 
products by burning it. The method used at JAERI to compound 
thorium oxide fuel microspheres is equivalent to a typical 
sol-gel process. 
  With the method used at JAERI, a thoria sol is produced by 
adding ammonia gas to a thorium nitrate solution. A feature of 
this method is to control the development process of colloidal 
particles in the sol by adjusting the pH of the solution. An 
effective way to prevent cracks and deformation of microspheres 
by shrinkage in the subsequent gelling process is to increase 
the size of colloidal particles in the sol and to increase the 
colloidal content (Figure IV-1). Micro gel spheres obtained this 
way are transformed to high-density microspheres of 
ThO[.sup]2[/] and (Th, U)O[.sub]2[/] by thermal processing. 



  The particle size of microspheres can be controlled by 
changing the dropping conditions, such as the nozzle size. 
Particles with a diameter of several hundred m are coated 
with ceramics and used as coated particle fuel for 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors. Smaller particles with a 
diameter of about 150 m (Figure IV-2) can be compounded and 
used as a material for the gel particle pressure mold method to 
produce high-density pellets. In the latter case, drying water 
in gel particles after replacement with alcohol produces soft 
microspheres with a stable pore structure. Using these 
microspheres as a material for pressure molding, thorium nitrate 
high-density fuel pellets over 96 percent TD can be obtained at 
a low sintering temperature of 1,300C. 



  In the sol-gel process, in a broader sense, the sol stage is 
often omitted. In the case of UO[.sup]2[/][.sup]+2[/] 
ions, a highly concentrated sol cannot be formed unless 
U[.sup]+6[/] is reduced to U[.sup]+4[/]. Therefore, the 
nitrate solution generally is transformed directly to the gel 
without going through the sol stage. Creation of viscosity, by 
adding a suitable polymer to a uranyl nitrate solution, 
facilitates the stable formation of droplets. Gel spheres can be 
obtained by processing the droplets with ammonia. 
UO[.sup]2[/] microspheres to be used as coated particle fuel 
for high-temperature gas-cooled reactors are manufactured by 
Atomic Fuel Industries in such a process. In this method, 
droplets are formed in an ammonia gas atmosphere, and are gelled 
by dropping them into ammonia water. This method of working with 
ammonia externally is called the external gelling method. 
  As already stated, one of the characteristics of the sol-gel 
process is ease of composition management. As an example of the 
application of the external gelling method, UO[.sup]2[/] 
particles supplemented with ZrC, SiC, etc. as oxygen getters or 
simulated fission products have been produced experimentally, 
and have been used as fuel behavior test pieces in laboratories. 
  In contrast to the external gelling method, with the 
internal 
gelling method, gel particles are obtained by adding materials 
that generate ammonia when heated -- such as hexamethylene 
tetramine (HMTA) and urea -- to a nitrate solution, and then 
dropping this solution into some heating medium. At JAERI, the 
internal gelling method has been developed as a compound method 
for nonoxide fuels. In this case, a correct amount of carbon 
powder is added to the solution to obtain gel spheres that 
firmly combine oxide and carbon. It is possible to obtain 
carbides (UC, UC[.sup]2[/]), and carbide oxides (UCO), by 
heating them in a vacuum. It is also possible to obtain nitrides 
by heating in a nitrogen-hydrogen mixed stream. 
  As an option to process transuranic elements (TRU) such as 
neptunium and americium, concepts for a TRU annihilation 
disposal reactor and its fuel cycle have been examined. In order 
for annihilation disposal to be valid, it is essential to 
minimize actinide loss of the fuel cycle as a whole. It is 
possible to minimize the loss in the fuel processing stage by 
applying the sol-gel process properly as a fuel compound method. 
In this case, direct compounding of microspheres of fuel 
materials without involving powder is an important advantage. 
However, application to TRU will require experimental validation 
to ensure against the possibility of the stock solution becoming 
unstable due to heat produced by serious _a_ decay. 
  The alkoxide gelling method is a sol-gel process in the 
broad 
sense, and has been noted as a compound method for producing 
monodisperse oxide powder and a special glass body. We have 
developed the technology to compound dystetic transition metal 
carbides such as ZrC, TiC, and ZrB[.sup]2[/], borides and 
their compounds based on the alkoxide gelling method. Metal 
alkoxide is hydrolyzed in a carbon-suspended liquid to produce a 
tight compound gel of oxide and carbon. By heating the gel in a 
vacuum, a soft carbon aggregate can be obtained. This aggregate 
can be shattered to particles with a diameter of about 100 nm by 
radiating it with ultrasonic waves for a short time. An 
important point in its process is the selection of materials to 
match the isoelectric point of metal oxide and carbon, as well 
as implementing hydrolysis near the isoelectric point. This 
makes it possible to incorporate carbon particles into the 
network of oxide particles. 
  Transient metal carbide and boride have a number of useful 
characteristics, such as high fusion points, low relative 
density, and high strength. Thus their application can be 
expanded to high-temperature structural materials, and to 
coating materials. Micropowders with a high degree of 
dispersibility by the alkoxide gelling method can be used as a 
material powder for plasma coating. 
<H5>  (3) New Type of Coated Particle Fuel and Application </H5>
  The basic unit of high-temperature gas-cooled reactor fuel 
is 
a coated fuel particle with a diameter at about 1mm. Each 
particle is an oxide fuel microsphere with four layers of 
coating of low-density thermal decomposition carbon, 
high-density thermal decomposition carbon, silicon carbide 
(SiC), and high-density thermal decomposition carbon. The four 
layers of coating serve to protect each other, and also function 
together as a pressurized container for nuclear fission 
products. For instance, the low-density carbon layer functions 
as a gas plenum, and protects the outer layer from fission 
fragments. The SiC layer functions as a diffusion barrier 
against metal fission products such as Cs and Sr. The coating is 
made by the high-temperature chemical vaporization method, while 
fuel particles are mixed in a sprouted bed. 
  The concept of a coated particle fuel is a technology 
designed to achieve high burn up at high temperatures that 
cannot be achieved by other fuel types, and the expansion of its 
applications to take advantage of its properties has been 
examined. At JAERI, research and development on a coated 
particle fuel with a zirconium carbide (ZrC) layer instead of 
the SiC layer has been conducted. 
  The ZrC coated layer is formed by the reaction of zirconium 
halide and carbon hydride also in the sprouted bed. While SiC 
decomposes in a short time at temperatures over 2,200 K, ZrC is 
hard to melt, having a fusion point at 3,693 K. ZrC, as an 
intermetal compound of transient metals, has higher 
intergranular stability than SiC, which has an inherent 
intergranular instability as a covalent compound semiconductor. 
Use of the ZrC coated particle fuel in a test fuel assembly for 
the high-temperature engineering test reactor is being 
considered. Furthermore, another system to utilize the superior 
heat resistance of ZrC-coated particle fuel is space nuclear 
reactors. 
  Nuclear reactors in space can be used for power generation 
and propulsion power for stations, a moon base, and deep space 
exploration. Processing of waste heat is a big problem for space 
power generating reactors, and improved efficiency in 
radiational cooling is a key to the reduction of the system to a 
size appropriate for space development. In the concept shown in 
Figure IV-3, heat is led to the thermo-electric converter 
through lithium heat pipes that are laid to a core consisting of 
a layer filled with ZrC coated fuel particles. It is desirable 
to raise the operational temperature, and, therefore, the fuel 
temperature as much as possible to improve radiational cooling 
efficiency. 



  Further, nuclear heat-propelled rockets for manned space 
exploration requires a fuel temperature as high as 2,400C. 
However, in this case, the required integrated burn up time and 
burn up rate are smaller. Figure IV-4 illiterates the results of 
heating ZrC coated fuel particles produced experimentally for 
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors to 2,400C after 
irradiation. Although ordinary SiC-coated fuel particles were 
mostly destroyed before reaching 2,400C, ZrC-coated fuel 
particles were maintained at 2,400C without being damaged. 




  Another area of possible application of coated particle fuel 
is in TRU extinction processing. The possibility of compounding 
fuel microspheres containing TRU from a group-separated TRU salt 
solution by the sol-gel process was mentioned earlier. In 
principle, such microspheres can be coated in various ways by 
the chemical evaporation method. 
  Figure IV-5 illustrates a concept for the direct cooling of 
a 
concentric cylinder made of a metal frit (net) filled with fuel 
particle consisting of TRU nitride coated with titanium nitride. 
Nitride is compatible with metals. By cooling particle fuel with 
a large relative surface area, fuel temperature is kept within 
one-third of the fusing point (about 3,000 K) of TRU nitride, 
and the transfer of fission products in the fuel material is 
controlled. This concept is designed to minimize the thickness 
of the coating needed to maintain soundness, and to achieve a 
hard-core neutron spectrum suitable for TRU fission burn up of 
TRU. It is also intended to realize high output density, or high 
nuclear transfer speed, by cooling the particles directly. 



<H5>  (4) Actinide Compounds </H5>
  The difficulty in predicting the behavior of actinide solids 
is closely related to the behavior of the 5f electron. This is 
because the degree of the effect of the 5f electron on linkage 
differs depending on the specific actinide elements, other 
elements used for alloys and compounds, and environmental 
conditions such as temperature and pressure. 
  Actinides can be divided roughly into two groups, from Th to 
Pu, and Am and beyond. In many ways, actinides beyond Am are 
similar to lanthanides. Although the concept of group separation 
as well as extinction processing of TRU has been examined at 
various places, it is noted that Np and Am, the main components 
of waste TRU, are very different from each other in their 
characteristics in the examination of fuels and targets. 
  TRU nitride, as well as alloys, is one of the hopeful 
candidates for TRU extinction processing fuels. The reason is 
that, while actinides are extremely variable in their 
characteristics as individual metals, and it is difficult to 
predict their behavior, nitrides are expected to share their 
characteristics. Therefore, the database for UN and (U, Pu)N is 
expected to be used to predict the behavior of nitride fuels 
containing TRU to a certain degree. 
  However, there is no sufficient database for UN and (U, Pu)N 
at present. There is a cooperative project between JAERI and PNC 
on irradiation testing for (U, Pu)N fuel using the Joyo reactor. 
A production technology for compound nitride pellets based on a 
powder method has almost been completed. Building on this 
technology, research on NpN compounds has begun. 
  Concerning the basic solid state properties for nitrides, 
thermal diffusion rate measurement and vapor pressure 
measurement are in progress. The evaporation behavior of 
individual nitrides is relatively simple. As UN has a lower U 
partial pressure than N[.sup]2[/] partial pressure, nitrogen 
is lost with priority, and a metal liquid phase is separated at 
high temperatures over 1,700C. Even though the evaporation 
behavior of these nitride compounds is complex, a precise 
understanding is required since the appearance of the liquid 
phase temperature defines the maximum fuel line output. 
  Using the measurement results from laboratories and 
reference 
information, we have established a system to implement routinely 
multiple-compound, multiple-phase equilibrium analysis. Figure 
IV-6 illustrates the results of an evaporation behavior analysis 
for (U, Pu)N. We plan to further develop the database for 
actinide alloys, ceramics, and fused salt. 



  Along with the increase in burn up rates and burn up ratio 
of 
plutonium, the density of precious metal fission products in 
spent fuel increases radically compared to the conventional 
fuels. In some conditions, an alloy phase such as (U, 
Pu)Pd[.sup]3[/] may appear and become a problem in 
reprocessing due to its refractory property. Research on 
actinide inter-metal compounds is an important item for future 
research. 
  Certain types of actinide inter-metal compounds are 
interesting as research objects for superconductivity and 
magnetic properties. For Pu and Np, in addition to Th and U, a 
system to implement production of various compounds and alloys 
as well as characterization is being developed. 
<H5>  2. Search and Application of Functional Materials </H5>
  In the nuclear field as well, ceramics, amorphous materials, 
and random system materials such as glass and fused salt have 
been noted as useful functional materials for special purposes. 
Various solid state properties of these materials are closely 
related to their structures, and a study of their structural 
properties is the most basic research objective in examining the 
properties of these materials. As experimental means of 
structural analysis, such methods as X-ray and neutron ray 
diffractometry, laser Raman spectroscopy, and infrared 
spectroscopy are commonly used. However, with these methods, it 
is difficult to obtain binary distribution functions between the 
constituent atoms except for special elements. On the other 
hand, it is extremely useful to apply molecular dynamics 
computer simulation, which has made rapid progress recently, to 
these random systems. For instance, although it requires massive 
amounts of time and money to obtain the solid state properties 
of fused salt only from experiments, supplementing such efforts 
with computer simulation helps predict an optimum material 
system with target property values. 
  In this section, we will discuss ultra-ion-conductive 
materials as examples of ceramic functional materials, as well 
as research on fluoride glass, which is useful in the infrared 
range, and structural property evaluation by molecular dynamics 
computer simulation as examples of random system. 
<H5>  (1) Ultra-Ion-Conductive Materials </H5>
  There are materials that are solid and capable of 
transferring only specific constituent elements (called 
ultra-ion conductors). Such materials are being considered for 
application in lithium cells, third-generation fuel cells, etc. 
Although it might seem surprising, ultra-ion-conductive 
materials are familiar materials in the nuclear field. 
UO[.sup]2[/], a nuclear fuel material, is a typical ultra-ion 
conductor for oxygen ions. Lithium oxide (Li[.sup]2[/]O), the 
strongest candidate for the solid blanket material of fusion 
reactors, is also an ultra-ion conductor for lithium ions, and 
its various properties are closely related to the behavior of 
lithium ions. The following is a description of the 
high-temperature steam electrolytic method using a stabilized 
zirconium solid electrolyte, which is an oxygen ion conductor. 
  This method can be applied to tritium hydrolysis in the fuel 
circulation system for fusion reactors, and to the production of 
hydrogen for the heat use system in high-temperature gas-cooled 
reactors. Figure IV-7 illustrates the basic principle of this 
method. Electrolytic cells consist of an ion conductor 
(electrolyte) and two electrodes on both sides. Water is 
supplied to the cathode in the form of vapor. An electrolytic 
reaction on the cathode side reduces the water, and hydrogen gas 
is separated. Generated oxygen ions are transferred through the 
electrolyte, and become oxygen gas being oxidized on the cathode 
side. Therefore, when vapor is supplied to one side of a ceramic 
barrier to become electrolyzed, vapor and a hydrogen compound 
gas are obtained, and, on the other side, oxygen gas is 
obtained. Research and development for the reverse process of 
this system is also in progress. This has raised some 
interesting nuclear-related topics, exemplifying the changes in 
approach to various research activities. 



  Figure IV-8 illustrates the hydrogen conversion rates for 
vapor as a function of temperature and electrolytic voltage in 
the ideal condition of no internal resistance in the electrolyte 
cells. When responding to tritium hydrolysis in the fuel 
circulation system for fusion reactors, it is necessary to 
operate in a relatively low-temperature range from the 
standpoint of safety. Therefore, it becomes necessary to search 
for solid electrolyte materials with little resistance. When 
zirconia to which ytterbium oxide 
(Yb[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]) has been added is used, 
electrolyte resistance is radically reduced, and electrolyte 
cells can operate sufficiently at around 600C. It has been 
confirmed that almost 100 percent of the tritium vapor is 
decomposed in the real tritium circulation system, such as the 
BEATRIX-II Project, where tritium breeding material in FFTF is 
examined experimentally to determine its breeding properties 
under neutron radiation. 



  As discussed in detail in Part II, research and development 
on lithium oxide (Li[.sup]2[/]O) as tritium breeding material 
for fusion reactors is underway, and it is extremely interesting 
from the standpoint of material science, as is UO[.sup]2[/]. 
UO[.sup]2[/] has a fluor structure. In contrast, 
Li[.sup]2[/]O has a reverse fluor structure, where, as 
opposed to UO[.sup]2[/], oxygen is placed in the position of 
U and Li in the position of oxygen. Therefore, as illustrated in 
Figure IV-9, Li in Li[.sup]2[/]O has an extremely large 
self-diffusion coefficient, as in oxygen in UO[.sup]2[/] (or 
ThO[.sup]2[/] and PuO[.sub]2[/]). Although the fusing 
point of Li[.sup]2[/]O is over 1,600C, its 
self-diffusion coefficient at 1,000C is about 
10[.sup]-6[/]cm[.sup]2[/]s[.sup]-1[/], about half the 
value of ordinary materials in the liquid state. This suggests 
that it is highly probable that a Li atom in the solid state of 
Li[.sup]2[/]O is away from its inherent atomic position, much 
as occurs in the liquid state. This is called sublattice melt, 
and has been verified with laser Raman spectroscopy. Figures 
IV-10 and 11 illustrate Raman spectrum and changes in line width 
by temperature for Li[.sup]2[/]O. The line width of the Raman 
spectrum has a large value at about 100 cm[.sup]-1[/] at 
1,000C, and it is judged that Li atoms are moving actively 
around the inherent atom location. 









  In this way, Li[.sup]2[/]O and UO[.sub]2[/] 
(ThO[.sup]2[/] and PuO[.sub]2[/]) are important materials 
for nuclear systems, and are interesting as materials for the 
analysis of the ultra-ion electrical conduction mechanism from 
the standpoint of material science as well. 
<H5>  (2) Fluoride Glass with Beryllium Fluoride </H5>
  Highly purified SiO[.sup]2[/] glass is used for a 
commercial photoconductive material, but its working wavelength 
range is limited to 0.6-1.8 m. In the meantime, research and 
development using fluoride glass -- which can be used in the 
infrared range and has theoretically superior photoconductive 
properties to SiO[.sup]2[/] glass -- is in progress. 
  There are two types of fluoride glass: BeF[.sup]2[/], 
ZrF[.sup]4[/]-BaF[.sub]2[/] and 
HfF[.sup]4[/]-BaF[.sub]2[/] glass, which have superior 
stability for glass crystallization, and AlF[.sup]3[/] glass, 
which has superior scientific stability and mechanical 
properties. 
  Recently, JAERI succeeded in developing an 
AlF[.sup]3[/]-BeF[.sub]2[/] fluoride glass, which has 
superior scientific stability and mechanical properties, as well 
as superior stability for glass crystallization. This was 
achieved by adding a small amount of BeF[.sup]2[/], which has 
superior glass stability, to AlF[.sup]3[/] glass, which has 
superior scientific stability and mechanical properties. 
Stability of the glass state increases in proportion to the 
difference between crystallization temperature (T[.sup]x[/]) 
and glassification transfer temperature (T[.sup]g[/]). Table 
IV-1 presents values for T[.sup]g[/] and _D_T (= 
T[.sup]x[/]-T[.sub]g[/]) of 
AlF[.sup]3[/]-BeF[.sub]2[/] fluoride glass compared to 
those of a representative fluoride glass. It shows that, 
although ZBLAN is the most common ZrF[.sup]4[/] glass, the 
stability of AlF[.sup]3[/] glass with a little 
BeF[.sup]2[/] is radically improved. As it is obvious from 
Table IV-1, fluoride glass with ThF[.sup]4[/] appears to have 
a high level of performance, which is interesting.

  Assuming the reason for the vast improvement in stability of 
AlF[.sup]3[/] glass with additional BeF[.sub]2[/] lies in 
its structural properties (three-dimensional atom distribution), 
its three-dimensional structural properties have been analyzed 
using molecular dynamics computer simulation. 
  The potential energy between two bodies of BeF[.sup]2[/] 
used in the computation is illustrated in Figure IV-12. In order 
to verify the potential energy precisely, an _a_-quartz 
BeF[.sup]2[/] crystal was reproduced in the computer, and its 
structural parameters were compared with actual measurements. 
The results are presented in Table IV-2. Computed values for 
structural parameters coincided well with the actual values 
obtained by neutron ray diffractometry, and the appropriateness 
of the potential energy used was confirmed. 






  A structural model of AlF[.sup]3[/]-BeF[.sub]2[/] 
(66.7-33.3 mol%) glass at 300 K was obtained using the 
same 
potential energy. The results are illustrated in Figure IV-13. 
In glass, Al[.sup]3+[/] and F[.sup]-[/] constitute 
AlF[.sup]6[/] octahedron according to analysis based on most 
approximate inter-atom distance, coordination number, and angle 
distribution for F-Al-F (&lt; F-Al-F). It has been found that a 
three-dimensional mesh structure is developed between the 
AlF[.sup]6[/] octahedron and BeF[.sub]4[/] tetrahedron, 
created by the addition of BeF[.sup]2[/], with F as the 
common vertex. This is the reason for the production of stable 
glass with additional BeF[.sup]2[/]. 



<H5>  3. Conclusion </H5>
  Actinide compounds and lithium oxide, core materials for 
nuclear systems, are extremely peculiar materials from the 
standpoint of material science. They are also quite interesting 
for the analysis of the superconductivity mechanism for heavy 
fermion, and for the analysis of the ultra-ion conduction 
mechanism. It is one of the research objectives of material 
science to explore such exotic materials, and it is necessary 
for researchers not to shut themselves within conventional 
research concepts, and to change their thought patterns.
