COURT OKS SOME U.S. DRUG TESTS; 
GIVES GOVERNMENT BROAD POWER TO CHECK PUBLIC SAFETY WORKERS 
The Supreme Court, in its first ruling on the constitutionality of drug 
testing, Tuesday gave the government broad power to test employees who are 
entrusted with public safety or sensitive information. 
In two cases, the high court directly upheld federally mandated urine testing 
of railway workers and Customs Service employees, and its opinions appear to 
permit screening of police officers, firefighters, air traffic controllers, bus 
drivers, nuclear plant workers and even some white-collar workers. 
"The government's compelling interests in preventing the promotion of drug 
users to positions where they might endanger the integrity of our nation's 
borders or the life of the citizenry outweigh the privacy interests" of 
individual employees, wrote Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court's newest 
member. 
Bush Administration officials immediately hailed the long-anticipated decisions 
as a landmark in the government's war against drugs. Many drug testing programs 
have been on hold while the legal challenges were pending. 
Called 'Heartening' 
The rulings are "a significant first step in validating what had proved to be a 
useful program" in eradicating drugs in the workplace, Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh said at a press conference. It is a "heartening result for those 
interested in furthering the battle against drug abuse in the United States." 
However, civil liberties advocates and labor union leaders decried what they 
called the most significant court blow to citizens' privacy rights in years. 
"The court has sacrificed the rights and liberties of Customs Service employees 
in our country's nebulous fight against illegal drugs," said Robert Tobias, 
president of a union representing Customs Service workers. 
Ed Chen, staff counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union in Northern 
California, said: "We're disappointed in the decisions. They permit testing 
without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. We feel that a basic Fourth 
Amendment principle has been dispensed with here." 
And, said Peter Arenella, professor of constitutional law at UCLA: "The customs 
case is far more significant than the railway case. Its significance lies in 
the fact that the court is willing to justify, and find reasonable, an invasion 
of privacy rights on the basis of a generalized concern to promote public 
confidence in government employees who are in sensitive drug-interdicting 
positions. 
"Once again," he added, "the Supreme Court has balanced citizens' individual 
rights against society's need for efficient and effective crime control, and 
once again the balance tips in favor of the government." 
The rulings have no direct impact on companies or employees in the private 
sector, because the constitutional provision at issue in the cases -- the 
Fourth Amendment -- only forbids "unreasonable searches and seizures" by 
government officials. 
New Screening Seen 
But federal and union officials said that they expect the court action to spur 
a new surge in drug screening programs in government agencies and industry 
nationwide. A number of police forces, transit agencies and other public 
entities have proposed instituting drug tests for at least some of their 
workers and job applicants. 
While the court opinions clear up doubts about many drug testing programs 
commonly imposed in recent years, they do not answer all the questions. The 
opinions say nothing about random testing of workers. 
In the two cases before the court, the railroad workers were tested only after 
a train accident, while Customs Service employees were tested if they sought 
promotions to jobs that involved seizing drugs or carrying a gun. 
In contrast, the Bush Administration is seeking to require 350,000 federal 
workers in sensitive jobs to submit to random tests. 
Strong Language 
But in its strong language upholding the legal justification for screening, the 
court suggested less concern about the method of screening than about the 
nature of jobs for which it would be used. 
The railway workers operate potentially "lethal" equipment, while the Customs 
Service workers are "our nation's first line of defense" in the war on drugs, 
Kennedy wrote. Such employees "reasonably should expect effective inquiry into 
their fitness and probity," he said. 
Some lawyers said that they expect the high court to clarify which jobs and 
circumstances do not warrant drug testing as it rules on other screening 
programs on a case-by-case basis. 
"We believe the great majority of federal workers will be spared the indignity 
of urine testing according to the court's decision," said Tobias, president of 
the National Treasury Employees Unions, which filed the legal challenge against 
the customs' testing program. 
Cites Car Accidents 
But other union lawyers said that the court appears ready to allow much wider 
testing. "What's to prevent the government from requiring that everyone who is 
involved in an auto accident or is injured on the job be tested for drugs?" 
asked Washington attorney Lawrence Mann, who represented the railway workers. 
"That's about the same situation we had with the railroad workers." 
The high court upheld the testing of railway workers on a 7-2 vote and the 
customs employees by a 5-4 margin. 
The railway decision (Skinner, Transportation Secretary, vs. Railway Labor 
Executives, 87-1555) overturned a 2-1 ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in San Francisco last year that declared that drug and alcohol testing 
of rail workers after accidents was unconstitutional, except when supervisors 
had some "individual suspicion" that an employee was impaired. 
The screening had been imposed by the Federal Railroad Administration in 1985 
in response to a rash of accidents blamed on drunkenness. Two years later, 16 
Amtrak passengers were killed near Baltimore when a Conrail engineer ran his 
locomotive through a stop signal and onto the tracks in front of the speeding 
train. A post-accident test found that the Conrail engineer and his brakeman 
were under the influence of drugs. 
Marshall Dissents 
In a dissent to the high court's majority opinion, Justice Thurgood Marshall, 
joined by William J. Brennan Jr., denounced the use of "dragnet blood and urine 
testing" and said that he feared the "first and worst casualty of the war on 
drugs will be the precious liberties of our citizens. 
"Precisely because the need for action against the drug scourge is manifest, 
the need for vigilance against unconstitutional excess is great," Marshall 
wrote. 
The second case, involving the Customs Service workers, proved more difficult 
for the court because there was no evidence of a drug problem in the agency. 
U.S. Customs Commissioner William von Raab, when he initiated a urine testing 
requirement in May, 1986, said that he believed his employees were "largely 
drug-free." During the first five months of testing, 3,663 employees were 
tested for drugs and only five registered positive, the court was told. 
Bribery, Blackmail 
Nevertheless, the court approved the program. "The almost unique mission of the 
(Customs) service" to curb the smuggling of drugs into the country "gives the 
government a compelling interest in ensuring that many of these employees do 
not use drugs even off-duty, for such use creates risks of bribery and 
blackmail," Kennedy said in the case (NTEU vs. Von Raab, 86-1879). 
Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative appointee of former President Ronald 
Reagan, strongly dissented, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Marshall and 
Brennan. 
He criticized the majority for accepting the government's "feeble 
justifications" for the Customs Service testing program without evidence of 
"even a single instance" of drug abuse in the agency. Von Raab's testing 
program was simply "an exercise in symbolism," Scalia said. By upholding it, 
"the court exposes vast numbers of public employees to this needless 
indignity," he said. 
Staff writers Ronald J. Ostrow in Washington and Henry Weinstein in Los Angeles 
contributed to this story. 
DRUG TESTING IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
 Before Tuesday's Supreme Court decision, approximately 50,000 federal 
employees were subject to random drug tests. That number now is expected to 
increase to 350,000. Tests may be authorized by federal agencies for employees 
in "critical and sensitive" positions, according to a 1986 executive order.
