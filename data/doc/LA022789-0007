THE WORLD 
More than 15,000 people marched in London to protest British plans for four 
possible routes for a high-speed rail link between the capital and the English 
Channel tunnel, now under construction, that will link Britain to France. 
Groups set up by residents of rural southeast England to oppose each of the 
plans handed in letters of protest at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 
office. People who live near the proposed routes maintain that the rail link 
will hurt the environment, be a noisy eyesore and lower property values. The 
tunnel is due to open in 1993, and rail links carrying trains at speeds of up 
to 180 m.p.h. are planned between London and Paris.
