  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 23 KYODO -- Honda Motor Co. is 
considering production of four-wheel [drive] vehicles in Mexico, 
a Honda official said Wednesday [23 February]. 
  The move is apparently designed to capitalize on the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which allows companies to 
make good use of cheaper labor costs in Mexico for production of 
products for export to the United States and Canada. 
  The official said, however, Honda has yet to make a decision 
on when to start production, the scale of production and models 
to be made. 
  Honda now produces motorcycles and automobile parts at a 
plant in Guadalajara, west of Mexico City. 
  The big three U.S. automakers, Volkswagen AG of Germany and 
Japan's Nissan Motor Co. have already established auto 
manufacturing plants in Mexico.
