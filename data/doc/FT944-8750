FT  18 NOV 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Extreme conditions measure up
A range of probes capable of measuring temperature in extreme conditions
such as those inside a nuclear reactor has been developed by Cableries de
Lens, a French company.
The probes consist of thermocouples which are tightly packed with a mineral
insulator such as magnesia or alumina inside a metal sheath. The insulator
protects the thermocouples from chemical attack, while its density and
thermal conductivity allow the same response times as a bare wire of the
same diameter.
