<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Current Federal policy encourages non-Federal development of electrical power resource potential on Federal water
resource projects. The Department of the Interior (Interior), in consultation with the Department of Energy, Western
Area Power Administration (Western), will consider proposals for non-Federal development of hydroelectric power
in the Diamond Fork area of the CUP and the SVP, Utah, consisting of the area from the outlet of the Syar Tunnel to the confluence
of Diamond Fork Creek and the Spanish Fork River. Interior is considering such hydroelectric power development under
a lease of power privilege. No Federal funds will be available for such hydroelectric power development. Western
would have the first opportunity to purchase and/or market the power that would be generated by such development under
a lease of power privilege. The CUP and the SVP are Federal Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) projects. This notice
presents background information, proposal content guidelines, information concerning selection of a non-Federal
entity(s) to develop hydroelectric power in the Diamond Fork area of the CUP and the SVP, and power purchasing and/or
marketing considerations. Interested parties are invited to submit proposals.
