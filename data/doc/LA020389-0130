ANGLO STUDENT COUNT DOWN IN COUNTY, MINORITIES UP 
Anglo enrollment in Orange County schools continued its downward spiral this 
year, according to figures released this week by the county Department of 
Education. At the same time, enrollment of minority students has climbed, 
especially among Latinos and Asians. 
This year, Anglo students are 58.6% of the total enrollment in the county's 28 
school districts, down from 61% the previous year. Their number decreased to 
205,505 from 211,080 in 1987. 
Fifteen years ago, when the Orange County Department of Education first began 
collecting figures on racial and ethnic breakdowns, Anglo students represented 
85.9% of the total enrollment. 
The latest figures reflect the challenge many school districts face to educate 
a broader spectrum of students from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds, 
several educators said, including Dennis Smith, superintendent of the Laguna 
Beach Unified School District. 
Overall in the county, the report shows, the number of Latino students has 
increased 11%, while Asian student enrollment has increased 5% since 1987. 
Even schools with small numbers of minority students are having to spend more 
resources on accommodating a student body with different teaching needs, said 
Smith, whose district has the county's highest percentage of Anglo students at 
92.4%. 
Yet, even in predominantly Anglo Laguna Beach Unified, "we're finding a great 
increase in second-language speakers, particularly in the elementary levels," 
Smith said. "We have many challenges in just getting our staff trained and 
providing good programs to those students." 
The figures, which are broken down by school districts, provide clues as to how 
Orange County is growing, and where ethnic groups tend to be concentrated. 
For example, in the Huntington Beach Union School District, where Anglos make 
up 67% of the student body, total enrollment has continued to decline. In 1988, 
total enrollment dropped 7.6% to 15,199 students. 
In the Santa Ana Unified School District, where only a tenth of the district's 
40,028 students are Anglo, the district has had trouble keeping pace with the 
rapid growth. 
Andrea Capasso, a statistician for the Department of Education, said those 
numbers may reflect some communities' high housing prices, a factor that keeps 
out many young families. Areas such as Santa Ana, where housing is more 
affordable, continue to attract families with young children, she said, 
including many Latino and Asian families. 
Areas that are just developing, such as Mission Viejo to the south, are 
continuing to grow. In those higher income areas, the schools have very few 
minorities. In the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, for example, 
Anglo children make up 83% of the total student enrollment of 23,150. 
The trend in Orange County, which has been apparent for several years, mirrors 
what is happening statewide. In September, the state Deparment of Education 
announced that, for the first time, Anglo students were no longer the majority 
in California schools. Their numbers this school year make up 49.2% of the 
total state enrollment, according to a tally conducted just after the start of 
the new school year. 
The Santa Ana school district's ethnic mix stands out not only among Orange 
County's school districts but also in the state. The district must accommodate 
children who speak 40 different languages. 
Betty Poggi, the director of bilingual education in Santa Ana Unified School 
District, said 51.8% of the students this year are categorized as 
"limited-English speaking." 
That is a far higher percentage than in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, where only 28% of the students are considered "limited English 
speaking," and it is the highest of any of the state's 10 largest school 
districts, Poggi said a recent state report shows. 
"Los Angeles' total enrollment is so much higher than ours, which means that we 
are much more heavily impacted across the board (by students with special 
needs) than they are," Poggi said. 
RACIAL CHANGE IN SCHOOL ENROLLMENT 
Following a statewide trend, Anglo enrollment in Orange County schools 
continues to decline.
