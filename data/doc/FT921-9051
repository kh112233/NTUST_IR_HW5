FT  14 FEB 92 / Inquiry urged on implants
CONGRESSMAN Ted Weiss, chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the US
Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA), is urging a criminal investigation into
whether Dow Corning misled plastic surgeons and the government on the safety
of its devices, writes Karen Zagor from New York.
This week Dow Corning, the biggest maker of silicone breast implants,
published company memos and documents dating back to 1971 which included
some reservations about their safety.
Mr Weiss also attacked the FDA over its decision to revoke the voting powers
of a member of its advisory panel on silicone implants.
Mr Norman Anderson, associate professor of medicine and surgery at Johns
Hopkins University medical, was stripped of his vote after he told Time
magazine the implants should be removed from the market. Mr Anderson is
credited with bringing safety problems with the implants to the FDA's
attention. Mr Weiss warned that the change might undermine the credibility
of the advisory panel.
The FDA said Dr Anderson's voting powers were removed because he appeared to
have already made up his mind about the devices. The advisory panel will
meet next week to consider new information about implants and decide whether
they should remain on the market.
