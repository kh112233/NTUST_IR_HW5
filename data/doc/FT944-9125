FT  17 NOV 94 / Bonn criticised on citizenship
Germany's opposition Social Democrats and groups representing the country's
6.8m foreigners have described the recent compromise agreement by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's coalition government to reform the citizenship law as
'hypocritical' and 'absurd'. The agreement envisages granting dual
nationality to the third generation of children and only until the age of
18, after which time they would have to choose a single nationality.
In a survey published by DPA, the German press agency, representatives from
Hesse state, which is governed by the SPD and the Greens/Bundnis 90, said
they would try to push the Bundesrat, or upper house, into making access to
citizenship easier. The SPD nominally controls 41 of the 68 seats in the
Bundesrat, enough to block legislation from the Bundestag, or lower house.
The criticism by the SPD and the federal agencies responsible for the
interests of foreigners signals the first implicit attack on the Free
Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition.
