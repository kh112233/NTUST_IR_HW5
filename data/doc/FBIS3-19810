  [Excerpt] Hamburg -- There was violence and a traffic jam 
when Kurds blocked several highways in various laenders on 
Tuesday [22 March]. The traffic was blocked, car tires were set 
on fire, and stones thrown at police officers. Several Kurds 
poured gasoline all over themselves and set themselves on fire. 
Several others threatened to burn themselves. Numerous people 
were injured and over 100 persons arrested. 
  In Hesse alone, 120 Kurds were arrested. According to police 
reports, they had come in private cars and a bus. The arrested 
persons have been charged with breach of the peace, dangerous 
bodily injury, duress, and dangerous obstruction of road 
traffic. Interior Minister Kanther wants to comment on the 
riots at a press conference tonight. [passage omitted]
