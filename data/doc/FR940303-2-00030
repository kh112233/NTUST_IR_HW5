Description of Project: 

The proposed project would consist of: (1) A 40.8-acre-foot reservoir; (2) a 120-foot-long and 13-foot-high concrete
gravity dam; (3) a small forebay; (4) two open flumes; (5) two turbine-generator units with an installed capacity
of 240 kilowatts (Kw); (6) a proposed switchyard consisting of two 3-phase transformers, protective relaying, metering
cubicles, and two load disconnect switches. The Switchyard will be paralleled through a 13-kilovolt (kV) connection
to the Cumberland Electric Cooperative Distribution line; and (7) appurtenant facilities. 

When a Declaration of Intention is filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Power Act requires
the Commission to investigate and determine if the interests of interstate or foreign commerce would be affected
by the project. The Commission also determines whether or not the project: (1) would be located on a navigable waterway;
(2) would occupy or affect public lands or reservations of the United States; (3) would utilize surplus water or water
power from a government dam; or (4) if applicable, has involved or would involve any construction subsequent to 1935
that may have increased or would increase the project's head or generating capacity, or have otherwise significantly
modified the project's pre-1935 design or operation. 
l.

 Purpose of Project: 

To operate two 50,000-board-feet lumber drying dehumidification kilns. Power will be purchased from the Cumberland
Electric Cooperative when needed and any excess power produced will be interchanged with the cooperative to offset
power purchases.
