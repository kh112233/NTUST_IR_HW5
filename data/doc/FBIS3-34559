  [Text] Cairo, Feb 8 (AFP) -- The main Moslem militant group 
here on Tuesday called on Egyptians to pull their money out of 
banks within two weeks and claimed a bomb attack on a branch in 
Cairo. 
  The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, which has waged a bloody 
campaign against the secular government of President Husni 
Mubarak, said it planted the bomb which exploded outside a bank 
here Monday night. The bomb went off after the bank closed to 
avoid causing any injuries, said the statement which was sent to 
AFP. 
  The group has urged tourists and foreign investors to quit 
the country, saying it is stepping up its violent campaign 
following the killing of seven of its members by the security 
forces last week. 
  The militants are trying to cripple the Egyptian economy as 
part of their campaign to bring down the Mubarak government and 
install an Iranian-style Islamic republic. 
  The group said Egyptians should withdraw all their cash from 
Egyptian banks within two weeks, and Monday's blast was "part of 
al-Jama'ah's fight against the regime." 
  Almost 300 people have died since the fundamentalists began 
their campaign two years ago, and the money-spinning tourist 
industry has been brought to its knees.
