  [Excerpts] The Investigative Police have arrested the most 
wanted drug trafficker in the country. Selin Valenzuela 
Galdamez, 49, has been at large since 1992, when he was indicted 
by the Swedish courts on charges of having financed many drug 
shipments, including 40 kg of cocaine hidden in packages of 
dried grapes. 
  Two other Chileans were sentenced in Sweden for the same 
crime. The Chilean police reported that Valenzuela has been 
involved in drug trafficking since the 1970's, but that his 
arrest had not been possible because he was using a false name. 
  An Investigative Police officer said that Valenzuela is 
undoubtedly the most wanted drug trafficker in the country 
because of his link with international rings. 
  Valenzuela was arrested in the city of Villa Alemana on 
charges of fraud against many companies for over 70 million 
pesos, and not because of drug trafficking. [passage omitted] 
  The police also arrested two of Valenzuela's partners, 
identified as Ruben Calderon and Raul Oyarsun. The police 
reported that they were using their money to build a luxury inn 
in the Fifth Region.
