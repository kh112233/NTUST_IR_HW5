FT  14 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian tin output slides
Latest official figures indicate that Malaysia's tin production last year
was the lowest since statistics were first compiled.
Malaysia's department of mines says only 9,200 tonnes of tin in concentrates
was produced in the first 10 months of 1993, with probable full year
production put at a little over 10,000 tonnes. In 1992 Malaysia produced
14,300 tonnes.
The drop was blamed on low prices. On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market last year
they averaged MDollars 13.08 a kilogram compared with MDollars 15.23 in
1992. This week trading in has been around the MDollars 12.70 mark.
Malaysia's miners say they need prices around MDollars 16 to cover costs. In
the early 1980s, when they were producing over 60,000 tonnes a year, prices
were MDollars 32 to MDollars 34.
