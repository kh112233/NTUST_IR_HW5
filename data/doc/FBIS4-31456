  [Text] Bratislava June 7 (CTK) -- Slovak Foreign Minister 
Eduard Kukan today confirmed Bratislava's rejection of the 
recommendation by a European Union expert commission that more 
water be diverted into the old course of the River Danube and 
less into the canal that serves the hydroelectric power project 
at Gabcikovo-Nagymaros. 
  The recommendation was intended as a compromise in the 
Slovak-Hungarian dispute over what water regime should be 
adopted until the International Court at The Hague delivers its 
judgement about the disputed hydroelectric project. 
  The Hungarian Parliament agreed with the experts' 
recommendations, but decided to supply the branches of the river 
which are drying up by means of pumps rather than by building 
weirs. 
  Kukan said in a radio interview that the commission's 
recommendation to increase the flow in the old Danube course by 
800 cubic metres a second "is not acceptable to the Slovak 
Government". He said there were other technical measures which 
might permit a different compromise solution with Hungary and 
Bratislava wanted to discuss them. 
  "We have certain positive signs that the Hungarian position 
might be changing, but I would be realistic and wait and see 
what actually happens," Kukan said. He said he assumed talks 
would continue after the new Hungarian Government was formed.
