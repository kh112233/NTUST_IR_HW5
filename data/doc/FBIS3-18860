  [Text] Dollars and 100-crown bills forged in Finland have 
been distributed in Russia via Estonia. Two Finnish men have 
been imprisoned in Estonia on remand for 10 months for 
distributing forged money. They were arrested in southern 
Estonia close to the Russian border in April just under a year 
ago together with two Estonians and a load of forged money. At 
that time the men were carrying 6,500 forged 20-dollar bills as 
well as 48 100-dollar bills. The Finnish police went to Estonia 
to establish that the dollars came from the same series as over 
100 kg of forged dollars previously confiscated in Finland. The 
value of these printed dollars was several million markkas.
