FT  09 JUN 94 / Power-line link to cancer 'possible'
Childhood cancers may be linked to electromagnetic fields and an inquiry is
needed to investigate the possibility, a National Radiological Protection
Board advisory group, chaired by leading cancer specialist Sir Richard Doll,
said yesterday.
Its announcement followed a review of several Scandinavian studies into
claims that exposure to the electromagnetic fields surrounding power cables
might cause cancer.
But the board stressed that the chances of a link were small. Parents who
claim their children have either died from or suffered leukaemia and brain
tumours due to radiation from power cables are taking court action against
electricity suppliers.
