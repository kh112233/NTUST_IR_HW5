FT  23 MAR 93 / Trade unionism in industrialised countries declines
TRADE UNIONISM is in decline across most industrialised economies except
Sweden, according to the annual report of the International Labour Office,
published today
The proportion of workers in unions has dropped sharply in many countries,
with Britain showing the biggest fall to 39 per cent from 55 per cent in
1980.
Membership in the Netherlands fell from 39 per cent to 24 per cent over the
same period. In Germany there was a decline from 36 to 32 per cent and in
Spain from 18 per cent to 11 per cent.
Union membership in France amounts to a mere 10 per cent of the workforce
compared with 18 per cent in 1980, while in the US union membership fell
from 21 per cent to 15 per cent over the past 10 years and in Japan from 30
per cent to 26 per cent.
By contrast in Sweden there was a slight overall rise in membership to 83
per cent of the workforce compared with around 80 per cent in 1980.
The ILO points out that membership levels are not the only way of measuring
union influence.
'Just as important is the extent to which unions are integrated into
national life,' suggests the report.
'In many countries the collective agreements which unions reach are often
extended to cover the whole of the relevant workforce, unionised or not,' it
says. Germany is an example of this.
The ILO also points to the creation of more restrictive laws against unions
by governments and the emergence of employers with union-busting tactics to
explain union decline.
The organisation found Australia the most strike-prone economy in 1991 in
terms of days lost as a result of strikes and lock-outs in manufacturing per
thousand workers. It suffered 891 days not worked.
Spain came second with 537 lost days per thousand workers, followed by New
Zealand with 148.
Britain suffered only 45 lost days per thousand workers, the same as the
Netherlands and among the lowest in the ILO statistics.
On slavery, the ILO estimates up to 33m workers around the world are in
forced labour and up to 30m workers are in what it defines as debt bondage.
This covers workers who are entrapped by employers by being offered a cash
advance which has to be paid off from their future earnings.
The ILO estimates 20m workers in Pakistan (including 7.5m children) are
bonded labourers in industries such as brick-making, quarrying and cigarette
manufacture. In India 15m workers are bonded, of which 10m are children.
The ILO also believes a further 1m workers are in the category of 'modern
forced labour.' These include workers clearing forest in Brazil, sugar cane
workers in Dominica and porters in Burma.
