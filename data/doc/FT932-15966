FT  08 APR 93 / Windfarm proposal submitted to DTI
AN APPLICATION for permission to build Europe's biggest windfarm on the
western edge of the Kielder forest in Northumberland was lodged yesterday
with the Department of Trade and Industry by TriGen Windpower, a joint
venture between UK, US and Japanese companies.
The proposed Pounds 80m windfarm would comprise more than 250 wind turbines,
each 170ft high, with the capacity to feed up to 80 megawatts into the
national grid. Power stations of 50MW or above are the planning
responsibility of the DTI, rather than local authorities.
The three square mile site, believed by TriGen to be the windiest in
England, is 1,500ft above sea level, and is owned by Forest Enterprise, the
Forestry Commission's estate management arm.
TriGen expects average output to be between 20MW and 30MW. The electricity
would go on power lines to a substation at the Royal Air Force's Spadeadam
base in Cumbria.
The project needs planning permission as well as a subsidy under the UK
government's non-fossil fuel obligation scheme, which requires electricity
companies to buy some energy generated from renewable sources.
TriGen Windpower intends to bid for subsidy in the next tranche of schemes,
expected later this year. It hopes to have the windfarm operational by the
end of 1995.
