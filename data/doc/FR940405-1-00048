 

A number of studies have suggested that ETS exposure adversely affects the myocardial oxygen supply-demand relationship;
this would predispose the heart to develop ischemia or exacerbate preexisting ischemia. Direct or indirect exposure
to tobacco smoke has been shown to increase the hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen demand [Exs. 413,
4242] at the same time that it potentially reduces both myocardial oxygen supply and delivery by enhancing
the development of coronary atherosclerosis [Exs. 4242, 4323], causing coronary vasoconstriction
[Exs. 4323, 4324] and reducing the oxygen carrying capacity of blood through increased carboxyhemoglobin
levels [Ex. 413]. As a result, fewer red blood cells are available to transport oxygen to the body, and to the
heart muscle itself. To compensate for this reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, the heart must work harder,
for example, by increasing the heart rate. This is an example of one mechanism by which ETS may place even further stress
on the heart by increasing myocardial oxygen demand, precisely at a time when the oxygen delivery capabilities of
the blood are reduced. 

A second mechanism by which ETS may increase myocardial oxygen demand is via the direct effect of nicotine. The nicotine
in ETS may cause an increased resting heart rate and blood pressure in exposed individuals. 

One study examined the effects of ETS on healthy individuals during exercise, and found that healthy individuals
experienced fatigue at lower work levels when exercising in the presence of ETS [Ex. 4123]. The authors concluded
that ETS exposure interfered with the heart muscle cells' ability to utilize oxygen for energy production. 

Consequently, ETS exposure may have an adverse impact on myocardial metabolism and expose the heart muscle to an increased
susceptibility to injury. These mechanisms of cardiac stress and potential injury to the heart are in agreement with
accepted theories of cardiac injury. 



(d) Acute Heart Effects. 

An acute effect of exposure to ETS is the aggravation of existing heart conditions, such as angina. The National Research
Council (1986) reported, based on the effects of studies by Anderson et al. [Ex. 49] and Aronow et al. [Exs. 414,
416, 417], that angina patients are especially sensitive at carboxyhemoglobin levels between 2 and
4%. Guerin et al. [Ex. 4129] report that physiologically adverse effects occur in humans at 2.5% carboxyhemoglobin
blood content. Cumulative carbon monoxide levels, due to ETS that result in such an effect are not uncommon in work
environments [Ex. 4129]. Acute exposure to ETS has been reported to increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure,
and increase carboxyhemoglobin levels in both angina patients [Exs. 338, 4222] and in healthy subjects
[Exs. 418, 4217]. Acute exposure has also been associated with slight changes in blood components thought
to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, such as endothelial cell count, platelet aggregate ratio,
and platelet sensitivity to prostacyclin [Exs. 440, 480]. Many effects of ETS exposure, such as ischemia,
may be additionally aggravated by simultaneous exposure to other compounds, such as solvents [Exs. 3446,
499]. 



(e) Chronic Heart Effects. 

The occurrence of coronary heart disease in ETS-exposed nonsmokers has been studied by various epidemiological
researchers [Exs. 485, 4120, 4122, 4138, 4139, 4142, 4148, 4154,
4191, 4277, 4295]. Small, but statistically significant (at p &gt; 0.05), increases in coronary
heart disease mortality [Exs. 485, 4138, 4139, 4142, 4277] indicate a modest impact
of long-term ETS tobacco smoke exposure on the cardiovascular health of nonsmokers. The relative risks calculated
in these studies ranged from 1.3 to 2.7. 

The ability of ETS exposure to induce coronary heart disease has also been studied in animals. Zhu et al. [Ex. 4330]
exposed rats to ETS and showed a dose-related increase in myocardial infarct size and a decrease in bleeding time.
But there were no significant differences in serum triglycerides, high density lipoprotein and cholesterol. This
study showed that air nicotine, carbon monoxide, and total particulate concentrations increased with ETS exposure,
and this increased exposure led to a continuous increase in plasma carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, and cotinine levels
in ETS-exposed rats. There was a positive relationship between the infarct size and air nicotine, carbon monoxide,
total particulate concentrations and plasma carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, and cotinine levels. The average concentrations
of air nicotine, carbon monoxide and particulates, according to the authors, were 30-fold, 3-fold and 10- fold higher,
respectively, than in a heavy smoking environment. The duration of exposure, however, was short compared to even
a rat's lifetime. Infarct size nearly doubled following only 180 hours of ETS exposure distributed over a six week
period. 

In the same study, the effect of ETS exposure on platelet function and aortic and pulmonary artery atherosclerosis
in New Zealand male rabbits was demonstrated. The increase of atherosclerosis after exposure to ETS was shown to be
independent of changes in serum lipids and exhibited a dose-response relationship in this study. Average air nicotine,
carbon monoxide and total particulate concentrations were 1,040 &mu;g/m3, 60.2 ppm and 32.8 mg/m3 for high dose group
and 30 &mu;g/m3, 18.8 ppm and 4.0 mg/m3 for low dose group and &lt;1 &mu;g/m3, 3.1 ppm and 0.13 mg/m3 for the control group.
Atherosclerosis in this study was significantly increased in the high dose group. 

Olsen [Ex. 245] exposed rats daily to smoke from University of Kentucky 2R1 Reference cigarettes for 10 minutes, 7
times a week for 4, 8 or 20 weeks. Sidestream (SS) smoke was collected by a moving column of air spiked every minute with
a puff of fresh mainstream (MS) smoke. Rats were exposed to this SS smoke collected in a 2 L/min air flow using a glass
container placed over a burning cigarette. A fraction of this air flow containing SS smoke was diluted with fresh room
air and continuously diverted to the rats as follows: 50%, 25% and 10% SS smoke. Carboxyhemoglobin content for each
treatment group was determined immediately after the last smoke exposure and percent carboxyhemoglobin for each
group was found to be: 4 week exposure-mainstream=7.2

#

1.2 and 25% sidestream=11.8

#

0.7; 8 week exposure mainstream=6.1

#

1.2 and 25% sidestream=11.9

#

0.9; 20 week exposure mainstream=8.3

#

0.9, 10% sidestream=6.30

#

0.5, 25% sidestream=10.8

#

0.8 and 50% sidestream=18.3

#

1.2. This indicates a tobacco smoke-related detrimental effect on blood components, thus increasing the probability
that coronary disease would develop over a longer exposure period.
