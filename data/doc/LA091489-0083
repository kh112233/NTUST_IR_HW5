THE WORLD 
Tibetan courts have sentenced 10 people to prison terms of up to life on 
charges of rioting and spying for the Dalai Lama during an anti-Chinese 
uprising in March, China's official New China News Agency reported. Among those 
sentenced were four former Tibetan monks who received terms ranging from three 
to five years, the news agency said. The rioting in Lhasa, the capital of the 
Himalayan region, was the latest in a series of major outbreaks since violent 
protests against Chinese rule erupted in September, 1987. By official count, 16 
people were killed in the three days of disturbances, although Tibetans say 
that between 20 and 30 died.
