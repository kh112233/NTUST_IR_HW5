FT  24 SEP 92 / Health fees criticised
MEDICAL consultants can earn six times their National Health Service salary
by carrying out equivalent work in the private sector, a study by Laing and
Buisson, health care consultants, said yesterday.
The analysis, sponsored by Norwich Union Healthcare, one of the UK's largest
private health insurers, concluded that private specialists' fees were
substantially above 'necessary' levels and had risen sharply in the past few
years.
It estimates that 12,000 of Britain's 19,000 NHS consultants conduct private
work, and that on average such specialists will earn about Pounds 95,000
this year.
Consultants' net income from private practice as a proportion of total
earnings including that from the NHS has risen from 15 per cent in 1975 to
31 per cent in 1990.
The report says a specialist occupied full-time in private practice charging
at limits set by Bupa, the health insurer, would earn Pounds 300,000-Pounds
340,000.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission announced an inquiry this month into
fees charged by consultants.
