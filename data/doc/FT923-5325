FT  02 SEP 92 / Czech pledge to foreign investors
There is no alternative to a 'civilised divorce' between the Czech lands and
Slovakia, Mr Karel Dyba, the Czech minister for economic policy, told
foreign investors in London yesterday, writes Anthony Robinson.
But he pledged that both sides would work out 'an inventive solution' which
reflected their high degree of economic integration and would guarantee the
free movement of goods, people and capital after their division into
separate states at the end of this year.
Mr Alexander Dubcek, leader of the 1968 reforming Prague Spring in
Czechoslovakia, suffered a broken spine and chest injuries in a car crash
yesterday. 'His condition is critical,' Dr Zdenka Liparova, a physician at a
Prague clinic resuscitation unit, told Reuter.
