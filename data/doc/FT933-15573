FT  08 JUL 93 / Judges call for rethink on Bentley
THREE High Court judges ruled yesterday that Mr Kenneth Clarke 'erred in
law' when the then home secretary refused last October to grant a pardon to
Derek Bentley, who was hanged 40 years ago after being convicted of taking
part in the murder of a policeman.
The judges said it should be possible 'to devise some formula which would
amount to a clear acknowledgement that an injustice was done'.
They added: 'We would invite the home secretary to look at the matter again
and to examine whether it would be just to exercise the prerogative of mercy
in such a way as to give full recognition to the now generally accepted view
that this young man should have been reprieved.'
Bentley had allegedly encouraged a youth to shoot the policeman after the
two were caught attempting a burglary in south London.
Mr Clarke, who as chancellor is in Tokyo at the G7 summit, said: 'As far as
I am aware my judgments in the case have not been challenged. My judgment
was that the verdict of the jury was safe, and that Mr Bentley was in fact
guilty of murder.
'My opinion was he should not have been hanged in the circumstances because
of his mental handicap and because, though more culpable, the other man was
not hanged. I followed the precedent that a royal pardon was only given
where innocence was established.'
