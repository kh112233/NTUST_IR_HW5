<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ilan Mor, spokesman of the Israeli </F>
Embassy in Bonn, by Hans-Joachim Wiese; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Wiese] Good day Mr. Mor. 
  [Mor] Good day, Mr. Wiese. 
  [Wiese] Mr. Mor, the attack on the synagogue in Luebeck has 
caused great outrage. The chairman of the Central Council of 
Jews in Germany, Ignatz Bubis, has called for the search for the 
"mental instigators." How do you assess this attack? 
  [Mor] Of course, we assess it in the same way as Mr. Bubis 
and all other politicians who have commented on the attack so 
far. Israel is observing with close attention what is happening 
in Germany in the sphere of radicalism and anti-Semitism. Like 
everybody else in Germany, we are naturally concerned. 
  [Wiese] Is this attack a confirmation of your fears -- of 
the fear that a new anti-Semitism is emerging in Germany? 
  [Mor] Well, anti-Semitism exists in Germany anyway and, 
unfortunately, everywhere else in the world. Every now and then 
-- not to say regularly -- our fears are confirmed. This is 
naturally a big cause for concern. We are confident that the 
German authorities will do everything possible to prevent such 
events. Unfortunately, such incidents still occur. This is 
very, very bad. 
  [Wiese] Mr. Mor, how do you assess the measures that are 
being taken in Germany against the danger for Jewish 
institutions and the danger for foreigners? Do you think that 
the measures are sufficient? 
  [Mor] Well, I am not in a position to make such an 
assessment. However, the Israeli Government and the Israeli 
citizens in Israel are confident that the German authorities are 
doing everything possible to protect the foreigners and other 
minorities in Germany and to prevent such incidents. Emnid 
published the results of an opinion poll a few days ago. A 
total of 22 percent do not want a Jewish neighbor. This is very 
telling. 
  [Wiese] Mr. Mor, you just talked about possible Israeli 
reactions to events in Germany. Is Israel concerned about 
incidents like the one that just happened in Luebeck? 
  [Mor] Yes, of course. As I just said, for us this is a big 
cause for concern. We are convinced that Weimar is not possible 
in Germany today. However, a total of 40,000 Jews and other 
minorities are living in Germany. There are numerous foreigners 
in Germany who would like to be protected. Of course, we all 
must do everything possible to provide such protection. As I 
just mentioned, Israel is closely following what is happening in 
Germany. Anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism naturally exist 
all over the world. However, against the backdrop of the events 
of 1933 and 1945, such events assume great significance because 
they are occuring in Germany of all countries. 
  [Wiese] Thank you, Mr. Mor. Good bye. 
  [Mor] Good bye.
