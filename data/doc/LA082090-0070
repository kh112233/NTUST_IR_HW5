ABORTION- RIGHTS GROUP PICKETS AGAIN 
About 15 abortion-rights activists picketed outside a large fundamentalist 
church in Van Nuys on Sunday in an effort to dissuade the congregation members 
from supporting Operation Rescue, the militant anti-abortion organization. 
Wearing bright yellow placards that read: "Dialogue is nothing to fear. 
We will listen to you, too," the demonstrators greeted members of the Church on 
the Way as they left Sunday morning services and handed out invitations to a 
meeting Sunday in the Van Nuys Recreation Center. 
Sunday's peaceful demonstration was the second Sunday this month that the 
Irvine-based Coalition Against Christian Violence appeared at the Church on the 
Way at 14300 Sherman Way. 
Coalition leaders Paul Courry and Larkette Lein, Episcopal crusaders for 
abortion rights, said they targeted the 8,000-member church because it supports 
Operation Rescue. 
They allege that Operation Rescue uses tactics that are violent and harassing, 
including biting abortion-rights activists and blocking the entrances to 
clinics where abortions are performed. 
Courry said that after the demonstration he met briefly with Church on the Way 
leaders, who asked him to stop picketing. 
Don Hicks, director of pastoral care for Church on the Way, denied any official 
support for Operation Rescue and said the congregation has been unfairly 
targeted because of its size and prominence. 
He said some parishioners participate in Operation Rescue, but questioned why 
other churches that support the group are not picketed. 
Hicks said the church opposes abortion but does not "mean to raise social 
consciousness by anything other than prayer."
