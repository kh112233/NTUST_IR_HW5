Neurotoxicants produce a wide array of functional deficits, including motor, sensory, and learning or memory dysfunction
(WHO, 1986; Tilson and Mitchell, 1984). Many procedures have been devised to assess overt as well as relatively subtle
changes in those functions; hence their applicability to the detection of neurotoxicity and to hazard characterization.
Many of the behavioral tests have been developed and validated with well-characterized neurotoxicants. Behavioral
tests and agents that affect them have been reviewed recently (WHO, 1986; Cory-Slechta, 1989). Examples of such tests,
the nervous system function being measured, and neurotoxicants known to affect these measures are listed in Table
42.
