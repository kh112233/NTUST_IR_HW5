FT  11 FEB 92 / Breast implant fears recorded in 1971 papers
FURTHER evidence of safety problems with silicone breast implants emerged
yesterday when Dow Corning, the biggest US manufacturer of the device,
released internal documents about the product dating back to 1971, writes
Karen Zagor in New York.
The company later said its board had elected Mr Keith McKennon as new
chairman and chief executive.
Among documents released yesterday was a 1971 memo with details of an
implant that ruptured four months after surgery, causing irritation.
Letters to Dow Corning from a number of doctors outlined recurring problems.
A memo from a sales representative in 1978 said he had experienced 'an
excessive number of ruptures' in his area.
Dow Corning released its documents to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
in an effort to get the agency to revoke its advice to doctors not to use
silicone breast implants until new information on safety was assessed.
The company said most implant problems, discussed in the internal documents,
were associated with earlier prototypes. It added the number of
post-operative ruptures was less than 0.5 per cent.
