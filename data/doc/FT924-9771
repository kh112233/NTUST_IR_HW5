FT  04 NOV 92 / Tamil separatist ambush leaves 32 dead in Sri Lanka
TWENTY-THREE servicemen and nine rebels were killed yesterday when Tamil
separatists ambushed a patrol in eastern Sri Lanka, Reuter reports from
Colombo.
A helicopter gunship, armoured cars and about 500 troops were rushed to
reinforce the patrol, which was surprised by about 100 guerrillas in the
eastern Amparai district, an army spokesman said.
The 40-strong joint air force and police patrol was searching for road mines
when it was surrounded by the rebels. Police said 13 airmen and 10 policemen
were killed.
The bodies of nine rebels from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who are
fighting for a separate state in the island's north and east, were recovered
after a one-hour battle, the officer said.
The ambush was the latest in a series of hit-and-run attacks on similar road
patrols by marauding groups of Tigers.
The Tigers massacred at least 166 people in a raid last month on mainly
Moslem villages in the north-central region.
The Tigers are trying to drive Sinhalese and Moslems out of the island's
eastern areas, which the rebels claim are part of their traditional
homeland. About 25,000 people have been killed since the Tamil rebels
launched their separatist struggle in 1983.
