  [Text] Buenos Aires, 19 Apr (NA) -- Argentine Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella today stated that "efforts will be made" 
to have U.S. engineers clear the Malvinas Islands of mines 
because "their participation would be suitable from a technical 
standpoint so as to have an absolute guarantee." 
  Di Tella, speaking on the radio here in Buenos Aires, denied 
having scheduled an official meeting with the Foreign Office 
[preceding words in English] to discuss a program to clear the 
Malvinas Islands of the 33,000 mines laid during the 1982 war. 
He made it clear that "the issue involving mine clearing has, 
in effect, been a proposal we put forward last year." 
  The Argentine foreign minister stated that he and his 
British 
counterpart had agreed "to make every endeavor" to have this 
task "performed by U.S. engineers, since the objective is to 
have 100 percent success in the area that will be cleared of 
mines."
