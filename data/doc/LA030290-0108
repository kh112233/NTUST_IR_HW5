KELCO WORKERS PROTEST CONTRACT WITH FIRST STRIKE IN DECADE 
The first strike in a decade at Kelco, the nation's largest harvester of kelp, 
got under way Thursday as nearly half of its San Diego-based workers stayed off 
the job, a company spokesman said. 
Steve Zapoticzny, manager of public affairs for Kelco, confirmed that the 187 
members of Local 501 of the International Union of Operating Engineers voted 3 
to 1 Wednesday to reject the company's new contract. 
The old contract expired at midnight. 
"We're all very surprised that it was rejected because we felt we had made 
significant improvements in wage, pension and other benefits," said Zapoticzny, 
who declined to discuss specifics of the offer. "We still don't know what 
triggered the rejection. We're still willing to negotiate." 
On Thursday, as pickets began marching at Kelco headquarters in the harbor area 
under the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge, some machinists refused to cross the 
picket lines formed by the janitors, chemical operators and maintenance 
mechanics that compose the operating engineers' union. Zapoticzny said about 
250 union workers walked out. 
Earlier, the machinists' union had voted to accept a new contract very similar 
to the one the operating engineers rejected. 
Kelco, which has harvested kelp since 1929, employs about 600 workers in San 
Diego. Extracts from the kelp are used in the manufacture of some foods, 
cosmetics, oil and chemicals. 
The last strike against Kelco was in 1980 and lasted for two weeks, Zapoticzny 
said.
