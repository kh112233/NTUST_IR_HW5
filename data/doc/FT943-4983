FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Interest income cuts Scotia loss to Pounds
1.54m
Scotia Holdings, the drugs company which raised Pounds 37m from its
flotation last October, reduced its interim pre-tax loss from Pounds 2.59m
to Pounds 1.54m, helped by net interest income of Pounds 839,000, compared
with interest paid of Pounds 282,000.
However, the previous result was after net exceptional charges of Pounds
1.5m. Profits before R&amp;D, exceptionals and interest eased from Pounds 2.97m
to Pounds 2.92m on sales 14 per cent ahead at Pounds 8.81m (Pounds 7.76m).
Scotia finances research into new drugs with the profits from sales of
evening primrose oil. Research focuses on lipids, important constituents of
the membranes which surround cells.
Mr David Horrobin, chief executive, said the company had five products in
phase 3 trials, yet its cash balances had fallen by only Pounds 467,000 in
the six months. Spending on research and development had risen by more than
40 per cent to Pounds 5.29m.
The pharmaceutical division's sales and royalties fell from Pounds 3.97m to
Pounds 3.85m, reflecting price reductions in the UK, which accounts for 60
per cent of the total. Sales of distribution rights and other operating
income were down 34 per cent at Pounds 1.51m (Pounds 2.3m).
The nutritional division increased sales and royalties by 31 per cent to
Pounds 4.97m (Pounds 3.79m) following a return to the US market and a change
of UK distributor.
Mr Horrobin said the flotation had allowed the group to accelerate patient
recruitment for trials. Drugs in the pipeline include treatments for
diabetic complications, pancreatic cancer and the side effects of
radiotherapy.
Losses per share were 2.5p (6p).
