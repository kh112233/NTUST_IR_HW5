2 ALIEN-SMUGGLER SUSPECTS PICKED UP BY INS AT LAX 
Two suspected smugglers were arrested at Los Angeles International Airport as 
part of a continuing crackdown on the transporting of illegal aliens aboard 
commercial airliners, an Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman said 
Saturday. 
Also arrested late Friday and early Saturday at three domestic airline 
terminals were 35 immigrants, who were about to board 12 separate flights bound 
for New York, Atlanta, Chicago and Dallas. 
Majority From Mexico 
All but eight Salvadorans and four Guatemalans are from Mexico, said John 
Brechtel, assistant district director for investigations. 
Nearly 300 illegal aliens have been arrested nationwide since the crackdown 
began Feb. 27. 
Brechtel said charges of smuggling aliens are expected to be filed Monday 
against Erado Fernandez-Martinez, 26, of Buena Park and Jose Lomeli-Perez, 30, 
of Sonora, Mexico. A third man among those arrested at the airport was 
originally suspected of being a "coyote," or smuggler, but evidence against him 
is "thin," according to the spokesman. 
He said it was not known if Fernandez-Martinez and Lomeli-Perez were working 
together. 
Arraignment Tuesday 
Information obtained so far suggests that these arrests are "unrelated" to the 
arrest last week of Jorge Guzman-Romero, who was also charged with smuggling, 
Brechtel said. 
He said INS officials will seek to have the illegal aliens declared material 
witnesses against the suspected smugglers, who are scheduled to be arraigned 
Tuesday. 
Immigration officials announced Friday that their investigation has expanded to 
include surveillance of several "drop houses," which reportedly are becoming 
increasingly crowded as immigrants wait for the smugglers to arrange alternate 
modes of transportation.
