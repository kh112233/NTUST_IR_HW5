THE QUESTION THAT SOWS DISTRUST; 
RACISM: TRANSPLANTED TEXAN DISCOVERS THAT ALL TOO OFTER SKIN COLOR IS SOLE 
BASIS BY WHICH PEOPLE ARE JUDGED IN SAN DIEGO, AND IT RAISES SOME FUNDAMENTAL 
QUESTIONS ABOUT CITIZENSHIP. 
I often forget my dark complexion. 
This admission is important because it explains my utter surprise and disbelief 
at being approached by a U.S. Border Patrol agent on a recent, early-morning 
Amtrak ride from San Diego to Los Angeles, and asked this question: "Where are 
you from, sir?" 
Quite simply, I was taken aback. So much so that my tongue temporarily wouldn't 
work. Those milliseconds when I was attempting to fashion a response to the 
question seemed like an eternity, and I thought: "Oh no, he notices your 
hesitation. Now he's convinced you're not a U.S. citizen." 
I managed to get the words out: "I'm from San Diego." The accentless English 
was apparently enough to satisfy the agent. 
Thirty seconds later, I could barely contain my anger. If I'd been slightly 
more awake and had my wits about me, I would have answered: "Where are you 
from?" Or better yet: "Soy de San Diego." 
In either language, I was lying. I'm not from San Diego, or Los Angeles -- to 
which I've recently moved. I'm from San Antonio, Tex., and in my 25 years 
there, I never encountered as much blatant racial distrust as I have in 
slightly less than 12 months of living in Southern California. 
First, there was the taunt of an angry driver who thought I was taking too much 
time crossing a street in Mission Hills: "Go back to Tijuana!" 
Then there was the owner of my girlfriend's apartment building, who curtly 
asked why I was waiting outside the complex. His dubious reaction to my 
response told me his suspicion was unallayed. 
Then there was the police officer who ticketed me for making an illegal pass. I 
admit guilt to the hasty driving, but there was something odd here. The officer 
followed me for several blocks from the infraction, but didn't stop me until 
after he had pulled alongside my car at a stop light. 
Believe me, I'm not hyper-sensitive to this sort of thing, but these episodes 
have gotten under my dark -- and usually thick -- skin. In fact, the odd 
circumstances surrounding the ticket didn't even occur to me until after I had 
described the incident to a non-Latino friend, and she suggested the officer's 
possible motivation. 
Finally, there was the incident on the train. The agent was polite and very 
professional. No complaints there. And though he was just doing his job, I 
hardly fit the profile of someone trying to sneak into the country. 
Ironically, I have long harbored a fantasy about a case of mistaken 
citizenship. It's a humorous idea for a short story, or better yet, a stage 
work: A U.S. citizen of Mexican descent is stopped as he attempts to reenter 
the United States. He has lost his wallet and, despite his perfect English, 
can't prove he's an American. He resorts to doing a John Wayne imitation. 
There is a current stage play on the subject: "De Donde?" (shorthand for "Where 
are you from?") -- a production by the Friends and Artists Ensemble in Los 
Angeles. In his Times review of the show, writer Ray Loynd said "For Angelenos, 
the play hits close to home and humanizes whatever imagery, cliches and 
certitudes we have tucked away in the back of our heads about that border 
problem." 
Two phrases stick out there. The first: "For Angelenos, the play hits close to 
home . . . " Actually, it hits close to home for all Southern Californians -- 
including Mexican nationals who are here illegally. While this may not be their 
legal home, it is part of their historical and spiritual home. If not for one 
bad real estate deal -- the 1848 treaty that ended the U.S.-Mexican war -- the 
only "border problem" would be how to keep rich Anglos from invading that 
valuable stretch of Mexico from San Diego to San Francisco. 
The second phrase: " . . . that border problem." You know which problem -- 
hordes of brown-skinned illegals who take those choice jobs in the fields, or 
in sweat shops, or in private residences. Yeah, that border problem. 
The train episode has certainly sensitized me further to the plight of those 
residents -- legal and otherwise -- who more regularly, and more aggressively, 
have their citizenship questioned. 
I've been trying to put the train incident in perspective ever since it 
happened. It seems fundamentally discriminatory to question someone's 
citizenship solely on the basis of one's skin color. And that's all the agent 
had to go by. As opposed to the episode outside my girlfriend's apartment when 
I was casually dressed and groomed on a weekend, on the train I was neatly 
attired, as I was going directly from the train station to my job in downtown 
Los Angeles. 
So I have learned this: In certain parts of San Diego, one should always be 
clean-shaven and well-dressed . . . and preferably white. And having your 
nationality questioned is the price you pay for being dark-skinned in certain 
parts of the United States.
