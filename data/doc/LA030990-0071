3-DEATH SUBWAY CRASH LAID TO LOOSE BOLT 
A loose bolt that failed to support an electric motor led to Wednesday's subway 
derailment that killed three and injured scores of others, a federal 
investigator said Thursday night. 
John Lauber, who heads a team of investigators from the National Transportation 
Safety Board, said the support bolt on a motor under the third car failed, 
causing the motor to swing down and drag along the tracks. 
Lauber said the six-car train derailed when the motor slammed into a switch on 
the tracks near the busy 30th Street Station.
