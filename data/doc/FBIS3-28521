  [Text] Jakarta, Feb. 8 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia condemned on 
Monday the bombing by Serbs of a civilian target, killing 68 
people in Sarajevo on Saturday last week. An official statement 
issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the shelling 
by Serbs of a busy market in Sarajevo was an act against the 
norms which respect human dignity. The attack, which wounded 200 
innocent people, must be condemned as it constituted a brutal 
act, unacceptable to civilised people, the statement said. 
  "This incident should call for the attention of the 
international community that settlement of conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is now on a very pressing stage," the 
statement said. 
  Strong reactions also came from other countries such as the 
Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC), China, Pakistan, 
Bangladesh. Germany, France, the United States, and Turkey, in 
principle, they called on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
(NATO) to launch an air strike for the liberation of Sarajevo 
from the siege of Bosnian Serbs, the daily said. [paragraph as
