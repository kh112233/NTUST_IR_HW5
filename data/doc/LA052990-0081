BUSH RESERVES JUDGMENT ON IOWA BLAST PROBE 
President Bush said Monday he is awaiting a report on the reopened 
investigation into the explosion last year aboard the battleship Iowa, and that 
if Clayton M. Hartwig is shown to be innocent of any blame, the dead seaman 
deserves an apology. 
Bush said he cannot reach any conclusions until he sees all the facts, but he 
said: "Clearly, I'm interested." 
It was his first comment on the matter since investigators reported new 
evidence to Congress on Friday. 
Sandia National Laboratory, hired by Congress to look into the tragedy, 
challenged the Navy's conclusion that the April, 1989, blast that killed 
Hartwig and 46 other sailors was probably an act of suicidal sabotage by 
Hartwig, a gunner's mate. 
The explosion occurred in the reconditioned World War II battleship while gun 
crews were firing the 16-inch guns in the No. 2 turret. 
The Sandia report suggested that the explosion could have been caused by 
gunners "over-ramming" the powder bags into a gun breech. 
Bush, wrapping up a four-day Memorial Day weekend at his summer home here, was 
asked if Hartwig deserved an apology. 
"I have no opinion on it," Bush told reporters before teeing off at the Cape 
Arundel Golf Club. "I really have no judgment." 
But, he said: "If the man is innocent, is proved innocent, of these 
allegations, clearly there should be a statement to that effect." 
The President declined comment when asked to assess the Navy's initial 
investigation, which critics have charged was flawed and even bent on pinning 
blame on Hartwig rather than its own equipment. 
"I can't assess it until I get all the facts. They'll get it (the report) to 
me. . . . I don't know how long."
