FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: US tobacco group lifts
Kazakhstan interest
Philip Morris has agreed to take a majority stake in Alma-Aty Tobacco
Kombinat, a cigarette manufacturer in the former Soviet republic of
Kazakhstan, according to Interfax, the Russian news agency.
The Dollars 310m investment in the operation, in which the US group already
owns a 49 per cent interest, underlines the importance of international
markets to the troubled US food and tobacco group.
Philip Morris would acquire 97 per cent of ATK, while the Kazakh government
would retain 'a golden share', the news agency said.
The investment includes Dollars 48.9m to acquire the equity, a Dollars 50m
bonus to be paid to the Kazakh government, and about Dollars 210m in
spending to improve production, tobacco growing and processing.
In September, Philip Morris agreed to buy a minority interest in the
enterprise and said it would lift its stake to more than 90 per cent within
a year. The deal represented the first in which a foreign company had taken
a significant stake in a privatised enterprise in the former Soviet
republic.
The Kazakh acquisition is the latest in a series of moves in which Philip
Morris has sought to bolster its presence in foreign markets, which account
for a greater percentage of its tobacco revenues than the US. The company
has equity interests in tobacco operations in Russia and Lithuania.
Along with other US tobacco groups, Philip Morris's domestic revenues have
been hit by declining cigarette consumption.
Profits from foreign sales, meanwhile, have grown at a faster pace than
domestic earnings, partly because of the increasing popularity of cut-price
no-frills brands.
The investment in Kazakhstan is intended to flood the region with
American-quality cigarettes. As part of the agreement, ATK will manufacture
Marlboro and other leading Philip Morris brands, as well as local
cigarettes.
