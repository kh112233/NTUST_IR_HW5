WORLD; 
HOSTAGES CHECKED FOR RELEASE 
Doctors examined three British hostages in secret hide-outs as part of final 
preparations for the captives' release, ranking Muslim sources said today. 
The key Shiite sources said that Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, John 
McCarthy and a third British hostage whom they did not identify by name were 
seen Sunday by doctors in secret places where they have been held. 
The sources did not say where the captives were being held, nor did they 
specify the date of the release. 
The pro-Syrian As-Safir newspaper reported today that technical arrangements to 
free British hostages have been completed and the release was a matter of time.
