HELENA BLAST CUTS ELECTRIC POWER TO 37,000 
Runaway railroad cars derailed and exploded early today, knocking out power to 
37,000 people in and around Helena and forcing the evacuation of thousands in 
wind chills of 70 degrees below zero. 
There were no reports of serious injuries in the 4:48 a.m. explosion, which 
rocked houses up to three miles away, overturned cars and shattered windows in 
a nearby college and homes. 
The explosion occurred in an open area near three major power lines, and 
authorities believed that at least one had been severed. Electricity was 
restored to half the city within 10 minutes. 
Firefighters fought a blaze near a railroad tanker containing hydrogen 
peroxide, which threatened to set off a second explosion, Police Capt. Bud 
Carbis said. The fire flared up and spread to a boxcar containing plastic pipe, 
releasing hydrochloride gas, which Carbis described as "very noxious." 
Authorities urged "everybody in town to stay inside," Carbis said. 
About 2,000 people, including 700 to 800 of the 1,100 students at Carroll 
College, were evacuated from a square-mile area around the blast zone, 
officials said. Evacuees went to churches, the Helena Civic Center, the 
National Guard armory and schools, which were already closed because of the 
cold snap. 
The blast initially knocked out power to all of the state capital, which has 
about 27,000 people, and the surrounding Helena Valley, population 10,000.
