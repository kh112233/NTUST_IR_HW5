IRAN'S AYATOLLAH CALLS FIGHT WITH U.S. 'HOLY WAR' 
Iran's spiritual leader today called the struggle against the United States a 
"holy war" and said Muslims who die fighting the U.S. presence in the region 
will go to heaven as martyrs. 
The call by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei came a day after Tehran reportedly agreed to 
give Iraq food and medicine in exchange for oil and cash. 
Such a deal could puncture the U.N. embargo that aims to force Iraq out of 
Kuwait. 
Khamenei's pronouncement also came two days after Iran said it plans to renew 
full diplomatic relations with Iraq, which is seeking to break the isolation 
imposed on it since it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
Speaking on Tehran Radio, Khamenei said: "Muslim nations will not allow America 
to set up its security and defense system in the region. 
"The struggle against American aggression, greed, plans and policies in the 
Persian Gulf will be counted as jihad (holy war), and anybody who is killed on 
that path is a martyr," he said. 
More than 400 Americans and Britons who had been stranded in Kuwait, meanwhile, 
took off today from Baghdad, ending a six-week ordeal. Their Boeing 747 was 
chartered jointly by the United States and Britain.
