  Materials testing usually involves an assessment of the 
particular properties of raw materials or materials (materials 
to constitute industrial products) that are part of products 
according to certain standards. At the same time, standards and 
testing methods are also necessary to assess the results of 
research on materials and mechanics, and to evaluate the 
reliability of products. Therefore, along with the expanding use 
of materials, and the progress of research, there is a growing 
number of material properties to be studied, which in turn leads 
to an increase in the number of measurement methods available, 
and progress in materials testing technology. 
  At JAERI, research and development is aimed at finding 
"practical applications for energy systems, including future 
energy generation systems based on nuclear reaction and the 
production of innovative nuclear fuels." As discussed earlier, 
the materials used for process heat reactors, or the nuclear 
fusion reactors under construction or development, may behave in 
unexpected ways since their operating conditions are an area in 
which we have no experience. Therefore, materials testing at 
JAERI is intended for the "development of a method to detect and 
evaluate unknown behaviors of materials" by introducing the 
results of research in more basic material development, coupled 
with behavior analysis, to meet the needs of such future 
reactors, in addition to the "established methods of materials 
testing." 
  As already noted, the objectives of research at JAERI 
include 
the development of (1) a high-temperature gas reactor, and (2) a 
nuclear fusion reactor. It is also engaged in safety research 
for the light water reactor. One of the major objectives of 
materials testing is to evaluate the reliability of the 
materials used in these reactors. Many of the materials covered 
are either structural materials or materials that require high 
levels of strength. The following are examples of experiments 
conducted to develop tests to measure the strength of various 
materials. 
<H3>  1. Development of Strength Testing Equipment for Irradiated 
Materials </H3>
  We will first introduce the instrumented Charpy testing 
device as an example of equipment designed to improve monitor 
testing, the high-temperature underwater tension testing device 
developed for research on irradiation-assisted stress corrosion 
cracking as an example of equipment designed for both 
engineering evaluation and basic research applications, and a 
post-irradiation materials testing device that uses micro test 
pieces as an example of a key technology development, as well as 
an operating technology development for the accelerator-type 
neutron source. 
<H3>  (1) Improvements in Monitor Testing Technology (Development 
of Instrumented Charpy Testing Device) </H3>
  Steel materials for the pressure vessels of light water 
reactors and high-temperature gas reactors are exposed to 
radiation by high-energy neutrons during operation, and suffer a 
reduction of their tenacity (reduction in rapture resistance). 
With the light water reactor, the tenacity of pressure vessel 
steel is estimated by monitor testing to judge whether or not 
the reduction of tenacity may lead to a nonductile rupture 
(instant brittle rapture). 
  Charpy testing is used for this purpose, and the judgment as 
to whether or not nonductile rupture will occur requires an 
estimate of the rapture tenacity value from the test results. In 
estimating the rapture tenacity value, the change in ductility 
brittleness transient temperature (DBTT) in test pieces is 
obtained from Charpy testing, and then the change of DBTT in the 
pressure vessel is estimated using the designated method. (The 
portion of concern in the pressure vessel is not the inner 
surface of the pressure vessel, but a place somewhat deeper in 
the vessel wall. The neutron dose is smaller, and its energy is 
lower here, considering the location of the monitor test 
pieces.) Next, reference values for the rapture tenacity value 
are obtained and form a calibration curve 
(RT[.sup]NDT[/]-K[.sub]IR[/] curve). 
  In this process, estimates are made for deviations in the 
DBTT change by the difference (in location) of the neutron 
environment between the pressure vessel and the monitor test 
piece, as well as the relationship between the DBTT change and 
the rapture tenacity value. It is believed that such estimates 
provide proper maintenance (on the safety side). A precise 
safety allowance evaluation and improved economy can be expected 
if small rapture tenacity test pieces can be collected directly 
from part of the pressure vessel material (as is being done in 
tests of Russian light water reactor annealing experiment) and 
measured directly to determine their rapture tenacity value. 
  It is well known that test pieces that are larger in size 
and 
faster in distortion speed (as in the case of an impulsive load) 
have a lower rapture tenacity value, since rapture tenacity 
values depend on the mechanical restrictions (size of test 
pieces), and the distortion speed. Rapture tenacity values used 
for rapture prevention evaluation for structures should 
approximate the minimum value. As for the size of test pieces, 
the size of Charpy test pieces is practical for use. Also, it is 
useful to be able to obtain rapture tenacity values from Charpy 
test pieces under the condition of an impulsive load. Although 
the problem of size effects remains in that case, there is a 
possibility of mitigating it by applying elastoplastic rapture 
mechanics. To this end, technological development aimed at 
implementing instrumented Charpy tests has been conducted. 
  The testing of irradiated materials introduced here is 
conducted in a hot cell in the hot laboratory facility. The hot 
cell is a room surrounded by radiation shielding walls. Normally 
it is equipped with an observation window for test operations, 
and a manipulator to replace manual operation. 
  Figure VII (2)-1 is a top view of part of JAERI's JMTR hot 
laboratory (see Figure VII (2)-7 for its cell structure). The 
numbered sections are hot cells, and the equipment listed in 
Table VII (2)-1 is installed in them. Charpy test equipment that 
can be used to monitor testing is installed in the hot cell 3, 
as well as in the hot test room at the Tokai Research 
Establishment. It is used mainly for round robin tests (to 
compare test methods and dose evaluation) for the IAEA, etc. The 
hammer used in these test machines has a structure to which a 
blade with a semiconductor distortion gauge can be installed, in 
addition to an ordinary blade. The position of the blade during 
testing can be measured by reading the rotation angle of the 
hammer electronically. Based on such devices, test loads and 
displacement during impulsive testing can be measured. This is a 
description of the instrumented Charpy test device.

  Figure VII (2)-3 illustrates the relationship between load 
and displacement. The test piece is made of 533B steel, which is 
used for a pressure vessel without irradiation. The test 
temperature is the room temperature. In instrumented Charpy 
tests, the resonance of the blade, the test piece, and the test 
machine appear to overlap with the load-displacement curve, and 
it tends to present a problem in that it is difficult to detect 
the conditions in which cracks occur. However, as long as the 
tenacity of the material remains within this range, resonance is 
not much of a problem. However, there are problems when a test 
piece with precracks induced by fatigue is tested below DBTT to 
obtain its rapture tenacity value. 



  When testing irradiated materials, the handling of materials 
is also a big problem. Charpy testing must be implemented at 
designated temperatures (between -100C and 100C). 
Cooling and heating is done in baths, but a test piece that is 
adjusted for the designated temperature may be affected 
adversely while being transported to the equipment. Therefore, 
placement and testing of the test piece must be conducted 
promptly. The test piece placement device shown in Figure VII 
(2)-4, which is operated remotely, has been added to solve this 
problem. Placement takes about four seconds using this device. 



<H3>  (2) Evaluation Equipment for Irradiation-Assisted Stress 
Corrosion Cracks (High-Temperature Underwater Distortion Speed 
Tension Testing Device) </H3>
  Even in an environment where corrosion is not severe, cracks 
may develop when a tension stress is applied to the material. 
This is largely due to a phenomenon called stress corrosion 
cracking. When the structure and element distribution are 
altered, the material's sensitivity to stress corrosion cracking 
sometimes increases. This is called "irradiation-assisted stress 
corrosion cracking (IASCC)." As already discussed, in an 
environment characterized by massive doses of high-energy 
neutrons, such as the primary wall of the nuclear fusion reactor 
blanket, the temperature rises above 200C. Therefore, even 
with light water for the coolant, and austenitic stainless steel 
for the material, there is a high possibility that IASCC will 
occur and damage soundness if the water quality is not adequate. 
It is assumed that examination for IASCC may become necessary as 
the operational period (life time) of light water reactors is 
extended, even if the environment is not as severe as that in 
nuclear fusion reactors. 
  In order to evaluate sensitivity to IASCC in austenitic 
stainless steel in a high-temperature water environment, 
equipment for slow strain rate technique (SSRT) testing has been 
developed. 
  SSRT testing equipment is designed to conduct tension tests 
at a slow strain rate in a corrosive environment. When tension 
tests are conducted at a proper strain rate (generally below 1 x 
10[.sup]-6[/]/s for 304 steel in high-temperature water), the 
rapture speed and the restoration speed of the protective tissue 
(i.e., oxidation tissue) on the material surface enter a certain 
range, and corrosion begins selectively in the section that has 
a lower corrosion resistance due to the heterogeneity of the 
material. As a result, cracks may develop, showing a low 
ductility. SSRT testing is intended to evaluate the degree of 
sensitivity for stress corrosion cracking based on this 
phenomenon. 
  The newly developed equipment uses high-temperature water to 
create a corrosion environment. This is because priority is 
given to replicating the operational environment for austenitic 
stainless steel in light water reactors, and the projected water 
cooling environment for the nuclear fusion experimental reactor. 
The tension testing section of the equipment consists of a load 
adding device, and an autoclave (with an externally heated 
electric furnace) to provide the high-temperature high-pressure 
environment for test pieces. It is installed in the hot cell. 
The stress corrosion cracking phenomenon is highly sensitive to 
the corrosion potential of the test piece and water quality. 
Therefore, as illustrated in Figure VII (2)-5, electrodes to 
measure the corrosion potential are placed near the test piece 
in the autoclave to monitor the corrosion potential. The water 
loop, which has a water control function, is placed outside the 
hot cell. It supplies high-temperature high-pressure water with 
a controlled oxygen solution. The water loop consists of a water 
quality control section, a high-temperature high-pressure water 
circulation section, and a water quality measurement section. 
Figure VII (2)-6 illustrates the configuration of these systems. 






  This test equipment is installed in the JMTR hot laboratory. 
The specifications of the equipment are presented in Table VII 
(2)-3. The equipment can replicate the PWR environment by 
selecting the highest temperature of 300C. Although the 
operational conditions for the austenitic stainless steel used 
for the primary wall of the nuclear fusion reactor blanket have 
yet to be determined, it does not prevent us from simulating 
this environment as the temperature of the coolant will be about 
100C, and will correspond to PWR conditions. The oxygen 
solution is controlled within a range of 0.01-32 ppm, which 
corresponds to a range where the lower bound is smaller than the 
actual value for the primary coolant for a BWR, to the peak 
value for a saturated oxygen solution.

  Figure VII (2)-7 illustrates the locations of the tension 
test section and the control equipment inside and outside the 
hot cell. Figure VII (2)-8 is a photograph of the interior of 
the cell, including the autoclave, with a view of the hot cell. 
The following considerations have been made in designing and 
producing the SSRT test equipment for irradiated test pieces: 
  (i) Remote-control operability, including manipulator 
operation. 
  (ii) Restriction in size to permit installation in the hot 
cell. 
  (iii) Ability to remove contamination by restricting the 
range of contamination from radioactive materials. 






  For instance, in the tension testing equipment, reliability 
of the load adding device is secured, and the effects of 
external disturbances, such as temperature change, are 
minimized. Furthermore, the autoclave container has a desorption 
device, as illustrated in Figure VII (2)-9, to be operated only 
with the manipulator, and a bi-tongue rubber seal is cooled to 
improve its durability. In such testing, there is a high 
possibility that the high-temperature water loop will be 
contaminated with corrosion products that remain on the surface 
of the test piece, or from the test piece itself. Therefore, it 
is necessary to confine contamination by radioactive materials 
to the area around the autoclave only. To achieve this, filters 
made of sintered metals are used for the exit of the autoclave, 
etc., and it is structured to allow an easy exchange of filters. 
With regard to fixing test pieces, electric insulation is 
necessary to measure the corrosion potential of the test pieces 
during SSRT testing. Also, the operability of the manipulator 
must be considered. Thus zirconium spacers processed with 
surface oxidation are used. 



  The following is an example of the results achieved using 
this equipment. The goal is to determine those operating 
conditions where stress corrosion cracking sensitivity by 
irradiation damage can increase. A test piece of 316 stainless 
steel was irradiated at 300C and 400C with sling 
damage at about 8 dpa at the Oak Ridge Research Reactor (ORR). 
  Figure VII (2)-10 illustrates the load-displacement curves 
obtained in SSRT testing. While the irradiated test piece 
(EL-14) displayed about a 10 percent extension after the tension 
test in a vacuum, the degree of extension in the test piece 
(GFC-15) was reduced (to less than 4 percent of plastic 
extension) in the SSRT test (at a tension speed of 1.8 x 
10[.sup]-4[/] mm/min). The curve for a test piece (EL-31) 
without irradiation is also indicated in the diagram. The 
fractured surface of the irradiated test piece (GFC-15) tested 
in high-temperature water is an intergranular fractured surface, 
as illustrated in Figure VII (2)-11, and this verifies that 
fracture is caused by stress corrosion cracking. 






  Development of equipment for SSRT and EPR testing is not 
sufficient for research on IASCC. In addition, equipment for the 
evaluation of element distribution, such as an analytical 
transmission electron microscope, and equipment to extract test 
pieces from the component materials of operating machines (the 
electric discharge machine for micro test pieces to be 
introduced later) have been developed. Furthermore, development 
of the constant load test machine to measure stress corrosion 
cracking, and the test equipment for stress corrosion cracking 
to be used in reactors has been considered. 
<H3>  (3) Evaluation of Strength of Irradiated Materials Based on 
Micro Test Pieces </H3>
  The size of micro test pieces used for material strength 
evaluation is between 0.1 and several millimeters, which is far 
smaller than the test pieces used for conventional strength 
evaluations. In general, strength properties correspond to the 
size of test pieces. Therefore, it is often not advantageous to 
use test pieces whose size is far smaller than the real parts of 
the structure in question. In reality, of course, smaller test 
pieces are generally used for economic reasons. Therefore, 
standard testing methods are designed (including the size of 
test pieces) to eliminate the problems deriving from the 
reduction of size. 
  The size of the micro test pieces used for material strength 
evaluation is rather small, considering the scale of the parts 
of the structure. In spite of the problems caused by such a gap, 
far smaller test pieces are used for the following reasons: 
  (i) They are essential if an accelerator-type neutron source 
is to be used. 
  (ii) The amount of radiation is restricted, even with 
nuclear 
fission reactor irradiation. 
  (iii) The sizes of parts used in the equipment in question 
have become smaller. 
  Points (i) and (ii) are requirements for nuclear fusion 
reactor materials development. As described in the previous 
chapter, an accelerator-type neutron source is proposed as the 
radiation source for material testing because it can approximate 
the conditions of a neutron environment, and the amount of 
radiation there is extremely small. Furthermore, practically the 
only irradiation equipment that can be used for the development 
of nuclear fusion reactor materials is the high flux isotope 
reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The 
maximum volume that can be irradiated there is only 100 cc, and 
thus the reduction of the size of test pieces is significant. 
  The item (iii) has reference to the fact that minimum 
measurements, such as the thickness of the parts to be used in a 
fusion reactor is only several millimeters, and thus they are 
often small parts rather than large structures, such as pressure 
vessels. Furthermore, as the size of the equipment used in the 
newer light water reactors (such as ABWR and APWR) has become 
smaller, it is necessary to pay attention to new kinds of damage 
that may be different from conventional types. Unlike (i) and 
(ii), this is an extension of the thought that testing is to be 
conducted in conditions that approximate the conditions of the 
real machine materials. In seeking to extend the life time of 
light water reactors, data on the material strength derived from 
parts of the real structure may contribute to improving 
evaluation accuracy. Then, (iii) will respond to such a need. 
Before a piece of equipment, and the materials that compose it, 
can be put to use under severe conditions, it is necessary to 
gather a body of data on a variety of items concerning 
measurements of materials and the causes of damage. Also, there 
may be cases that are difficult to deal with within the range of 
conventional test methods. For instance, it is difficult to 
evaluate the fracture toughness of materials used for thin wall 
equipment when using a test method based on linear fracture 
mechanics. Reducing the size of test pieces will also contribute 
to a reduction of radioactive materials. 
  The use of small test pieces and micro test pieces in 
irradiation tests to evaluate the strength of materials creates 
problems in terms of measurement effects on test pieces, as well 
as the handling of test pieces (which may be too small for the 
manipulator). Measurement effects can be dealt with as follows: 
[1] to discover the range with smaller effects, [2] to formulate 
the measurement effects, and [3] to obtain only relative 
relationships within the same testing. Also, the test method is 
designed to reduce measurement effects. 
  With regard to elastic and plastic properties, materials and 
test piece measurements often fit into case [1]. However, as 
this is difficult to determine logically, for the time being 
judgments must be made on the basis of comparisons with the 
state of distortion in individual cases, and results from tests 
using relatively large pieces. Irradiation often results in a 
stiffening of the materials. This is due to the generation of a 
number of groups of micro defects (on the order of 1 m or 
less) by irradiation. The generation of such groups of micro 
defects tends to reduce measurement effects as far as plastic 
behavior is concerned. In contrast, rapture properties affect 
measurement effects, and these can be realistically treated with 
[2] and [3]. Concerning fatigue behavior, there are some results 
that indicate that certain conditions will reduce measurement 
effects (although the formation effects are larger in some 
cases). Handling technology has been developed by producing 
remote control equipment. 
  The following is a description of the equipment that has 
been 
developed. For testing equipment, we will describe equipment for 
small punch testing and tension testing, as well as test 
equipment to obtain DBTT by trimming. Because handling 
technology for test pieces is important, test piece handling 
equipment and test piece processing equipment will be 
introduced. As test pieces or a test piece material, test pieces 
for the transmission electron microscope (TEM test piece: 
3 x 
0.25 mmt) are used. The reason for this selection is that, in 
spite of the difference with the original purpose, the TEM test 
piece is a small test piece that is irradiated by set standards, 
and offers a number of advantages in obtaining the relationship 
between micro structures and intensity properties. 
  In the meantime, a comprehensive report on technology in the 
nuclear field entitled "Evaluation of Strength of Micro Test 
Piece Materials" has been published by the Atomic Energy Society 
of Japan, and the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM). 
  [1] Strength Test Equipment for Micro Test Piece 
  The strength test equipment for micro test pieces is 
designed 
to conduct small punch (SP) testing, as illustrated in Figure 
VII (2)-12 (together with the test piece holder) and tension 
(small-scale tension) testing for micro test pieces. 



  First, we will describe SP testing. This is a type of 
bulging 
test in which the test piece is deformed while it is in a state 
of two-spindle tension. Therefore, multiple-spindle stress can 
be increased (distortion bind becomes larger) compared to 
tension testing, and a reduction of the measurement effects can 
be expected. Therefore, it is said that property values 
corresponding to the fracture toughness value can be obtained 
from relatively small pieces. This method has been applied at 
the Ames Research Laboratory in the United States, Tohoku 
University, and JAERI. 
  In SP testing, the relationship of deflection between load 
and the test pieces is obtained as illustrated in Figure VII 
(2)-13. This relationship of deflection consists of four 
distortion steps. These are the elastic distortion stage, the 
plastic distortion stage, the plastic film extension stage, and 
the plastic instability stage, in the order of less distortion. 
In the plastic instability stage, the load increase for the 
distortion is reduced, and the load is reduced sharply when 
rapture finally occurs in part of the test piece. Concerning 
material properties, stress at yield of the material can be 
estimated from the conditions of transition from the elastic 
distortion stage to the plastic bending stage, and the fracture 
toughness value can be estimated from the energy spent for 
distortion until rapture occurs (corresponding to the area 
confined by the load-distortion curve or SP energy) or the 
drawing value of the rapture section (to be measured after 
testing). Figure VII (2)-14 illustrates the relationship between 
the SP energy obtained from the same material, and the Jc value 
obtained in the standard fracture toughness test. Because 
materials that present brashiness ductility transition for 
temperature also present transition of SP energy, the brashiness 
ductility transition temperature of the material, usually 
measured by Charpy test, can be estimated from this transition 
temperature (SPDBTT). 






  Except for the size of the test pieces, tension testing for 
micro test pieces is not radically different from ordinary 
tension testing. The shape of these test pieces is illustrated 
in Figure VII (2)-15. However, when the material is hardened by 
irradiation, uniform extension often may not be observed. 
Evaluation of such materials requires drawing values. Drawing 
tends to become smaller when the thickness of the test piece is 
less than its width (when w/t is large) as illustrated in Figure 
VII (2)-16. As change is not significant when the w/t value is 
within 2, the width of the test piece is less than twice the 
thickness. The cross-section of the test piece is smallest near 
the center. This is done to eliminate the effects of stress 
concentrated on the holding section, and to generate rapture 
near the center of the test piece. Measurement effects appear to 
be small in 316 austenite stainless steel, as long as crystal 
grains are not particularly large. The results of tension tests 
using a standard piece and a micro test piece are shown in Table 
VII (2)-4.

  The test piece is attached to the holder illustrated in 
Figure VII (2)-12. The holder in the diagram is one for SP 
testing, and a similar holder is used for holding the test piece 
for tension testing. Attachment of test pieces to the holder is 
implemented by the micro manipulator, which will be introduced 
later. The holder with the test piece is mounted on the 
turntable in the chamber by the ordinary manipulator. Figure VII 
(2)-17 is a view of the test machine (installed in the hot cell) 
and the inside of the chamber. The turntable is a disk with 
holes, on which 12 holders can be mounted. Figure VII (2)-18 is 
a diagram showing a cross-section of the chamber. After mounting 
holders on the turntable, the turntable is rotated to place one 
of the holders directly under the electric furnace (arrow 1 in 
Figure VII (2)-18). Next, the lower rod moves the holder upward 
(arrow 2), and presses to fix the holder to the upper rod. Then, 
the actuator rod is lowered to conduct testing (arrow 3). When 
testing is completed, the lower rod moves down, and returns the 
holder to the turntable (arrow 4). The test is conducted by 
repeating this process. This sequence of actions is controlled 
by a personal computer so that testing can be implemented 
automatically or semiautomatically. 






  The specifications for the testing machine are listed in 
Table VII (2)-5. The measurement of test piece displacement, 
such as deflection of SP test pieces, can affect distortion of 
the testing mechanism by the test load. To reduce such effects, 
the stiffness of the test machine is increased (using the frame, 
which has a capacity for three tons). In addition, the rod for 
displacement measurement with the differential transformer core 
at the end is placed in the lower rod (pipe), and displacement 
is measured by pressing the lower rod to the lower face of the 
test piece (in the case of SP testing). The differential 
transformer is placed outside the chamber to shield it from the 
effects of radiation and temperature.

  [2] High-Speed Punch Test Machine 
  DBTT obtained from TEM test material by SP testing is 
radically lower than DBTT obtained by the standard Charpy test. 
Although it is considered possible to implement conversion based 
on a relative evaluation and the interrelationship of two tests, 
cooling the test material to a low temperature (the temperature 
of liquid nitrogen in the case of nonirradiated 2.25 Cr 1 Mo 
steel) for DBTT measurement may generate a problem in terms of 
testing efficiency. An increase in distortion speed, and a 
concentration of stress increase the DBTT value. High-speed 
punch testing is intended to increase DBTT by applying a 
punching distortion with a high distortion speed to the test 
piece which has a notch for stress concentration. 
  Figure VII (2)-19 is an illustration of the test piece, and 
the punch test method. The test piece has a notch formed into 
concentric circles. Since shear distortion by punching occurs in 
an area of the test piece where stress is concentrated, a 
relatively high distortion speed can be applied in testing 
conducted at the same displacement speed. To obtain a sufficient 
distortion speed, the test piece is punched with a maximum 
displacement speed of 1 m/s. Absorption energy is obtained from 
the relationship between the load and displacement at the time 
of testing. The load is measured by the load cell using a high 
resonant frequency. At present, displacement is obtained from 
the relationship between average speed and time. 



  Figure VII (2)-20 illustrates the relationship between 
absorption energy and temperature obtained by the standard 
Charpy test, the SP test, and the high-speed punch test for test 
materials made of two types of tempered martensitic steel (HT9 
and 8 Cr 2 WTa steel). When DBTT is set in the center of the 
transition temperature range (the method of determining DBTT for 
this test is under examination), then the temperature of this 
test method is higher than that of the SP test. However, there 
was almost no difference in temperature between the two types of 
materials in this test method, although there was a difference 
of about 80C in the standard Charpy test. This probably is 
due to a small difference between the size of the plastic region 
at the tip of cracks, and a small mechanical restriction in the 
growth process of cracks. In other words, it is judged that the 
difference was reduced because of the measurement effects. This 
suggests that it is difficult in general to overcome measurement 
effects when testing test pieces to determine material 
properties related to rapture. Therefore, this test is limited 
to relative evaluations. 



  The mechanism of this device is not much different from that 
of the strength test equipment for micro test pieces shown in 
Figure VII (2)-17. The use of a linearly moving test piece 
holder instead of a rotary one, and a reduction in the size of 
the chamber are the main differences. Otherwise, there are no 
fundamental differences, including clamping of test pieces with 
the upper and the lower rods. The specifications for the test 
equipment are presented in Table VII (2)-6.

  [3] Micro Manipulator and Electric Discharge Machine for 
Micro Test Pieces 
  Practical testing of irradiated materials using micro test 
pieces requires mounting, inspecting, processing, and disposing 
of test pieces by remote control. Based on the "Micro Test Piece 
Materials Testing Technology" project of JAERI, a micro 
manipulator used to mount and inspect test pieces, and an 
electric discharge machine to produce micro pieces for tension 
testing, and small Charpy testing have been developed. 
  In the process of "treating test pieces" in mounting test 
pieces on equipment and jibs, it often becomes necessary to pick 
up a randomly placed test piece, and to transport it to a 
designed location. The micro manipulator illustrated in Figure 
VII (2)-21 was developed as a device to effect supplementary 
control by a personal computer for such operations. The 
following is an example of a process for handling test pieces 
using this equipment. Using an ordinary manipulator, test pieces 
are picked up from the container and placed randomly on the test 
piece plate (in the lower left corner of Figure VII (2)-21) of 
the micro manipulator. Next, the image of the test pieces is 
captured by a video camera located above the test piece plate, 
and numerical data (coordinates) on the locations of individual 
test pieces are obtained. The coordinates are transmitted to the 
XYZ arm, which is equipped with vacuum tweezers. The arm then 
picks up the test piece, and mounts it on the designated jig. 
The equipment includes a rotating stage to reverse test pieces, 
and to obtain transmission X-ray images of test pieces. In 
addition, a nondestructive program to measure the thickness 
distribution of test pieces from the X-ray images made after SP 
testing by the CT method has been developed. 



  Figure VII (2)-22 illustrates the electric discharge machine 
for micro test pieces. The reason for selecting electric 
discharge for processing micro test pieces is that remote 
control can be done easily, and relatively precise processing 
can be implemented on various materials since machining is 
controlled electronically or electrically. The equipment is 
based on XY control of the test piece stage, and on three-axis 
NC control of the processing axis (actuator). The test piece is 
mounted on the processing holder by the micro manipulator, and 
is processed. As the electrode for processing suffers wear 
during processing, it is necessary to prevent such wear without 
sacrificing processing precision to improve operability. One 
measure designed to achieve improvement involves the creation of 
a circuit to generate arc prevention potential in the processing 
power source. 



<H5>  3. Future Development of Materials Testing </H5>
  From the standpoint of developing new types of reactors, the 
major purpose of materials testing is to simulate materials 
performance to evaluate the reliability of plants. Effective 
simulation requires an analysis of the damaging mechanism of 
structures and materials, which in turn depends on basic 
materials research, including designating test items and 
measuring methods. The operational conditions for structural 
materials for new types of reactors, in particular, are affected 
by unprecedented "damage due to compound mechanisms." Such 
mechanisms include high-energy neutrons, high temperature, 
corrosion, stress, and vibration. Therefore, unless the behavior 
of materials is fully assessed by basic research and 
experiments, evaluating the reliability of plants could prove to 
be difficult. Furthermore, as plants are required to have a high 
level of reliability, a basic examination is necessary even for 
items, among compound operations, that are normally free from 
interaction and thus seem less problematic. Therefore, it will 
become necessary to devise ad hoc evaluation tests on various 
items. The following presents some perspectives on the 
development of materials testing in the future, taking as an 
example the development of structural materials for nuclear 
fusion reactors. 
  The materials used to blanket nuclear fusion reactors are 
exposed to intense irradiation (30 dpa at the experimental 
reactor and over 100 dpa at the demonstration reactor) by 
high-energy (14 MeV) neutrons. In addition, they also receive 
chemical effects from light water and liquid metals, which are 
used as coolants, in an environment characterized by high 
temperatures (over 500C for liquid metal cooling, such as a 
PWR condition for light water cooling) and varying stresses. 
Neutron radiation causes irradiation hardening, helium 
brittleness, irradiation-assisted segregation, and void 
swelling. Such changes and other factors -- such as temperature, 
chemical environment, and changes in stress -- work together to 
damage materials in complex ways, such as irradiation corrosion 
cracking. 
  The mechanism behind such complex damage is not simply a 
cumulative operation of various damage mechanisms. For instance, 
hardening by irradiation not only reduces tenacity, but also 
alters the fatigue mechanism, and sometimes helps generate 
fatigue cracking. If such cracking reaches the stage where 
irradiation-assisted segregation causes corrosion resistance to 
deteriorate, the development of cracks can be accelerated by the 
effects of the chemical environment. Also, the introduction of 
plastic deformation by fatigue may alter creep deformation and 
void swelling behavior later on. Therefore, in order to evaluate 
the reliability of materials to be used in a nuclear fusion 
reactor, it is necessary to designate testing methods and items 
by evaluating such compound effects, and by determining whether 
or not compound effects become important. In some cases, actual 
irradiation testing may be necessary. In an effort to deal with 
this problem, the following items for evaluation have been 
examined: 
  [1] Strength Properties in Corrosion Environment (Corrosion 
Fatigue and Stress Corrosion Cracking) 
  Fatigue testing of materials is conducted after neutron 
irradiation in an environment where light water or liquid metals 
are used. In the case of a light water environment, gamma rays 
are applied during testing to adjust the effects of radicals in 
the irradiation environment. As there may be creep effects 
during irradiation (of materials and oxidation tissue), simple 
examination of behavior during irradiation by means of ion 
irradiation may be considered. 
  [2] Creep Fatigue During Irradiation 
  As fatigue load is thought to occur primarily when plasma is 
generated, it is relatively rare for fatigue distortion to occur 
during irradiation. Acceleration of creep by plastic distortion 
is evaluated by alternating creep during irradiation and 
distortion (extracted from the irradiation capsule, and 
irradiated again after applying some plastic distortion as 
post-irradiation testing). 
  [3] Evaluation of Behavior During Abnormal Operation 
  Disruption (decay) of plasma is expected to expose part of 
the primary wall to high temperatures close to the fusing point. 
The effects of change in the texture caused by such a rise in 
temperature on swelling and helium brittleness are evaluated. 
  [4] Texture and Analytical Testing by Transmission Electron 
Microscope 
  Evaluation of damaged texture by the transmission electron 
microscope (TEM), and evaluation of segregation due to 
irradiation damage by micro region element analysis are 
conducted. 
  In addition, of course, other tests such as tension testing, 
fatigue testing, elastic plastic fracture toughness testing, 
fatigue cracking growth testing, irradiation creep testing, and 
permeation density testing (measuring the amount of swelling) 
are conducted. JAERI is engaged in cooperative research on the 
development of nuclear fusion reactor materials with ORNL, where 
some of the above tests are conducted. The facilities for tests 
[1] through [4] will be made available to ORNL. 
  Although [4] above is not included in the conventional range 
of materials testing, it will become important when considering 
the characteristics of material damage in the nuclear fusion 
reactor environment without irradiation equipment at present 
beginning with the stage of texture change in simulated 
irradiation (spectrum adjusted irradiation and ion irradiation). 
It can also be pointed out that irradiation-assisted segregation 
evaluation capability, which is a material behavior control 
factor in the environment for irradiation corrosion, has reached 
a practical level through enhancement of element analysis 
capability (about 2mm of location resolution). For these 
reasons, there is a need to develop specialized equipment. 
  In some cases, irradiated TEM test materials can radiate 
gamma rays at about 200 mSv in air. Therefore, it is essential 
to develop remote control equipment to produce test materials 
(by electrolytic brightening) for the electron microscope. (It 
is necessary to reduce activated sections of the test materials 
to the micro gram order.) 
<H5>  4. Conclusion </H5>
  As mentioned at the beginning, the conditions under which 
materials will be used in new types of reactors are new and 
severe. Therefore, materials may display patterns of behavior 
that are rarely seen in the current environment. The evaluation 
of new items is a required part of materials testing. It is 
supported by evaluation technology (as exemplified by the 
analytical electron microscope and micro test piece material 
evaluation technology), and by the analysis of material behavior 
in complex environments by basic research (as exemplified by 
irradiation-assisted segregation research). Knowledge and 
technology obtained in this way should help expand the range of 
applications in various fields in addition to the nuclear field.
