BRITAIN RECALLS IRAQ ENVOY AFTER REPORTER IS EXECUTED 
Britain recalled its ambassador to Iraq today after the government of President 
Saddam Hussein ignored international appeals and hanged a London-based 
journalist accused of espionage. 
Britain also suspended all ministerial visits and military training programs. 
The decision to recall London's ambassador to Iraq, Harold Walker, came after 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said he was "shocked and repelled" by 
the execution, and he could not remember any other recent case of such 
disregard for united world opinion. 
Farzad Bazoft, 31, was sentenced to death on Saturday by a military court that 
accused him of spying for Israel when he entered an unauthorized military 
complex north of Baghdad last September. He was investigating for the Observer 
newspaper an explosion reported to have killed hundreds of people. 
Officials said a British nurse, Daphne Parish, 52, who was accused of driving 
Bazoft to the restricted zone, had been shifted to a central jail to begin her 
15-year sentence also passed by the revolutionary tribunal. 
Robin Kealy, the British consul general who witnessed the execution inside a 
Baghdad prison, told the BBC that Bazoft looked "hollow-eyed and subdued" as he 
was led to the gallows. 
"He passed on a written message and a number of oral messages to friends and 
colleagues . . . and he repeated that he had been a journalist going after a 
scoop," Kealy said. 
British diplomats said Iraqi Information Minister Latif Nassif Jassim delivered 
the body to the British Embassy and said: "Mrs. Thatcher wanted him alive. We 
are giving you his body. . . . Iraq will not be affected by Britain's anger."
