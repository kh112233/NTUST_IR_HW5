FT  01 SEP 94 / Technology: Coffee and genes
After the non-squashy tomato and the slow-ripening banana, the latest
product to catch the imagination of genetic engineers is the decaffeinated
coffee bean.
This month, ESCAgenetics Corporation, a Californian biotechnology company
based in San Carlos, was granted a patent covering a process for genetically
modifying coffee cells. The company is now looking for a collaborator to
help exploit the process.
That process involves inserting a gene from a wild strain of coffee that
produces low levels of caffeine into coffee cells grown in culture. The same
process could be used to produce coffee plants with better yields and
increased pest resistance.
The developers hope the use of genetic engineering will be a breakthrough in
the hitherto largely frustrating quest to produce naturally decaffeinated
coffee. Attempts to breed decaffeinated coffee plants are complicated
because coffee cells have four sets of chromosomes, making them difficult to
manipulate.
The success of ESCAgenetics's process in producing decaffeinated coffee
plants is so far unproven, and putting the process to the test will be
lengthy. It will take a year from the initial gene-splicing experiment to
produce the first seedlings, after which it will take three to five years to
produce the first crop.
The company believes that decaffeinated coffee produced by its process is
likely to be cheaper than existing methods of decaffeinating coffee. It also
hopes that consumers would prefer its process because of concern about
chemical solvents which are sometimes used to remove caffeine from ordinary
coffee.
If the process proves successful, it could potentially open up a large
market. Decaffeinated coffee accounts for around a third of the coffee
market in health-conscious countries such as the US.
