FT  27 MAY 94 / Bond returns to hospital
Mr Alan Bond, the Australian businessman, was back in hospital yesterday
after a near-collapse during a brief appearance in Perth magistrates' court,
Nikki Tait reports from Sydney.
According to Mr Bond's solicitor, doctors suggested that the former tycoon,
whose empire started to collapse under a pile of debts in the late 1980s and
who filed for personal bankruptcy in 1992, was showing signs of the
beginning of a stroke. His lawyers had applied to suspend a hearing over
four art fraud charges.
