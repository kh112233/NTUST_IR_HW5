Prevention Programs



Under this announcement, funds are available for both local and national projects. A national project must have at
least two sites in different States.

The primary purpose of prevention programs is to find effective means of reaching adolescents, both male and female,
before they become sexually active in order to encourage them to abstain from sexual activity. There is general agreement
that early initiation of sexual activity brings not only the risk of unintended pregnancy but also substantial health
risks to adolescents, primarily infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV. Accordingly,
applicants must provide services that help pre-adolescents and young adolescents acquire knowledge and skills
that will instill healthy attitudes and encourage and support the postponement of early sexual activity. Such services
must also include the provision of medically accurate information relating to reducing the risk of unintended pregnancy
and disease for adolescents who may be or become sexually active.



Under this announcement, OAPP will not fund proposals to develop new prevention curricula.

 Applicants must propose to use existing and available educational materials/curricula which are consistent with
this program announcement.

The OAPP encourages the submission of prevention applications which propose to do the following: (1) Add prevention
services to supplement existing adolescent health education programs or health service programs in school or other
community settings, (2) provide prevention services to minority or other disadvantaged populations, (3) use curricula
which have been demonstrated and evaluated to be effective, (4) include medically accurate information on sexuality,
contraception, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS, (5) offer educational services to parents to
assist them in communicating with their children about sexuality, contraception, STDs and HIV/AIDS, and (6) involve
males and promote male responsibility.

Applicants for prevention programs are not required to provide any specific array of services; a proposal may include
any one or more of the following services as appropriate:

(1) Educational services relating to family life and problems associated with adolescent premarital sexual relations
including:

(a) Information about adoption,

(b) Education on the responsibilities of sexuality and parenting,

(c) The development of material to support the role of parents as the providers of sex education, and

(d) Assistance to parents, schools, youth agencies and health providers to educate adolescents and preadolescents
concerning self-discipline and responsibility in human sexuality;

(2) Appropriate educational and vocational services;

(3) Counseling for the immediate and extended family members of the eligible person;
