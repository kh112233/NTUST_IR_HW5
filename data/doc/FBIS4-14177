  [Text] Cairo, April 27 (AFP) -- The Moslem militant group 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah on Wednesday [27 April] vowed to kill 
President Husni Mubarak to avenge the death of its military 
leader. Police said they gunned down 32-year-old Tal'at Yasin 
Hammam, head of the group's armed wing, and six other militants 
in a dawn raid Monday on his apartment in northeast Cairo. 
  In a statement sent to AFP, al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (the 
Islamic Group) warned Mubarak, saying: "Your head, as well as 
those of hundreds of torturers in the Interior (Ministry), will 
not be enough for our revenge." 
  It mocked the government's effectiveness in fighting 
militants, saying Hammam used to plan his operations from a 
building located "a few meters (yards) from the general 
intelligence offices" in central Cairo. Hammam "dealt one blow 
after the other" to the regime, the statement said. 
  The Egyptian authorities said Hammam was, among other 
things, 
in charge of sending statements to foreign press agencies. 
  Around 380 have been killed in the two years since the 
militants launched their violent campaign to topple Mubarak and 
install an Iranian-style Islamic republic. The dead include 134 
policemen and 135 militants. 
  Experts said the killing of Hammam will be only a temporary 
setback to the fundamentalists.
