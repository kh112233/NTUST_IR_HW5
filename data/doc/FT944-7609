FT  24 NOV 94 / 110 killed in India stampede
At least 110 people were killed in a stampede that followed a police baton
charge on tribal protesters in the western Indian city of Nagpur yesterday,
domestic news agencies reported. They said the problem began when a crowd of
protesters tried to break a police cordon set up to prevent them from
marching on the Maharashtra state assembly.
The agencies quoted police as saying their men pushed back the protesters
with long, iron-tipped bamboo canes and that began a panic-stricken
stampede. They quoted Kripashankar Singh, a senior member of the Congress
party which rules Maharashtra, as saying at least 110 people were killed.
