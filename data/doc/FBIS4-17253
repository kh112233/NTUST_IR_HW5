  [Text] Tallinn, 20 April -- Estonian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs informed ETA, on Wednesday [20 April], of a decree by 
the Russian Government, that postpones enforcement of higher 
tariffs on imports to Russia, enforced first on 15 March and 
causing the Baltic states to accuse Russia of starting an 
"economic war" against them, until 1 July. 
  The Estonian Foreign Ministry said that according to the 
decree, higher tariffs that were paid already, will be paid back 
or accounted for as advance payment. 
  New tariffs were applied by the State Customs Office of the 
Russian Federation on 15 March to all states that do not have 
most favoured nations status agreements with Russia, thus 
causing the Baltic states, that do not have such an agreement, 
to pay twice as high tariffs as the rest of Europe, whereupon 
Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar called the action "economic 
war against Baltics." Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn 
said then that the reason for such an action was Russian 
unstable interior situation and it was aimed at protecting 
domestic markets and reducing profits made by the mediators. 
"They did not aim at putting the Baltics into a difficult 
position but as such an opportunity appeared it was taken 
advantage of," Kahn added then.
