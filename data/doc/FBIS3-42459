  [Text]The "Mosaeroshow-92" Russian International Aerospace 
Exhibition took place on 11-16 August 1992 in the Moscow suburb 
of Zhukovskiy. The Flying-Research Institute (LII) imeni M.M. 
Gromov, Aviaeksport Association, and the German firm Glahe 
International organized it. The exhibition received experts and 
journalists from 11 through 14 August and everyone who wished to 
attend on 15 and 16 August, and an air show was conducted on 16 
August in honor of Air Force Day. 
  The exhibition took place at an airfield belonging to LII, 
the main VPP [runway] of which is 5,500 meters long. There are 
no such large airfields in Europe, and only the airfield at 
Edwards Air Base in the United States can be compared to it. 
Russia spent 85 million rubles [R] to organize the air show, of 
which R60 million was spent on construction of roads and city 
infrastructure and R25 million on development of the exhibition 
complex itself. A portion of the expenditures was covered by the 
cost of entry tickets. With the price of a ticket at R30, the 
amount of proceeds from entry payments totaled more than R8 
million and, considering the lease payments by the exhibitors, 
we can assume that a large portion of the cost of the exhibition 
complex was covered. 
  The "Mosaeroshow-92" organizers managed to develop the 
aerospace exhibition complex in a record short period of time 
(3.5 months). The exhibition complex hardly lags behind the most 
famous aircraft exhibition complex in the world at Le Bourget 
(near Paris). 
  The opportunity that was offered to domestic aerospace 
enterprises to show their items at "Mosaeroshow-92" completely 
meets the assigned task to market domestic products. This 
opportunity is valuable first of all for the producers and 
developers of aircraft equipment, few of whom are capable of 
systematically participating in foreign exhibitions. 
  According to data cited in a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA interview with 
OKB [Experimental Design Bureau] imeni A.I. Mikoyan general 
designer R.A. Belkov, in 1991 not a single aircraft from their 
OKB was sold abroad. A dramatic decline in exports was observed 
in the entire domestic defense industry in 1991. A certain bias 
on the part of a number of potential foreign purchasers 
regarding Russian arms as a result of their unsuccessful 
employment during the course of the Persian Gulf War is among 
the primary causes of this, as well as the lack of 
sophistication of domestic sales structures and possible 
pressure on the Russian Government by the United States. 
Exhibitions of the "Mosaeroshow-92" type will help to disperse 
the bias arising from inadequately thorough analysis of combat 
operations and knowledge of Russian equipment.

  There were 114 aircraft (from super-light aircraft to 
aircraft armed with strategic missiles, a wide-fuselage 
passenger aircraft, and the Buran shuttle craft) exhibited at 
"Mosaeroshow-92", practically exclusively Russian and Ukrainian 
developments, except for several Czech aircraft and Polish 
helicopters. There were no Western aircraft. However, many 
Western firms, while not displaying their products, sent 
representative delegations to assess the prospects of joint 
projects with CIS enterprises. 
  Many items (the Tu-160 and Tu-22M3 strategic bombers, the 
Yak-41M (Yak-141)--the first supersonic vertical take-off and 
landing aircraft in the world--the Il-102 ground attack 
aircraft, the MiG- 29K carrier-based fighter aircraft, the 
Su-27IB fighter-bomber, and the Ka-50 single-seat combat 
helicopter) were demonstrated for the first time. Models of 
air-to-air and air-to-surface aircraft weapons, including the 
latest weapons, and also aircraft equipment were presented and 
were accompanied by such detailed information for the first 
time. Demonstrations of domestic PVO [air defense] and PRO 
[antiballistic missile] missile systems became a sensation. 
  One of the conclusions that may be reached based on the 
results of the exhibition is that there are general purpose 
aircraft in Russia. Recently formed design firms specializing in 
light motorized aircraft displayed their products along with 
veteran OKB's that have expanded their sphere of activity, 
having developed a number of models of general purpose aircraft. 
We can note an excessive turn toward business aviation to the 
detriment of PANKh aviation (for employment in the national 
economy), specifically agricultural aviation, as a "childhood 
disease" of Russian general purpose aviation. 
  During the air show on the exhibition's closing day, 130,000 
spectators saw group and formation aerobatic maneuvers. Quite a 
few exotic acts were demonstrated, like the ejection of a 
manikin in flight at low altitude, low altitude aerial 
refueling, vertical take-off, and extinguishing a fire from an 
Il-76. Unfortunately, this also did not occur without losses. 
During the air show, while ejecting a manikin during take-off at 
low altitude from the rear cockpit of a Su-7UB aircraft this 
aircraft was lost (the pilot successfully ejected). Prior to the 
beginning of the exhibition (on 28 June) during rehearsal of an 
act involving two Yak-38 aircraft carrying a flag, one of them 
was also lost due to engine failure and the pilot was 
automatically ejected when the attitude of the aircraft exceeded 
permissible limits (at the show the flag was transported by a 
Yak-38 aircraft and an Mi-8 helicopter). The cause of the engine 
failure is thought to be hot exhaust gases from another aircraft 
that were reflected from the ground into the air intake. 
  "Mosaeroshow-92" permitted Russian experts to expand 
business 
contacts with foreign partners. A number of contracts were 
signed with foreign and domestic aircraft companies. Managers of 
the OKB imeni A.I. Mikoyan conducted preliminary negotiations 
with the British firm GEC Avionics on the possibility of 
large-scale modernization of the avionics of MiG-21 aircraft, 
which are widely operated in the world despite their age, signed 
an agreement on the creation of an SP [joint venture] with a 
German firm to render assistance in the operation of the 
MiG-29's that are in the German inventory, and conducted 
preliminary negotiations on the sale of MiG-29's to Malaysia, 
and MiG-29's and MiG-31's to Portugal, South Korea, and 
Switzerland. Attempts to convince Germany to purchase an 
additional number of MiG-29 aircraft in an improved variant 
instead of the West European EFA fighter aircraft are 
continuing. The OKB imeni P.O. Sukhoy also conducted 
negotiations with South Korea regarding the possible sale of 
Su-27 fighters, signed a protocol of intentions with Erbas 
Industries on certification of the Su-26 sports-aerobatics 
aircraft in France, and signed a contract with the French firm 
Thomson on cooperation in the sphere of development of onboard 
and navigation equipment for civil aircraft. A preliminary 
agreement was reached on the sale abroad of the S-300PMU, 
S-300V, and Tor ZRK [surface-to-air missile systems]. 
  The signing of an agreement between Russian International 
Airlines-- Aeroflot, the Aviation Complex imeni S.V. Ilyushin, 
and Voronezh Aircraft PO [Production Association] on the 
delivery to Aeroflot, beginning in 1995, of 20 Il-96M aircraft 
equipped with engines from the American firm Pratt &amp; Whitney 
and 
equipment from Rockwell- Collins, took place on the day the air 
show opened (the aircraft's first flight is planned in March 
1993 and they propose deliveries beginning in 1995). At the same 
time, the receipt of an order for three Il-96M aircraft from 
Uzbek National Airlines was announced. The next day the signing 
of an agreement took place between Aeroflot, Rockwell-Collins, 
and the Aviation Complex imeni S.V. Ilyushin for the delivery of 
the TCASII collision warning system on already operating Il-86 
aircraft. And Honeywell, a leading Western firm, formed a new 
Russian firm named Honeywell Aviation Control Moscow to equip 
passenger aircraft with the latest flight-control and navigation 
equipment systems and delivered the first shipment for the new 
Tu-204 airliner. The former socialist countries and China 
displayed interest in the exhibition and the restoration of 
cooperation with these countries is considered possible. 
  Allied Signal, an American concern that sent the most 
impressive delegation (30 experts) among Western firms to 
"Mosaeroshow-92," is already carrying out a number of joint 
programs with Russian partners, and at the exhibition the firm 
Bendix, which is part of the concern, signed an agreement with 
Aircraft Equipment NII [Scientific Research Institute] on joint 
development and production of avionics for existing and future 
Russian aircraft. This is the first major joint project of 
Western and Russian enterprises for aircraft avionics. They 
initially propose to install liquid crystal displays [ZhKI] 
developed by Bendix in Il-96, Il-114, and Tu-204 passenger 
aircraft which are being produced for the Russian domestic 
market--this should be the first application of liquid crystal 
displays on series aircraft. Liquid crystal displays will be 
utilized as flight regime optimization systems on the listed 
aircraft. In the future they plan to develop complete flight- 
control and navigation systems based on liquid crystal displays 
for the Yak-42M, Yak-46, and Be-200 aircraft. 
  Allied Signal's projects that have already been carried out 
jointly with Russia have been associated with other directions 
of the concern's activities: for example, Garrett, the concern's 
subsidiary enterprise, has begun to realize a major joint 
program with Omsk Motor Building Design Bureau [MKB] to develop 
a new VSU [auxiliary power unit] oriented on Russian aircraft 
(which have different required air flows than Western aircraft) 
and that includes Garrett's turbine along with a compressor and 
other auxiliary components of Omsk MKB. Allied Signal's 
large-scale presence is associated with the concern's 
fundamental policy for expansion of cooperation with the CIS as 
a result of the capacity of the CIS aircraft manufacturing 
industry and the outlook for its domestic market. In the opinion 
of Steffenhagen, representative of the concern's Frankfurt 
department responsible for ties with Russia, an enormous and as 
yet unrealized potential is hidden in Russian industry. With 
quite limited technical capabilities, Russian engineers propose 
solutions that frequently are better than Western solutions. 
Furthermore, in his opinion, Russia outstrips the West in 
certain spheres of materials technology. 
  An agreement on the creation of a scientific-research 
technical center in the Moscow suburbs, at which they propose 
employing Russian scientists and engineers, was announced at a 
press conference organized by the Department of Aviation 
Industry, Aviaeksport, and Boeing, the largest American 
aerospace corporation. The joint document was signed on 13 
August by Corporation Senior Vice President B. Cosgrove and 
Department of Aviation Industry General Director A. Bratukhin. 
It is anticipated that the center will already be able to begin 
operating in 1993. Initially, five Boeing engineers and 
approximately 12 Russian scientists will work at the center. In 
the near future they will have to determine the precise location 
of the new institution (possibly on the territory of TsAGI 
[Central Aero-Hydrodynamics Institute]) and compose a list of 
problems. According to Bratukhin's statement, the possible 
spheres of research include "promising directions of practical 
aerodynamics."

<H5>  The Tu-160 Aircraft </H5>
  The Tu-160 multi-mission strategic bomber, accepted into the 
inventory in 1985 and is considered to be the best in the world 
in its class at the present time, was demonstrated for the first 
time on a ramp and in flight. The bomber was manufactured based 
upon an integral design with smooth matching of the wing and 
fuselage. The variable geometry wing ensures flight according to 
various profiles for the aircraft while preserving high 
specifications at both supersonic and also subsonic speed. The 
aircraft has an all-moving vertical and horizontal tail and an 
analog FBW [fly-by-wire control system]. The power plant 
consists of four NK-32 TRDDF [turbojet bypass engines with 
afterburner] engines (4 x 250 kN [kilonewtons]) that are located 
in two pods under the fixed portions of the wing and have 
variable air intakes with a vertical panel. 
  BREO [avionics] includes a strike-navigation system that 
includes an astronavigation system, INS [inertial navigation 
system], PrNK [navigation/attack system], and a radar that is 
designed to detect ground-based and naval surface targets at a 
great distance, an optical-electronic bomb sight, and improved 
active and passive electronic warfare systems. The total number 
of digital processors on board the aircraft exceeds 100. The 
navigator work station consists of eight TsVM [digital 
computers]. 
  The bomber is equipped with a probe and drogue aerial 
refueling system (in the nonoperating position the hose is 
retracted into the nose section of the fuselage in front of the 
pilots' cockpit). The crew consisting of four men is seated in 
K-36DM ejection seats. The crew cockpits are equipped with 
electro-mechanical displays and displays on ELT [cathode ray 
tubes--CRT]. There is a sleeping area for pilot crew rest, a 
toilet, and a galley area to heat food. 
  Various payloads with a total weight of up to 22,500 kg, 
including two drum launchers, each of which can carry six 
strategic cruise missiles with a range of more than 3,000 km, 
drum launchers each armed with 12 RKV-500B short-range guided 
missiles, thermonuclear and conventional bombs (including 
guided), mines, and other weaponry can be located in the two 
weapons bays.

  Structurally, the Tu-160 is close to the American Rockwell 
B-1B strategic bomber and was accepted into the inventory at 
approximately the same time as the American aircraft, in 
comparison with which it has a greater take-off weight and 
combat payload weight and also higher LTKh [flight technical 
specifications]. 
  At the same time, special systems directed at reducing the 
aircraft's radar cross section [RCS] have been more widely 
employed on the B-1B: fixed-geometry S-shaped air intakes and 
radar- absorbing coatings that reduce the RCS (the minimum RCS 
in the course plane is approximately 3 m[.sup]2[/]). At the 
same time, a more pronounced integral configuration than in the 
B-1B bomber, low placement of the cockpit, and an all-moving 
vertical tail, in which the slot between the vertical stabilizer 
and rudder which increases the RCS has been eliminated, promotes 
the reduction of the Tu-160 aircraft's RCS. 
  Unlike the American aircraft, the Tu-160 aircraft is armed 
both with short-range weaponry and with long-range cruise 
missiles (they are only proposing to reequip the B-1B aircraft 
to deliver cruise missiles and also nonnuclear free fall bombs 
and also guided bombs). 
  The assembly of Tu-160 bombers is being carried out at Kazan 
Aircraft Plant. In accordance with the initial plans, they 
proposed to produce a series of 100 Tu-160 aircraft, however, 
reports have recently appeared about a reduction, based upon 
financial considerations, of the number of bombers ordered to 40 
(100 B-1B bombers have been built and they plan to build 20 B-2 
bombers in the United States). 
  In the words of CIS Air Force Commander in Chief P.S. 
Deynekin, under the conditions of economic crisis and 
restrictions on financing aircraft programs caused by it, 
long-range aviation needs a cheaper variant of a strategic 
bomber that has improved operational specifications. 
<H5>  The Burlak Aircraft System </H5>
  One of the possible spheres of employment of the Tu-160 
aircraft is its utilization in the Burlak system, which is 
designed to place light artificial earth satellites into 
near-earth orbit. The system consists of the Tu-160 mother 
aircraft and a solid-fueled cruise missile developed at the 
Raduga MKB [Motor Building Design Bureau].

  Employment of the aircraft system excludes the need to 
develop new or lease existing expensive test ranges or ground 
launch complexes; supports the formation of practically any 
plane of orbit, execution of launches from any acceptable--from 
the point of view of ensuring safety--location of the earth, 
regardless of time of day and climactic or weather conditions; 
reduces average energy expenditures for the launch of an 
equivalent payload by a factor of 2-3 in contrast to a ground 
launch; and also reduces unfavorable impacts on the ecology. The 
missile preparation devices and the system as a whole are 
autonomous, mobile, and ensure an efficient launch of a 
commercial payload. 
<H5>  The Tu-142M3 Heavy Antisubmarine Warfare Aircraft </H5>
  The Tu-142M3 heavy antisubmarine warfare aircraft, which is 
produced at Taganrog and is a modification of the Tu-95 
strategic bomber, the first flight of which occurred in 1952 and 
adoption into the Air Force inventory in 1956, was demonstrated 
on the ramp. 
  Besides the Tu-142, the Tu-114 passenger aircraft, the 
Tu-126 
DRLO [AWACS] aircraft, a reconnaissance-target designation 
aircraft designed for coordination with surface combatants and 
submarines that are equipped with long-range antiship cruise 
missiles, an airborne command post aircraft, and also various 
flying laboratories for developing engines, weaponry, and 
onboard equipment were developed based on the Tu-95. 
  The Tu-142M3 aircraft is capable of conducting combat with 
submarines of all types (including modern nuclear submarines) at 
a range of up to 5,000 km from the basing airfield, and is 
equipped with various equipment including a magnetometer, a 
powerful radar that has 360 surveillance in the lower 
hemisphere, and a large number of droppable acoustic buoys. 
There is an onboard ASU [automated command and control system] 
to process information on targets. 
  The Tu-142M3 aircraft's weaponry includes antiship guided 
missiles, torpedoes, and depth charges, and also eight Kh-35 
antiship missiles on two underwing pylons. The aircraft is 
equipped with an aerial refueling probe and flight duration can 
reach 17 hours. A variant has been developed to equip the bomber 
with equipment that permits the aircraft to be used to airlift 
cargoes weighing up to 20 tonnes. 
  Tu-142 aircraft of various modifications are being used in 
Russia's naval aviation and are being built at the Taganrog 
Aircraft Plant. Eight Tu-142M aircraft have been delivered to 
the Indian Navy. 
<H5>  The Tu-95MS Bomber </H5>
  The Tu-95MS Bomber, which was demonstrated in flight, can be 
armed with six 2,500 km range RKV-15B cruise missiles located on 
an internal drum launcher and also with nuclear and conventional 
free fall bombs. The weight of the payload in the bomb bay is 
12,000 kg. Defensive weaponry of the Tu-142 and Tu-95MS aircraft 
includes two GSh-23 cannons that are installed in the tail of 
the aircraft (the cannon has been standardized with the cannon 
used on the Il-76 and Il-78 aircraft). Four NK-12MV TVD 
[turboprop engines] (4 x 15,000 horsepower) are utilized as a 
power plant. Tu-95MS aircraft are built at an aircraft plant at 
Samara.

<H5>  The Tu-22M3 Bomber </H5>
  At "Mosaeroshow-92" the ANTK [Aircraft Scientific Technical 
Combine] imeni A.N. Tupolev, TsAGI, and LII displayed an 
aircraft-laboratory based on the Tu-22M3 bomber (known in the 
West as Backfire), which is designed for flight research of 
natural laminarization of sweptwing flow of next generation 
passenger aircraft. The goal of the tests is: 
  --to determine the mechanism of the shift of the boundary 
layer on sweptwings under full-scale Reynolds numbers; 
  --to more precisely define theoretical developments and 
improve calculation methods; 
  --to determine the requirements for manufacturing technology 
and the quality of the surface of laminarized wings; and, 
  --to determine the requirements for operating 
characteristics 
of laminarized wings under various climactic conditions. 
  Measurements must be conducted in the Mach range from 0.6 to 
0.82; Reynolds numbers (14-30) x 10[.sup]0[/]; angles of wing 
sweep along the leading edge from 17 to 30; and flight 
altitudes from five to 10 km. Sections on both outer wing panels 
have been modified for research. They propose beginning the 
tests immediately after completion of the exhibition. Pressure 
distribution, the location of the shift point from the laminar 
boundary layer to turbulence layer, and surface friction will be 
determined in flight. 
  The Tu-22M3 bomber has been in the Russian Air Force and 
Navy 
inventory since 1981 and is in series production at the Kazan 
Aircraft Plant (in accordance with the protocol to the SALT II 
Treaty between the USSR and United States the rate of production 
has been restricted to 30 aircraft per year). The Tu-22M3 
aircraft and preceding modifications of the Tu-22M and Tu-22M2 
are the further development of the Tu-22 bomber and the first 
long-range bomber with a variable geometry wing.

  The aircraft is equipped with NK-25 turbojet bypass engines 
with afterburner (2 x 250 kN, an NK-22 engine with maximum 
afterburner thrust of 2 x 220 kN has been installed on the 
Tu-22M2), a long- range radar that ensures detection of 
ground-based and naval surface targets, an optical-electronic 
bomb sight, and an INS. The crew of four men is seated in KT-1 
ejection seats. The aircraft has active and passive electronic 
warfare systems. 
  Kh-22 guided missiles, designed to destroy naval surface or 
stationary ground-based targets, are located under the fuselage 
in a semirecessed position. Another two missiles of the same 
type are located on underwing pylons. Six RKV-500B short-range 
guided missiles or their antiship modifications can be placed on 
a drum launcher in the weapons bay. Bomb weapons with a total 
weight of up to 24,000 kg are suspended in the weapons bay on 
two ventral and two underwing multiclamp bomb holders and can 
include up to 69 bombs of 250 kg or eight 1,500 kg bombs. 
  Defensive weaponry consists of one modernized GSh-23 cannon 
(23 mm, 4,000 rounds per minute, two GSh-23 cannons with a rate 
of fire of 3,400 rounds per minute have been installed on the 
Tu-22M2) with a remote control system that has television and 
radar channels. 
<H5>  Aircraft of the OKB imeni P.O. Sukhoy </H5>
<H5>  Variants of the Su-27 Fighter Aircraft </H5>
  The Su-27K and Su-27UB aircraft, variants of the well-known 
Su-27 single-seat twin-engine fighter-interceptor, were 
exhibited on the ramp of the OKB imeni P.O. Sukhoy. The basic 
Su-27 aircraft and the Su-27IB, one of its latest modifications, 
were demonstrated in flight. 
  The Su-27's modern aerodynamic configuration, powerful and 
efficient bypass turbojet engines, large fuel reserve, broad 
range of altitudes and flight speeds, highly effective avionics 
system, and modern guided missile weaponry ensures its high 
effectiveness while intercepting airborne targets. Since the 
very beginning, the Su-27 was developed as the first domestic, 
statically unstable fighter aircraft with a fly-by-wire control 
system (FBW) that provides the aircraft's artificial stability 
for pitch, bank, and yaw. The fly- by-wire control channels are 
located throughout the entire extent of the aircraft. 
  A high thrust-to-weight ratio, the availability of the 
fly-by-wire control system with automatic restriction of the 
aircraft's permissible angle of attack and the maximum G-load 
while flying, the adaptive wing, the weapons control system with 
the use of an optical-electronic radar and helmet-mounted target 
designation system, and also powerful weaponry permit the Su-27 
interceptor to confidently conduct close, maneuvering air combat. 
  The AL-31F turbojet bypass engine with afterburner, 
developed 
at the OKB imeni A. M. Lyulka and installed on the Su-27, is the 
first world-level bypass engine in our country. The AL-31F 
operates in a wide range of altitudes and flight speeds and 
smoothly operates in regimes of a deep surge of the air intake 
at Mach 2 under conditions of a flat, normal, or inverted spin. 
The surge elimination systems, automatic engine start in flight, 
and auto continuous ignition of the primary chamber and 
afterburner ensure the reliability of the power plant while 
employing onboard weaponry. 
  An effective electronic combat system is utilized on the 
aircraft which consists of the Sorbitsiya-S active jammer (its 
foreign equivalent is the AN/ALQ-135). Armament consists of a 
built-in GSh- 30-1 cannon (30 mm, 1,500 rounds per minute, 150 
rounds), up to 10 air-to-air missiles, including the R-27 
medium-range guided missile and the R-73 close-range guided 
missile. 
  In 1986-1988, 27 time-to-climb and horizontal flight 
altitude 
world records were set in the interceptor variant of the Su-27 
that has the designation P-42 (with R-32 turbojet bypass engines 
with afterburner, 2 x 133.37 kN, 2 x 136 kN). 
  The year 1969 marks the beginning of the development of the 
aircraft and the first flight of the T-10-1 prototype aircraft 
occurred on 20 May 1977. The Su-27 has been in the Russian Air 
Force inventory since 1984. In 1991, as a result of budget 
restrictions, the Air Force decided to develop a base Su-27 and 
develop a reconnaissance aircraft, a fighter-bomber, a jammer, 
an all-weather interceptor, etc. based upon it, to concentrate 
resources on combat aircraft, and to prevent the development of 
various types of aircraft with identical missions, and ceased 
purchases of MiG-29 aircraft. 
  In August 1992 the first Su-27 aircraft of a shipment of 24 
aircraft were transferred to China within the framework of a 
$1.5 billion contract at a price of $35 million per equipped 
aircraft. This is the first delivery of Russian weaponry to 
China in the last 30 years. Russian military instructor-pilots 
were to have provided retraining of 200 Chinese pilots for this 
type of aircraft, however, the Chinese refused the services of 
the Russian Air Force, explaining that they have their own 
instructors who underwent flight training in the Su-27 at a CIS 
aviation school. The Su-27 has been series produced at 
Komsomolsk-na-Amur since 1982 and the Su-27UB at Irkutsk since 
1986. 
  A coherent pulse-Doppler jam-proof radar, which has the 
capability to search and track targets in the background of the 
underlying surface, has been installed on the Su-27 (it provides 
track-while- scan and the simultaneous launch of guided missiles 
against two targets). A 36Sh optical radar system, developed at 
the Geofizika NPO [Scientific Production Association] and slaved 
to the helmet- mounted target designation system, supplements 
the radar and was demonstrated at the exhibition. The system is 
designed to determine the coordinates of contrasting thermal 
mobile targets and has the following technical specifications:

  The Su-27UB is a combat trainer fighter aircraft designed to 
retrain pilots into the Su-27 aircraft; it retains all the 
combat capabilities of the SU-27 (the weapons and weapons 
control systems have been completely preserved), and provides an 
outstanding field of view to the pilots from both cockpits. The 
seats are located in tandem in the two-seat cockpit. Series 
production has begun of an Su-27UB modification that is equipped 
with an aerial refueling system. In 1988 a Su-27UB completed a 
flight from Moscow-- Komsomolsk-na-Amur--Moscow, a distance of 
13,440 km, with four aerial refuelings and without landing. 
  The Su-27IB is a two-seat fighter-bomber with the seats 
located side by side. It is designed to destroy heavily defended 
point targets in any weather conditions, during the day or at 
night. It is capable of completing a flight in the terrain 
following mode. The Su-27IB is designed to replace the first 
variants of the Su-24 aircraft. It is similar to the American 
McDonnell-Douglas F-15E fighter-bomber. The Su-27IB took off for 
the first time on 13 April 1990 (test pilot A. Ivanov). It was 
publicly demonstrated for the first time at Machulishchi 
Airfield (near Minsk) during a meeting of the CIS member-states 
heads of state on 13 February 1992. At least two more years will 
be required to complete aircraft flight tests. The Su-27IB has 
an integral aerodynamic configuration and is manufactured 
according to a "triplane" with PGO [foreplanes] design. It is 
also distinguished by the utilization of a twin-wheel nose gear 
and reinforced main landing gear, and it does not have ventral 
fins. The cockpit is an armored capsule with the employment of a 
titanium alloy and armored glass, entry into the cockpit is 
through a folding ladder in the forward landing gear well. The 
cockpit is equipped with multifunction cathode ray tube displays 
and the seats are distinguished by their improved ergonomics. 
Approximately 30% of the weapons control system has been 
modified to support aircraft operations against ground-based 
targets. 
  The aircraft can be armed with two Kh-31 antiradiation 
missiles on suspension points under the engine air intakes, 500 
kg laser-guided bombs on internal underwing pylons, Kh-29T 
television-guided and Kh- 29L laser-guided air-to-surface guided 
missiles on the middle underwing pylons, with RVV-AE medium 
range air-to-air missiles on the external underwing pylons, and 
with R-73 infrared seeker dogfight missiles on the ends of the 
wing. KAB-150 and UAB-500 bombs can be installed (the bombs have 
laser, television, or infrared guidance). Guidance of the Kh-29 
guided missiles can be carried out using the helmet-mounted 
system. The 30 mm cannon has been retained in the starboard wing 
root extension and a retractable aerial refueling probe has been 
located in the port wing root extension. The aircraft's nose 
fairing has a flattened shape with developed side extensions and 
tapered edges. The nose fairing was manufactured from metal and 
was not equipped with instruments in the test model of the 
aircraft that was demonstrated. In the future, they propose 
installing a radar with a small antenna in it. 
  The Su-27K is a carrier-based fighter aircraft for defense 
of 
Navy ships from enemy offensive air weaponry. Work on the 
development of the carrier-based variant of the Su-27 aircraft 
began in 1977, the first flights of the Su-27 aircraft from a 
ground-based ski jump took place in the summer of 1982, and the 
first landing of a Su-27 on an arresting gear occurred on 1 
September 1985. The first flight of the Su-27K (T-10-1) test 
model occurred on 17 August 1987 (V.G. Pugachev). On 1 November 
1989, the Su-27K carried out a landing in aircraft fashion on 
the deck of the Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union 
Kuznetsov heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser for the first time in 
the USSR and took off from the ship's deck using a ski jump. 
They proposed demonstrating the Su-27K for the first time in the 
West at the 1992 Berlin Aerospace Exhibition. The pre-series- 
production model was demonstrated at "Mosaeroshow-92." 
Completion of state testing was noted in July 1992 and the 
decision was made on series production. According to unofficial 
data, a contract has been concluded on the export sale of the 
Su-27K. 
  The Su-27K is manufactured based upon the "triplane" with 
PGO 
design that significantly expands the aircraft's maneuvering 
capabilities. The fighter is equipped with a folding wing and 
stabilizer. Automatically deflected wing leading edge 
mechanization permits it to carry out flights through an 
envelope of the drag polars, and the developed mechanization of 
the trailing edge increases lift by a factor of 1.5 during 
landing and substantially reduces landing speed. The cockpit 
seat has an increased angle of incline. The flight-navigation 
system provides automatic flight until touchdown on the ship's 
deck. The retractable aerial refueling probe is located ahead of 
the cockpit on the left side. The optical- electronic radar is 
located on the right if you are looking out from the cockpit (on 
the initial Su-27 it has a central location). The aircraft has a 
multichannel communications system and a developed electronic 
countermeasures system. 
  Besides the built-in 30 mm cannon, the Su-27K's weaponry 
includes the Moskvit long-range supersonic antiship guided 
missile (located on a ventral suspension point on a special 
tray) and up to 10 air- to-air missiles. The LII demonstrated a 
flying laboratory on the ramp that was developed based on the 
Su-27 aircraft to study active flight safety support systems of 
future maneuvering aircraft and optimal control of their 
trajectory movement. The flying laboratory is being utilized as 
part of the LMK-2405 flight-modeling system that also includes a 
ground test-adjustment stand. The flying laboratory is equipped 
with a complex control system that combines an experimental 
aircraft and engine control system and an experimental 
information and control element depiction system. 
Omnidirectional information exchange system is utilized for 
communications with a ground station. The flight test control 
system supports processing of external trajectory changes, 
radio- telemetry information, and also modeling and formation of 
the laws of control utilizing a ground stand. 
  Six Su-27 aircraft are part of the "Russian Warriors" 
acrobatic team that performs with success in Russia and abroad. 
Test pilot A. Kvochur, who performed at "Mosaeroshow-92" with 
demonstration flights in the Su-27, recently organized a new 
acrobatic team which is equipped with four Su-27 aircraft (two 
single-seat and two twin- seat aircraft with an aerial refueling 
system) that were painted using Western-manufactured paint. The 
aircraft were purchased at the plant (single-seat aircraft at 
Komsomolsk-na-Amur) at a price of R50 million per aircraft. The 
private insurance company Yupiter provided the funds for the 
acquisition of the aircraft. 
<H5>  The Su-24MR Reconnaissance Aircraft </H5>
  The Su-24MR specialized reconnaissance aircraft that was 
demonstrated for the first time was exhibited in Russian 
tricolors at the ramp of OKB imeni P.O. Sukhoy. This aircraft 
was developed based on the Su-24M frontal aviation bomber, has a 
variable swept wing, and is designed to provide reconnaissance 
information to ground troops and frontal aviation commanders 
and, on maritime axes, to the Navy. It can carry out 
comprehensive all-weather aerial reconnaissance during the day 
and at night in a wide range of altitudes and speeds to a depth 
of 400 km beyond the line of contact under the impact of enemy 
PVO [air defense] weapons systems. To carry out reconnaissance 
missions, the aircraft is equipped with the BKR-1 reconnaissance 
system which ensures a high probability of detection and 
identification of military equipment targets, including decoys 
and camouflaged targets. The Su-24MR aircraft can be employed 
for civilian purposes to assess radiation contamination of 
terrain and air near AES's [nuclear power plants], detection of 
spills of petroleum products on the ground and in the water, 
monitoring the state of forest areas and detection of forest 
fires, terrain mapping, etc. 
  Cameras for panoramic and oblique photography, a radar 
system, infrared and television reconnaissance have been 
installed onboard the aircraft and laser, radio-technical, and 
radiation reconnaissance equipment are located in removable 
external pods. The reconnaissance systems are controlled 
automatically and manually. The onboard navigation equipment 
supports the flight of the aircraft along a preprogrammed route, 
aircraft entry into the reconnaissance sector, and low-altitude 
flight with collision warning and fly around of obstacles. 
  The Shtyk side-looking radar, developed at Vega-M MNIIP NPO, 
has been installed in the aircraft nose section and the 
Krasnogorsk Plant-produced AP-402M panoramic camera--in the 
lower section, the A-100 oblique AFA [aerial camera] of that 
same plant--in the lower section of the fuselage right behind 
the cockpit, and the Geofizika NPO-developed infrared system--in 
the lower central section of the fuselage. A pod with the 
Shpil-2M laser device, developed at the radio optics scientific 
research institute, is hung on the central ventral suspension 
point, and a pod with the Efir-1M radiation reconnaissance 
device--on the right external underwing suspension point. 
  The Shtyk radar provides a view of a zone that is 24 
kilometers wide on each side from the line of flight with an 8 
kilometer-wide nonviewed section (directly under the aircraft), 
a flight altitude of 100-3,000 meters during radar 
reconnaissance, and resolution of 5-7.5 meters.

  There are no aircraft similar to the Su-24MR reconnaissance 
aircraft among foreign frontal aviation reconnaissance aircraft 
based upon comprehensiveness of the reconnaissance information 
obtained. For example, AN/AAS-18 infrared equipment, the 
AN/APQ-102 side-looking radar, and several aerial cameras for 
mapping and oblique photography from high and low altitudes are 
utilized on the RF-4C aircraft that make up the foundation of 
U.S. Air Force tactical reconnaissance aviation; the AIL 
AN/ALQ-61 or Litton AN/ALQ-25 pod systems are utilized for 
SIGINT reconnaissance, but there are no laser or radiation 
reconnaissance systems, and the American reconnaissance aircraft 
is lighter and, with a fixed swept swing, substantially lags 
behind the Su-24MR in flight range and speed at low altitudes. 
Based upon flight specifications, the British GR.1A Tornado 
reconnaissance aircraft, which was also modified from a fighter 
bomber with a variable sweep wing, approximates the Su-24MR but 
the GR.1A Tornado was conceived as a reconnaissance aircraft 
with retention of combat capabilities and is equipped only with 
the TIRRS panoramic and side-looking infrared reconnaissance 
system instead of cannons. 
  The collected photo information is delivered by dropping 
photo materials that have been exposed on board and the 
remaining reconnaissance information is efficiently transmitted 
to the ground via wideband and narrow band radio channels. All 
information is supplied with navigation data for tying it in 
with aircraft location coordinates and time. Reception, 
processing, and decryption of the obtained reconnaissance 
information at the ground site is conducted in real time. On the 
British GR.1A Tornado, the reconnaissance information received 
is recorded on videotape and can be reproduced on a small TV 
display in the navigator-operator's cockpit in near real time 
(the Tornado is the first aircraft in the NATO countries' air 
forces with this capability), however, during the Persian Gulf 
War in 1991, navigators rarely utilized the capability to 
monitor reconnaissance information because they were completely 
loaded down with carrying out navigation tasks and with 
monitoring the threat from enemy surface-to-air missile 
complexes. 
  External fuel tanks with a capacity of 3,000 liters each 
have 
been installed on the Su-24MR aircraft's internal underwing 
suspension points, two R-60 (AA-8 Aphid) close-range infrared 
seeking air-to- air missiles (for self-defense) have been 
installed on the left external underwing suspension point. 
<H5>  The Su-25 Ground Attack Aircraft </H5>
  The new Su-25TK aircraft was demonstrated at 
"Mosaeroshow-92." It was developed at the ANPK imeni P.O. Sukhoy 
based on the Su-25 ground attack aircraft which is being widely 
utilized by the air forces of the CIS countries, Czechoslovakia 
(50 ground attack aircraft have been delivered), Hungary (50), 
Iraq (25), the DPRK (20), and Syria (60), and has been produced 
at Tbilisi Aircraft Plant since 1976. 
  The first Su-25T flight took place in August 1984. By the 
end 
of 1991, eight of the 10 ordered test ground attack aircraft had 
been built. Series production of the aircraft is being 
established at a plant in Ulan-Ude. 
  The ground attack aircraft's fuselage approximates the 
configuration of the fuselage of the Su-25UB two-seater combat 
trainer aircraft. The avionics are located in a large capacity 
fuselage fairing. An increased capacity fuel tank that is 
screened by the engines from the sides has been installed in the 
central section of the fuselage. The experience of combat 
employment of Su-25 ground attack aircraft in Afghanistan has 
been realized in the aircraft design: the central section of the 
fuselage has been reinforced and the engines' IR signature has 
been significantly reduced. 
  Two Ufa Engine Building Production Association R-195 TRD 
[turbojet engines] (2 x 45 kN) have been installed on the 
Su-25T, which have increased thrust in contrast to the initial 
engines.

  It has an automated aircraft control system that ensures 
access to the target in simple and complex weather conditions at 
any time of the day with high accuracy. 
  The ground attack aircraft is equipped with an I-251 weapons 
aiming system that was developed by Krasnogorsk's Zenit OMZ for 
automatic identification and automatic tracking of small targets 
(tanks, motor vehicles, small craft, etc.), transmission of 
target designation and automatic guidance of guided missiles, 
and also for fire control. 
  The system consists of the Shkval day optical-electronic 
system located in the nose section of the aircraft, which 
includes television channels with fields of view of 27 x 36 and 
0.7 x 10 and 23-fold magnification, and also a laser 
rangefinder-target designator installed on a single platform 
that is stabilized for pitch, bank, and yaw and have angles of 
vertical guidance in a range from +15 to -80, and 
horizontal guidance from +35 to -35. Furthermore, the 
system also has automatic target tracking and target designation 
systems, guided missiles with self- homing, control of antitank 
guided missiles using laser guidance, sighting line 
stabilization, and a BTsVM [onboard digital computer]. For 
operations at night the I-251 system can be supplemented by the 
Merkuriy IR-imaging system, which is mounted in a pod installed 
on an external ventral suspension point. The pod's cross section 
is close to a right angle and its forward portion is covered by 
a hatch that protects the optics during take-off and landing. 
The IR system has a lens with wide and narrow (5.5 x 7.3) 
fields of view (the night channel's optical system is not 
stabilized). Detection range and target lock-on by the day 
channel television system is 10 km, the night system--somewhat 
less. 
  Video information of the day television channel and night 
channel with a narrow field of view is displayed on a monochrome 
CRT that has been installed in the right upper portion of the 
aircraft cockpit instrument panel and the night channel with the 
broad field of view--on an ILS [head-up display--HUD]. 
  The process of navigation and attacking a target has been 
automated to the maximum extent possible by the Su-25T. The 
aircraft automatically enters the target area, the television 
system, oriented beforehand in the required direction, begins to 
operate 10 km from it, then the pilot carries out monitoring of 
the selection and lock-on of the target, after which the system 
shifts to automatic tracking. After the pilot presses the combat 
button, the system carries out selection of the required 
munitions and conducts their launch. After the first run to the 
target, the aircraft can carry out a repeat run in the automatic 
mode or, based on the pilot's desire, return to base (the pilot 
can take control of the aircraft only directly prior to landing). 
  Based on the assessments of OKB imeni P.O. Sukhoy 
representatives, the Su-25TK aircraft with the I-251 weapons 
aiming system outstrips similar developments abroad by five to 
six years (only one foreign single-seat aircraft--the General 
Dynamics series 40 F-16C fighter- bomber--is being equipped with 
the LANTIRN optical-electronic system). 
  The Su-25T's defensive systems consist of an ELINT 
reconnaissance system, identification, suppression, and 
destruction of radars, and dispensing chaff using missiles with 
IR and radar guidance. Pods with 192 IR decoys and chaff and 
also an IR jamming generator in the tail section of the ground 
attack aircraft under the vertical stabilizer have been 
installed on the aircraft. 
  The SU-25TK aircraft's weaponry consists of Kh-58 
antiradiation guided missiles (in the future, they propose 
equipping it with the more powerful Kh-31P antiradiation 
missile), the Kh-25ML guided missile with a laser guidance 
system, and also the Vikhr antitank system which, according to 
the assertions of OKB representatives, has no equals in the 
world. The missile with a high supersonic speed and launch range 
of up to 10 km has a tandem shaped-charge warhead that is 
capable of piercing modern multilayer or active armor with an 
equivalent thickness of up to 1,000 mm (the guided missile can 
destroy the most powerful American M-1A2 Abrams tank in the 
forward projection). Thanks to the missile's high speed, several 
targets can be destroyed in a single run. An APU-8 aircraft 
launcher contains eight Vikhr guided missiles in a 
transport-launch canister that is hung under the aircraft wing. 
  The Su-25TK aircraft's typical combat load is 16 Vikhr 
guided 
missiles. 
  The guided missile's high specifications permit the complex 
to be employed not only against ground-based but also against 
airborne targets (a videotape that was shown during the 
exhibition showed how a Vikhr guided missile destroyed a Tu-16 
target-aircraft in the air).

  The Su-25TK aircraft that was displayed on the ramp was 
armed 
with a new guided missile with a laser guidance system that was 
developed based on the S-25 heavy NAR [unguided rockets]. 
  Besides guided missile weapons, the ground attack aircraft 
can be equipped with 80-370 mm unguided rockets, conventional 
and guided aircraft bombs, and air-to-air missiles with an IR 
guidance system. 
  Built-in weaponry consists of a 30 mm cannon installed in 
the 
open under the fuselage (in contrast to the GSh-302 cannon 
employed on the Su-25 aircraft, the new gun supports a round 
with a higher muzzle velocity, and has greater range and firing 
accuracy). 
  The Su-25T was demonstrated for the first time at the 
international air exhibition in the Principality of Dubai 
(Arabian Peninsula) in the autumn of 1991.

<H5>  Aircraft of the OKB imeni S.V. Ilyushin </H5>
<H5>  The IL-102 Ground Attack Aircraft </H5>
  The Il-102 prototype ground attack aircraft developed at the 
OKB imeni S.V. Ilyushin was displayed at the exhibition for the 
first time. Work on the program began in the mid-1970's and was 
conducted simultaneously with the development of the T-8 (Su-25) 
aircraft at the OKB imeni P.O. Sukhoy. The Il-102 ground attack 
aircraft is the further development of the Il-40, the first 
Soviet ground attack aircraft with a turbojet engine, developed 
in 1953. Two Il-102 aircraft were built, one of which was 
intended for the conduct of static tests. The ground attack 
aircraft's first flight took place in 1982 and pilots S.G. 
Bliznyuk and V.S. Belousov conducted the flight tests (more than 
200 flights were conducted). The aircraft underwent state 
testing; however, a decision on series production was not made, 
which is partially explained by the presence in the Air Force 
inventory of the Su-25 aircraft, which has similar 
characteristics. 
  The Il-102 ground attack aircraft was manufactured according 
to a normal aerodynamic design with a low swept wing. The Il-40 
aircraft's specific configuration features were preserved: the 
crew, consisting of two men, and the fuel tanks and two engines 
located in an armored box in the central section near the 
aircraft's center of mass, which permitted them to decrease the 
area of armor and improve the ground attack aircraft's 
maneuvering characteristics. 
  The aircraft's wing is swept and has a relatively thick 
section permitting six bomb compartments to be "inscribed" into 
the wing near the root section which are capable of 
accommodating munitions of up to 250 kg (the diameter of a bomb 
must not exceed 325 mm). The wing tips have been canted downward 
(a place has been provided for installing pods with IR decoys in 
their facing portion). It has simple twin-section flaps. The 
ailerons have a pointed leading edge and trim and balance tabs. 
Twin-section spoilers have been located in the wing's upper 
surface. The stabilizer is equipped with a horn-balance elevator 
tab and trim and balance tabs. The swept tail fairing with a 
developed dorsal fin has a rudder with horn balance and 
triple-section servo balance. 
  The fuselage has a characteristic "hump" in which the 
pilots' 
and gunner's cockpits, part of the avionics equipment, and the 
fuel tanks are located (large removable panels that facilitate 
access to the equipment are located between the pilots' and 
gunner's cockpits). Two speed brakes have been installed in the 
tail section along the sides of the fuselage. The forward and 
rear cockpits have flat armored glass. Cockpit equipment is 
traditional with electromechanical instruments equipped with 
circular scales. The tricycle landing gear provides the 
capability to operate the aircraft from dirt runways that are 
capable of supporting a specific pressure of 5 
kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. The rearward retracting single- wheel nose 
gear (5th model tire, 70 x 330) is set far ahead and provides 
good anti-nose-over characteristics. It has twin-wheel primary 
landing gears with model 10A tires (930 x 305) that are 
retracted into a fairing under the wing. 
  A total of 4,000 kg of fuel is located in six tanks located 
in the central portion of the fuselage and protected by armor. 
Two external fuel tanks weighing 800 kg each can be installed on 
two ventral external suspension points. The aircraft's power 
plant consists of two RD-33I turbojet bypass engines (2 x 52 kN, 
a non- afterburner variant of the RD-33 turbojet bypass engine 
with afterburner that is installed on the MiG-29 fighter 
aircraft). They propose the employment of a thrust vector 
deflection and reverse system. 
  An S-17BTs collimating gunsight has been installed in the 
pilot's cockpit and the possibility of utilizing a radar 
gunsight and optical-electronic sighting systems has been 
provided for. The gunner is equipped with a KPS-53-A weapons 
aiming system that includes a PAU-475-2M gunsight with a range 
finder and computer. K- 36L ejection seats, developed at Zvezda 
OKB under the leadership of G. Severin, have been installed in 
the aircraft. 
  Cannon weaponry consists of a twin-barrel 30 mm cannon that 
turns in the vertical plane with a combat load of 500 rounds and 
a GSh-23 rear defensive cannon on a mobile turret (23 mm, 60 
rounds) that is remotely controlled by the gunner. Missile-bomb 
weaponry with a total weight of 7,200 kg is located on 16 
suspension points (including on six internal wing suspension 
points) and includes R- 60M and R-72 air-to-air guided missiles 
with IR guidance, 100-500 kg aircraft bombs, pods with various 
types of unguided rockets, canisters for small cargoes, and 
other weaponry.

<H5>  Variants of the MiG-29 Fighter Aircraft </H5>
  Besides the well-known modification of the MiG-29 frontal 
aviation fighter based upon previous demonstrations, two new 
variants were displayed for the first time at "Mosaeroshow-92": 
The MiG-29KVP and the MiG-29K. 
  The TTT [tactical-technical specifications] for the MiG-29 
aircraft were published in 1972, the technical design began in 
1974, and the first of 11 prototype aircraft built completed its 
first flight on 6 October 1977. Series production began in 1982 
and was carried out at plants in Moscow (MAPO) and Nizhniy 
Novgorod. The MiG-29 began to enter the inventory in 1983. Over 
500 aircraft were in the inventory of the countries of the 
former USSR by the beginning of 1992. Furthermore, the MiG-29 
has been supplied to Cuba, Czechoslovakia, the GDR, India, Iran, 
Iraq, North Korea, Poland, Romania, Syria, and Yugoslavia.

  The MiG-29KVP is an intermediate variant built to work out 
take-off from a ski jump and landing on an arresting gear. It 
can be utilized both as a combat aircraft or as a training 
aircraft for carrier aviation pilots at ground-based airfields. 
The only difference from a normal ground-based aircraft is the 
arresting hook and the reinforced design. 
  The MiG-29K is a carrier-based fighter-bomber. Its testing 
began during operations from the deck of the Admiral of the 
Fleet of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov heavy aircraft-carrying 
cruiser in November 1990. It has a folding wing, arresting hook, 
and structurally reinforced landing gear and fuselage tail 
section. The doors of the air intake foreign object protection 
system that were used on previous variants of the aircraft have 
been replaced with lighter retractable grates and the auxiliary 
upper air intakes have been removed and additional fuel tanks 
have been installed instead of them; still, the walls of the air 
intakes in the landing gear well area have been perforated to 
improve foreign object protection of the air intakes. The wing 
has eight load-bearing suspension points. The new Zhuk radar is 
located in the nose fairing with a new, single curvature 
profile. There are no overwing dorsal fins in which packages of 
chaff and IR flares were previously located. The aircraft that 
was displayed had Kh-31 antiradiation missiles on internal 
pylons and R-73 air-to-air missiles on internal pylons [as 
published]. 
  The overall architecture of the weapons control system is 
just like on the initial ground-based MiG-29. There are no 
similar weapons control systems abroad, and there is no similar 
optical radar equipment which operates autonomously and along 
with other onboard systems. The MiG-29K has a new 
optical-electronic radar, improved sensor cooling, and increased 
target detection range. It has an aerial refueling system, the 
intake probe of which is located on the port side ahead of the 
cockpit. 
  The Zhuk multifunction onboard radar was developed by the 
Fazotron Concern. It has high effectiveness and reliability with 
comparatively low weight and can operation in the "air-to-air" 
and "air-to-surface" modes. The Zhuk radar mock-up was shown for 
the first time at the 1989 Paris Air Show. By the summer of 
1992, 10 prototype radars had been built and flight tests are 
nearing completion. In the words of Fazotron Deputy Chief 
Designer V. Antonov, the Zhuk radar is lighter than the radar 
installed on the MiG-29 at the present time, is linked with 
additional weaponry, has a track-while-scan mode, and is capable 
of supporting simultaneous firing against up to four targets 
using missiles with active guidance (the existing MiG-29 
aircraft radar permits attacking only one target at a time). 
  In June 1991, an operational and technical assessment of the 
MiG-29 aircraft was completed in Germany and the German Ministry 
of Defense announced its intention to retain in the inventory 
the 20 MiG-29 single-seat air superiority fighters and four 
MiG-29UB two-seat trainer aircraft that had been previously 
delivered to the GDR. It is assumed that they will be operated 
until approximately 2002, each of which will have 2,500 flying 
hours by that time. In addition to the initial role of ensuring 
the air defense of the eastern sector of Germany from Preschen 
Airfield near the border with Poland, the MiG-29 aircraft of JG9 
Squadron will be utilized as simulated enemy aircraft during 
Luftwaffe and other NATO forces exercises. MiG-29 and F-15 and 
F-16 air combat training has been conducted, including in the 
autumn of 1990 within the framework of preparing for the war 
with Iraq. 
  In the opinion of Lieutenant General H.-J. Kubart, German 
Air 
Force commander in chief, the MiG's can operate normally until 
2002-2003, although he also expressed his concern about 
supplying the German MiG-29 squadron with spare parts. The low 
service life of the early model RD-33 engines that were 
installed on them (the mean time between repair equals only 350 
hours, but total service life can total 600 hours) is cited 
among the shortcomings of the German MiG- 29's. As a result, a 
low MiG-29 readiness coefficient was noted in the first stage of 
mastering the aircraft in the FRG: only six of 24 aircraft were 
combat ready in December 1991. In January 1992, the level of 
combat readiness was doubled but was still inadequately high. 
Representatives of the Russian plant who service the engines and 
guarantee an increase of service life by 50-100 hours were sent 
to the FRG. 
  The Finnish Air Force organized a competition for a new 
fighter aircraft in 1991-1992. The Mirage 2000-5, the JAS-39, 
the F-16, and the F/A-18 aircraft participated in it and the 
MiG-29 fighter aircraft was viewed as a fifth "shadow" 
candidate. In the words of Major General H. Nikunen, Finnish Air 
Force commander in chief, the MiG-29 has good flight 
specifications but inadequately high efficiency and operating 
technology. Furthermore, the general expressed doubts in 
Russia's capability to provide the aircraft with spare parts and 
offer the required barter compensations (the Finnish side will 
pay for the entire shipment of aircraft with counter deliveries 
of their own goods). 
  Since 1991, further deliveries of MiG-29's to the Soviet Air 
Force have been terminated in order "to prevent many types of 
aircraft with an identical mission." But production for export 
is possible. Export sales attempts through intermediaries are 
well known. The lack of sophistication of domestic sales 
structures is one of the causes of the poor aircraft sales (in 
the words of General Designer R.A. Belyakov, not a single 
aircraft was sold abroad in 1991, although there are more than 
50 undelivered MiG-29's at MAPO worth approximately $1 billion). 
To improve the situation, the KB [design bureau] has organized 
the firm MIGservis, uniting the KB with the Znamya truda 
manufacturing plant and cooperating with only one foreign trade 
organization which must issue the license for aircraft sales. It 
is assumed that the developer will have definite proceeds from 
the sale of the aircraft. On 4 June 1992, the Russian Supreme 
Soviet adopted a draft edict authorizing MAPO to independently 
carry out marketing of MiG-29 aircraft. Furthermore, during the 
exhibition an agreement was signed on the creation of a joint 
venture with a German firm to render assistance in the operation 
of the MiG-29's that are in the German inventory. 
  Sale of the MiG-29, like other military equipment, is being 
restricted for political reasons. Taiwan's deputy minister of 
foreign affairs, studying the possibility of purchasing 90 
MiG-29 aircraft for Taiwan's Air Force, recently visited Russia 
but received a refusal from Russia along with several Western 
countries to which Taiwan had turned with a similar request for 
the sale of modern aircraft. 
  Demonstration of the aircraft at various air shows by the 
"Swift" aerobatics team, recently formed at Kubinka Airfield and 
flying MiG- 29 aircraft, is helping to market it. Many foreign 
pilots and experts, to whom the opportunity was presented to 
complete familiarization flights in the aircraft, have noted the 
aircraft's high specifications. 
<H5>  The MiG-25 Aircraft </H5>
  The MiG-25RB reconnaissance-bomber aircraft, displayed on 
the 
ramp and in the air, is designed to conduct imaging and radar 
reconnaissance from high altitudes and conduct bombing strikes 
against fixed targets. 
  Work on the development of this aircraft began in 1958 when 
the OKB imeni A.I. Mikoyan began to study a high-altitude 
reconnaissance aircraft that was capable of executing missions 
with which the Lockheed U-2 and Martin/General Dynamics RB-57F 
aircraft were tasked in the United States. During the course of 
the work, a multimission aircraft was developed that was capable 
of carrying out various combat missions. 
  MiG-25 strike reconnaissance aircraft were employed in 
combat 
operations in the Middle East in 1982 and in the Iran-Iraq 
conflict, practically without combat losses (several aircraft 
were lost as a result of accidents or unskilled tactical 
utilization when missions that were not characteristic to the 
aircraft were assigned to them). Iraqi MiG-25 aircraft were 
successfully employed to destroy Iranian oil terminals 
(relatively small targets), conducting bombing using INS from 
high altitudes at supersonic speed. During the Persian Gulf War, 
the Iraqi side practically did not utilize MiG-25 
reconnaissance-strike aircraft. 
  The following modifications of the reconnaissance and 
reconnaissance-strike aircraft were developed: The MiG-25R 
(1966)-- high-altitude, high-speed, reconnaissance aircraft; the 
MiG-25RBK (1972-1980), the MiG-25RBS (1972-1977), the MiG-25RBV 
(1978), the MiG-25RBT (1978), the MiG-25RBF (a reconfigured 
MiG-25RBK, 1981), the MiG-25RBSh (a reconfigured MiG-25RBS, 
1981)--strike reconnaissance aircraft; the MiG-25BM 
(1982-1985)--a strike-defense suppression aircraft; and the 
MiG-25RU (1972)--a trainer aircraft. 
  High temperatures caused by kinetic heating of the structure 
required the involvement of many enterprises during the 
development of the aircraft, ensuring the development of special 
steels, heat- resistant glass, seals, rubbers, sealants, glues, 
and other promising design materials. Approximately 80% 
of the 
aircraft structure was made from steel, 8% from titanium 
alloys, 11% from aluminum alloys and, 1% from 
other materials. 
  Aircraft equipment is linked into a single system and 
includes an INS (the first in series-production tactical strike 
aircraft), an onboard digital computer, a Doppler slip and drift 
sensor (DISS), a Peleng bombing system that conducts the 
automatic release of bombs at assigned coordinates, an ASU-155 
automated command and control system, and an SPS-141 electronic 
warfare system (MiG-25RBT). Reconnaissance equipment consists of 
an A-72 and A-10-10 aerial cameras (on the MiG-25R and 
MiG-25RB), and a Virazh SRS-4A and SRS- 4B (MiG-25R and 
MiG-25RB), the SRS-9 (MiG-25RB), and the Kub MiG- 25RBK) and 
Sablya (MiG-25RBS) side-looking radar systems (RLSBO). 
  MiG-25 reconnaissance-bomber aircraft weaponry consists of 
up 
to 4,000 kg of 500 kg bombs on four underwing external 
suspension points that can be employed at high supersonic 
speeds. The MiG-25BM defense suppression aircraft is equipped 
with four Kh-58 guided missiles (launch range of more than 40 
km). 
  The reconnaissance-bomber aircraft was series produced in 
1969-1984 at the aircraft plant at Nizhniy Novgorod (Gorkiy). 
Series production of the aircraft was terminated in 1984 and 
reconfiguration of previously built aircraft into the MiG-25BM 
variant continued until 1985. 
  At the present time, the OKB has developed variants for the 
modernization of the MiG-25 aircraft that ensure the increase of 
its combat effectiveness due to the introduction of aerial 
refueling, new guided weaponry, avionics, and electronic warfare 
systems.

<H5>  The MiG-31 Interceptor Aircraft </H5>
  The MiG-31 aircraft, developed based upon the MiG-25P 
fighter- interceptor aircraft, is designed for use in the PVO 
system and is capable of carrying out prolonged patrols and 
conducting combat with all classes of aerodynamic targets 
(including small cruise missiles, helicopters, and Lockheed 
SR-71 class high-altitude, high-speed aircraft) at any time of 
day, in complex weather conditions, and under intense conduct of 
electronic warfare. 
  In 1972 the OKB began work on an improved variant of the 
MiG-25 fighter aircraft that received the designation Ye-155MP 
(Item 83, MiG-25MP) and was designed to combat both 
high-altitude and also low-flying targets with a reduced RCS. 
The first flight of this aircraft took place on 16 September 
1975 (test pilot A. Fedotov). In contrast to the initial 
aircraft, the crew of the new fighter- interceptor consisted of 
two men and the Zaslon radar gunsight was included as part of 
the avionics. Zaslon had been developed since the beginning of 
the 1960's for the Tu-148 long-range variable geometry wing 
interceptor which had been proposed to replace the Tu- 128 
aircraft. 
  Series production of the MiG-31 fighter aircraft began in 
1979 at an aircraft plant in Nizhniy Novgorod (Gorkiy), the 
first aviation unit based at Pravdinsk was equipped with the new 
fighter aircraft in 1980, and the MiG-31 completed state testing 
in December 1981. In June 1991 the aircraft was demonstrated for 
the first time at the Paris Air Show and was exhibited at the 
International Air Show in Dubai in the autumn of 1991. 
  Structurally, the MiG-31 fighter aircraft is close to the 
MiG-25. Its airframe is 50% manufactured from stainless 
steel, 
16% from titanium, 33% from aluminum alloys, and 
1% from 
other construction materials. There are small extensions in the 
root section of the wing. Onboard equipment permits the 
utilization of the MiG-31 fighter-interceptor aircraft 
autonomously, as part of a group of identical aircraft or as an 
aircraft-leader for command and control of fighter operations 
that have less improved avionics (the MiG-23, MiG-25, MiG-29, 
Su-27, or Su-15). 
  The aircraft is equipped with the Zaslon SBI-16 
pulse-Doppler 
radar with a high-power phased-array antenna (the diameter of 
the antenna, installed fixed, is 1.1 meters). The MiG-31 is the 
first (and, so far, the only) series production fighter aircraft 
in the world with a phased-array antenna that has only 
electronic scanning (an antenna of this type has been developed 
for the fifth generation F-22 aircraft and the Rafale C). 
  Maximum detection range of a target with an RCS of 16 
m[.sup]2[/] is 200 km, tracking range of an AWACS aircraft 
class target--120 km, fighter class target--90 km in the forward 
hemisphere and 120 and 70 km, respectively, in the rear 
hemisphere. The radar's horizontal search sector is 140 (in 
certain modes--240, that is, it provides surveillance both 
in the forward and in the rear hemispheres), and the vertical 
search sector is +70/-60. 
  The radar permits detection and destruction of aircraft 
(including low-observables), helicopters, and cruise missiles in 
the upper hemisphere and in the background of the surface, 
carries out simultaneous tracking of up to 10 targets, and 
simultaneous guidance of guided missiles to four targets. In 
contrast to the American Grumman F-14 Tomcat fighter aircraft 
which is capable of track- while-scan and simultaneously guiding 
AIM-54 Phoenix guided missiles to various targets in a 
relatively narrow sector (+/-20), the MiG-31 aircraft radar 
can operate in these modes practically in the entire search 
sector. 
  The MiG-31 fighter is equipped with infrared radar on an 
extendible base permitting it to carry out a search and employ 
weapons without revealing its location, and also to operate 
under conditions of intensive electronic jamming. 
  A group of four MiG-31 aircraft is capable of controlling 
airspace 800-900 km along the front. An APD-518 digital 
encrypted communications system supports the exchange of radar 
information in a group of four MiG-31 aircraft at a distance of 
up to 200 km from each other and guidance to a target of a group 
of fighters that have less sophisticated avionics. An RK-RLDN 
digital encrypted data exchange link supports coordination with 
ground-based command posts. Utilization of the APD-518 system 
ensures stealthy attack of a target by a MiG-31 aircraft while 
the target is being tracked by another fighter aircraft located 
a safe distance from enemy aircraft and relaying radar 
information to the attacking aircraft. 
  A large-format tactical situation display has been installed 
in the operator's cockpit and the pilot's cockpit is equipped 
with a PPI- 70V color head-up display developed by Voskhod MPKB, 
which has no series-produced foreign equals at the present time. 
Navigational equipment includes a Tropik radar-navigation system 
(Loran, accuracy of the determination of coordinates is 0.13-1.3 
km at a distance of 2,000 km) and a Marshrut (Omega, accuracy of 
the determination of coordinates is 1.8-3.6 km at a distance of 
2,000-10,000 km). It provides the capability to employ the 
aircraft in the Arctic TVD [theater of military operations]. 
  It has an aerial refueling system with a retractable probe. 
The aircraft is equipped with a bogie undercarriage that permits 
operation from dirt runways (which is especially important 
during operation of the aircraft in unconquered areas of Siberia 
where there is no developed runway network). The fighter is 
equipped with D-30F6 turbojet bypass engines with afterburner (2 
x 9 270/155 kN, dry weight 2,420 kg), development of which began 
in 1972. 
  The MiG-31 aircraft's weaponry includes R-33 long-range 
guided missiles (launch range--120 km) located on four external 
semirecessed suspension points under the fuselage, R-40T medium- 
range guided missiles with an IR homing system, and the R-60, 
R-60M, or R-73 close-range guided missiles on four underwing 
suspension points. A six-barrel GSh-23-6 cannon (23 mm, 260 
rounds, rate of fire 8,000 rounds per minute, weight of round 
200 grams, muzzle velocity 700 meters per second) has been 
installed under the fuselage, the firing port of which is 
covered by a special hatch in the nonoperating position which 
improves aerodynamics and reduces the aircraft's RCS. 
  The MiG-31M fighter-interceptor was demonstrated at the 
aircraft demonstration for the CIS countries leaders at 
Machulishchi (Belarus) in the winter of 1992. In contrast to the 
initial variant, a more powerful radar has been installed on the 
modernized fighter, weaponry has been increased and consists of 
six long-range guided missiles located on semirecessed 
suspension points under the fuselage and the highly maneuverable 
RVV-AE medium-range guided missiles on underwing suspension 
points. The aircraft wing has increased area extensions, the 
dimensions of the fuselage fairing have been increased, and the 
pilot cockpit's forward windshield has been manufactured in one 
piece. 
  The U.S. Navy's F-14 Tomcat carrier-based interceptor, 
designed to provide air defense for aircraft carriers, is the 
closest fighter to the MiG-31 by mission. The MiG-31 aircraft 
significantly exceeds the American aircraft in maximum speed and 
ceiling, and has approximately identical ferry range with it and 
comparable onboard radar capabilities. Until 1990 the Harris 
AN/ASW-27B communications system was utilized on the F-14A 
fighter aircraft, providing an automated exchange of information 
only between fighter aircraft and shipborne command posts or 
E-2C Hawkeye AWACS aircraft which performed the role of relays 
and could transmit information, received by the F-14 fighter's 
onboard radar, to other fighters that were part of the group. 
The AN/ASW-27C digital communications system which provides 
exchange of information in the automatic mode between four 
aircraft began to be installed on F-14 aircraft only at the end 
of 1991.

  According to foreign data, there were more than 200 MiG-31 
fighter- interceptors in the inventory of the CIS countries' PVO 
troops at the beginning of 1992 and another 24 aircraft of this 
type were delivered to China. 
<H5>  The MiG-23 Aircraft </H5>
  Demonstrated at the exhibition, the MiG-23MLD aircraft is 
the 
latest modification of the MiG-23 fighter aircraft family and 
that was one of the Soviet Air Force's primary frontal aviation 
fighter aircraft for a long time. Work on the development of the 
new generation aircraft to replace the MiG-21 frontal aviation 
fighter aircraft began at the OKB imeni A.I. Mikoyan in 1961. 
The MiG-23 was developed as a comparatively cheap aircraft 
capable of being effectively employed in local conflicts, for 
air defense of individual major targets, and also supplied for 
export. 
  A great deal of work, conducted by the OKB in cooperation 
with TsAGI, preceded the development of the MiG-23MLD. The 
assigned task was to substantially improve the aircraft's 
maneuverability and handling at high angles of attack since 
success in a dogfight depends to a significant degree on mastery 
of those regimes. Several configurations of the new aircraft 
were studied, differentiated by the dimensions and shape of the 
wing glove leading-edge assembly and the shape of the vertical 
tail. The selected configuration provided a substantial 
improvement of maneuverability with minimal modification of the 
airframe. 
  A second "tooth" extension was made on the MiG-23MLD 
aircraft's wing root, a vortex generator shaped like a small 
(365 mm long) plate with sharp edges was installed on the PVD 
[pitot tube], and it became possible to set the 
computer-controlled deflecting wing leading edge slats to the 
optimal position depending on the flight regime. 
  The fighter is equipped with an improved radar that is 
capable of simultaneously detecting and tracking several 
airborne targets and an improved automated command and control 
system from the ground in which a jam-proof data transmission 
link is utilized. An automated system prevents engine stall 
during missile launch and firing from the cannon. A close-range 
mode has been introduced in the radar and the pilot is equipped 
with a helmet-mounted target designation system. 
  Besides the development of ground-based aircraft, work was 
conducted on the MiG-23A carrier-based modification designed for 
deployment on a nuclear aircraft-carrying ship with catapult 
take-off, developed under the codename Orel since the beginning 
of the 1970's. However, cessation of work on Project Orel in 
1977 resulted in the termination of work on the MiG-23A fighter 
aircraft. Later, one of the MiG-23M series aircraft was 
reconfigured into a flying laboratory and used at the LII imeni 
Gromov to develop landing techniques on ship decks and also to 
develop the fundamental elements of a ship aircraft technical 
system (ATSK) including an optical landing system, various 
radiotechnical systems, etc. The aircraft was equipped with an 
arresting hook, which entailed changing the shape and increasing 
the area of the ventral fin. A movie camera that recorded the 
pilot's face during take-off and landing with high G-loads was 
installed in the cockpit instead of a collimating gunsight. In 
1980 a scientific-research complex with a ski jump, arresting 
gear, and a prototype catapult, where flight tests of the MiG-23 
flying laboratory were also conducted, was put into operation in 
the area of Saki (the Crimea). Materials obtained during tests 
were utilized in the work on the MiG-29K and Su-27K aircraft 
designed for the Admiral Kuznetsov and Varyag heavy 
aircraft-carrying ships with ski jump take-off. 
  Developed in 1973, the export variant of the MiG-23MS 
fighter 
with simplified avionics (specifically, the Sapfir-21 radar) 
gained wide sales because it had high LTKh [flight technical 
specifications] with a relatively low cost. So, in 1980 prices, 
one MiG-23MS sold for $3.6-6.6 million at a time when IAI's 
[Israeli Aircraft Industries] Kfir C.2 aircraft, which lagged 
behind the MiG-23's combat capabilities, cost $4.5 million in 
1978 prices, the Mirage III--$6.5-7.5 million (1983 prices), the 
F-16A--$14 million (1980 prices), and they proposed selling the 
Northrop F-20, which was considered to be a cheap fighter, to 
foreign purchasers for $15 million (1985 prices). 
  By 1992, the MiG-23 was in the inventory of the air forces 
of 
Algeria (66 MiG-23MS, BN, and UB), Angola (80 MiG-23MF, BN, and 
UB), Bulgaria (48 MiG-23MF, BN, and UB), Cuba (40 MiG-23MS and 
BN), Czechoslovakia (80 MiG-23ML, BN, and UB), Egypt (16 
MiG-23MS and BN obtained in 1974 and partially transferred to 
the United States and China), Ethiopia (45 MiG-23BN), Hungary 
(25 MiG-23MF and UB), India (125 MiG-23MF, delivered in 1982 to 
counteract F-16 deliveries to Pakistan, MiG-23BN and MiG-23UB 
and, furthermore, the MiG-27L Bahadur aircraft are being series 
produced in India), Iraq (MiG- 23MS, MF, BN, and UB, the precise 
number after the termination of the war is not known), Libya 
(200 MiG-23MS, BN, and UB), the DPRK (60 MiG-23ML and UB), 
Poland (100 MiG-23MF and UB), South Yemen (25), Syria (175 
MiG-23MS, MF, MLD, and UB), and Vietnam (30). Furthermore, 110 
MiG-23MF, ML, BN, and UB aircraft passed into the possession of 
the FRG after the unification of the two Germanys. The PRC has 
two to three MiG-23's that were obtained from Egypt (the MiG 
aircraft were painstakingly studied by Chinese experts and many 
of their design solutions were utilized during the development 
of the J-8-II aircraft). Several MiG-23MS and MiG-23BN aircraft 
were transferred to the United States by the Egyptian Government 
at the end of the 1970's. The famous American General Robert S. 
Bond died in one of these aircraft (the flight was conducted 
within the framework of the Stealth Program: The U.S. Air Force 
was interested in how low-observable aircraft would be detected 
by Soviet fighter aircraft radars). In 1991 the Americans 
obtained several MiG-23ML aircraft from the FRG. 
  The first major combat clash with the participation of 
MiG-23's occurred on 19 September 1979 when Syrian MiG-23MS's 
attacked an Israeli RF-4 Phantom II over Lebanon; however, they 
did not achieve success. The Israeli invasion into Lebanon began 
in June 1982. On 10 June, 350 aircraft from both sides 
participated in a dogfight over the Bekaa River Valley. The 
Syrians lost 22 fighters (four MiG-23MF, eight MiG-23MS, and 10 
MiG-21BIS). Israeli aircraft losses totaled 10 aircraft. On the 
whole, from 6 through 11 June, when a cease-fire agreement was 
concluded, the Syrian Air Force shot down 23 aircraft and lost 
47 aircraft in dogfights. 
  At the end of 1982 a shipment of 50 MiG-23MLD's arrived in 
Syria which promoted a change of the qualitative correlation of 
forces in the air in favor of the Syrians. In December 1982, air 
engagements between Syrian and Israeli aircraft resumed, but 
this time success was with the Syrians: Their MiG-23MLD's shot 
down three Israeli F- 15 Eagle and one F-4 Phantom II fighter 
aircraft. 
  Angola was another theater of military operations in which 
the MiG- 23 was widely employed. In 1985, 50 MiG-23MF aircraft 
piloted by Cuban pilots were sent to that country. The aircraft 
were immediately rushed to the south of the country where they 
became involved in combat operations. The first MiG-23 aircraft 
was shot down by antiaircraft fire at the end of 1985 (according 
to other information, Republic of South Africa [RSA] Air Force 
aircraft shot it down). The Dassault-Breguet Mirage F1C and 
Mirage III fighter aircraft in the RSA Air Force inventory were 
the primary enemy in the air. According to a Western press 
report, several aircraft of these types were destroyed by 
Angolan and Cuban MiG-23 fighters armed with R-60 guided 
missiles. On the whole, the Angolan-Cuban Air Forces won and 
maintained supremacy in the air over the southern areas of the 
country. 
  MiG-23's of various modifications were widely utilized by 
Iraq in the war with Iran. The Iraqi Air Force had MiG-23MF and 
MiG-23MS fighters and MiG-23BN fighter-bombers at its disposal. 
Having aircraft of both Soviet and also Western manufacture 
(specifically, Mirage F-1EQ fighters), Iraq widely practiced the 
modernization of its aircraft fleet permitting the aircraft to 
utilize "alien" weaponry. So, the Mirage F-1EQ fighters were 
armed with Soviet Kh- 29L air-to-surface missiles with a laser 
guidance system and MiG- 23MF's were equipped with Magic R.550 
close-range air-to-air guided missiles. MiG-23MF's were utilized 
for air superiority and for interception of Iranian F-14A Tomcat 
aircraft (Iran utilized these fighter-interceptors, which have a 
long flight range, primarily as bombers and reconnaissance 
aircraft). 
  The 1991 Persian Gulf War was the last war in which MiG-23's 
participated. By the beginning of combat operations, Iraq had 90 
MiG-23MF and MiG-23BN aircraft, however Iraqi aircraft were 
utilized extremely passively and air engagements were solitary 
in nature. Altogether during the course of the war, U.S. 
fighters (according to Western data) shot down six MiG-23 
aircraft (all by F-15 fighters). There were no published reports 
in the Western press of American aircraft losses in engagements 
with MiG-23's, however, according to certain sources, MiG-23MF's 
shot down at least one F-16 utilizing R- 23 guided missiles. 
  MiG-23 aircraft can be modernized by equipping them with 
more 
modern weapons systems and avionics, which will permit them to 
maintain the combat capabilities of this fighter aircraft close 
to the level of foreign fourth generation fighter aircraft for a 
prolonged period of time.

<H5>  The MiG-27K Fighter-Bomber </H5>
  Demonstrated on the ramp, the MiG-27K fighter-bomber is a 
development of the MiG-23 frontal aviation fighter aircraft. In 
1969 the OKB imeni A.I. Mikoyan prepared a design of a light 
strike aircraft based upon the MiG-23S fighter aircraft. The new 
aircraft completed its first flight on 20 August 1970 (test 
pilot P.M. Ostapenko). In contrast to the MiG-23S fighter 
aircraft, the fighter-bomber, which received the designation 
MiG-23B, had a modernized fuselage nose section that provides an 
improved field of view in the ahead-below direction and was 
designed to conduct strikes against fixed ground-based targets 
in the enemy rear area and also ground attack operations using 
cannon and unguided rockets during the day. 
  The MiG-23B was equipped with a Fon laser rangefinder, a 
Sokol-23S gunsight system optimized for operations against 
ground-based targets from low altitudes that provides a dual 
standard error of 2.8% of range, and a KN-23 navigation 
system 
with an analog computer capable of "remembering" the coordinates 
of three route turning points (PPM) and four airfields at which 
the aircraft could complete a landing after a combat mission. 
The MiG-23B was equipped with a 23B automated command and 
control system (SAU) and a RV-5R radio altimeter. 
  The AL-21F-300 turbojet engine with afterburner (1 x 
8,000/112 kN) was employed on the fighter-bomber. The increase 
of the maximum take-off weight in contrast to the MiG-23S and 
the need to operate the troop direct support aircraft from 
ground airstrips resulted in the increase of the size of the 
wheels and the employment of reduced-pressure tires. 
  Bomb weaponry included up to 18 50-100 kg bombs or eight 500 
kg bombs on underwing and ventral hard points. Another weaponry 
variation includes four UB-32A unguided rocket pods with 32 S-5 
57 mm rockets or four more modern B-8M pods with 20 S-8 80 mm 
unguided rockets. Furthermore, Kh-23 guided missiles can be hung 
under the wing that are guided by a beam using Delta guidance 
equipment mounted on the left wing pylon. R-2S close-range 
guided missiles with an IR homing system are employed for 
self-defense. Cannon weaponry, like on the MiG-23S, consisted of 
a GSh-23L twin-barreled cannon with a firing rate of 
approximately 3,000 rounds per minute. 
  Series production of the aircraft was begun in 1971, 
however, 
after the manufacture of a small series at the Znamya truda MMZ 
[manufacturing plant], the production of a new modification 
fighter- bomber--the MiG-23BN ("32-23") was begun in which a 
wing similar to the MiG-23M fighter wing, the R-29B-300 engine 
(1 x 8,000/115 kN), and also the improved Sokol-23N 
navigation-bomb system were utilized. It had two additional 
external hard points in the tail section of the fuselage and 
reinforced armor of the sides of the cockpit. The MiG-23BN was 
built in a large series for deliveries for export (certain 
aircraft were reconfigured from MiG-23M fighters directly at Air 
Force repair facilities). The commonality of the design of the 
MiG-23M and the MiG-23BN totaled 80%. 
  Later, the MiG-23BM ("32-25", 1973) and the MiG-23BK 
("32-26", 1974) fighter bombers were developed, which are 
distinguished by their avionics (specifically, the PrNK-23 that 
was installed on the MiG- 23BM had a digital computer instead of 
the analog computer that was installed on earlier modifications 
of the aircraft). 
  Reduction of the requirement for the speed characteristic of 
the fighter-bomber that is designed primarily for operations at 
low altitudes with transonic speed permitted them to reject the 
use of a variable air intake on the next modification of the 
strike aircraft, which was given the designation MiG-27, which 
simplified and facilitated the design of the airframe. 
  The MiG-27 aircraft, built in 1973, was designed for 
operations against fixed and mobile ground-based targets. 
Bombing was ensured even when the target was not visible, 
including in difficult regimes, when weapons of two different 
types are used during a single run. The capability for a repeat 
automatic run over the target was provided for. 
  Besides installing armored plates along the sides of the 
cockpit, the MiG-27 aircraft's combat survivability was ensured 
by pressurizing the fuel tanks with a neutral gas. 
  V.Ye. Menitskiy completed the first flight in the new 
aircraft and A.V. Fedotov, B.A. Orlov, A.G. Fastovets, T.O. 
Aubakirov, V.V. Ryndin, and other OKB and LII test pilots 
participated in the flight tests. Series production of the 
MiG-27 began at Irkutsk Aircraft Plant in 1973 and continued 
until 1977, a total of 560 aircraft of this type were produced. 
  The MiG-27 fighter-bomber's weaponry was supplemented with 
the Kh- 25MR guided missile with a radio command guidance 
system. Cannon weaponry was substantially increased and included 
the six-barrel GSh-30-6 30 mm cannon. The aircraft was equipped 
with an R-29F-300 turbojet engine with afterburner (8,000/115 
kN). 
  The avionics included a PrNK-23 with a digital processor 
(the 
system is capable of calculating the aircraft trajectory, 
artillery rounds fired from the onboard cannon, missiles, and 
bombs), a Fon laser rangefinder, a KN-23 navigation computer 
(capable of "keeping in memory" six route turning points and 
four airfields and providing a dual standard error under 
autonomous navigation of 1.0%), 6S RSBN [radio navigation 
system], an NI-50BM Doppler navigation radar, an SAU23B1, an 
RI-65 speech accident warning system that issues 16 different 
information reports and commands to the pilot in emergency 
situations that are recorded on a magnetic tape using a female 
voice (it has been established that a pleasant female voice 
reaches a pilot's consciousness more rapidly than male speech in 
a critical situation). 
  The MiG-27K modification that was developed in 1975 was a 
further development of the MiG-27 (it is this modification that 
was demonstrated at "Mosaeroshow-92"). 
  The aircraft is equipped with significantly improved 
avionics, specifically, the Kayra PrNK-23K. The optical head of 
the laser gunsight-rangefinder can be rotated in a limited 
sector (+/- 40 in azimuth, 130 in elevation), ensuring 
target tracking during aircraft maneuvers. While tracking an 
unseen target, the coordinates of which have been entered into 
the onboard computer, illumination was carried out in a 
programmed mode when the laser beam, which is constantly holding 
on the target, automatically adjusts to a certain angle 
depending on the speed of the aircraft's movement. A television 
camera was utilized to track the target and a monochrome 
television monitor was installed in the cockpit. The aircraft 
was equipped with an automated defensive system which included 
IR flare dispensers and chaff. 
  The MiG-27K's automated weapons control system provides 
automatic release of bombs, both individually and also in a 
series, and indication of the release of munitions and their 
presence onboard the aircraft. The MiG-27K became one of the 
first aircraft armed with improved precision-guided missiles 
with television and laser guidance systems, and also with guided 
bombs. The employment of missiles with laser guidance system in 
the programmed adjustable tracking mode (PKS) has been provided 
for. The MiG-27K is equipped with Kh-25MP missiles to combat 
enemy radars. 
  Other weaponry that is located on the aircraft's external 
hard points includes R-60 close-range missiles, S-24 and S-24B 
(240 mm) unguided rockets, UB-32A or UB-16 57 mm rocket pods, 
B-8M1 S-8 80 mm rocket pods, up to 22 50 kg or 100 kg bombs, up 
to nine 250 kg bombs, or up to eight 500 kg bombs. RBK-250 
disposable bomb canisters, BetAB-250 and BetAB-500 
concrete-piercing munitions with a jet booster, BRAB-200DS, 
BRAB-220, BRAB-500, and BRAB-1000 armor- piercing bombs, and 
napalm tanks can be hung under the aircraft. Small caliber bombs 
are placed on MBD3-U6-68 multifixture storage racks. 
  The MiG-27K aircraft that was demonstrated at the exhibition 
was equipped with a Kh-31 antiradiation guided missile. 
  The MiG-27K fighter-bomber was equipped with a head-up 
display (HUD), the SAU 23BI, a Korall-N close navigation radio 
system, an AO-31 radio altimeter, and on board electronic 
warfare systems. The navigation system ensures a dual standard 
error of less than 1.0%. 
  The aircraft was in series production from 1977-1982 at 
Irkutsk Aircraft Plant (200 aircraft were produced). 
  A Klen laser rangefinder-target designator was installed in 
the nose section in a simpler modification of the MiG-27M 
("32-29") aircraft that was produced in 1978-1983 at Irkutsk 
Aircraft Plant (150 aircraft were manufactured). The aircraft 
were equipped with a KN- 23S navigation system, a Klistron 
system, an improved AO-31 radio altimeter, a television display 
in the cockpit which, however, can operate only from a 
television guidance system of a guided missile or bomb because 
there is no onboard television camera on the aircraft. There is 
also no HUD. In contrast to MiG-27's of previous modifications, 
the aerodynamics of the ventral cannon mount have been improved 
(the fairing of the breech portion of the gun has been increased 
and powder gas deflector plates have been installed). 
  The aspiration to approximate the combat capabilities of 
previously built MiG-27's to the characteristics of the MiG-27M 
resulted in the development of the MiG-27D aircraft ("32-27")--a 
previously produced MiG-27 that has been reequipped with the 
MiG-27M aircraft's avionics. Reequipping the fighter-bombers 
began in 1982 at the aircraft plant at Ulan-Ude and was 
completed in 1985. A total of approximately 500 MiG-27's were 
modernized. 
  The MiG-27D could be equipped with a canister with an aerial 
camera and utilized as a frontal aviation reconnaissance 
aircraft. 
  The MiG-27ML ("32-29L") that was manufactured in 1982 and 
has 
simplified avionics is the export variant of the MiG-27M 
aircraft. The aircraft was developed based on India's order and 
is being produced by the NAL firm at the aircraft plant at Nasik 
under the designation "Bahadur" ("Valiant"). A small series of 
MiG-27ML's and parts kits for the first shipment of aircraft 
assembled in India was manufactured at the plant in Irkutsk. 
Assembly of the first Indian MiG-27 manufactured from parts 
supplied by the USSR was completed on 11 January 1986 and 
manufacture of Indian "Bahadur" fighter-bombers began in 1988. 
They propose manufacturing a total of 165 aircraft of this type 
in India, which should compose the foundation of Indian Air 
Force strike aviation in the 1990's. They propose reequipping 
the "Bahadur" aircraft with Western avionics developed for the 
Indian variant of the Jaguar aircraft that includes the Smith 
Industries Darim navigation/attack system and also the Thomson 
Agave radar. 
  The Syrian Air Force utilized MiG-23BN fighter-bombers to 
inflict massive strikes against targets in the depth of the 
Israeli combat formations (several aircraft were lost from enemy 
ZSU [self- propelled antiaircraft artillery mounts] fire as a 
result of not totally successful planning and organization of 
air operations) during the course of combat operations between 
Israel and Syria in the Bekaa River Valley during the summer of 
1982. 
  MiG-23BN's, piloted by Cuban pilots, were successfully 
employed in Angola for strikes against ground-based targets, 
specifically, combat positions and lines of communication of RSA 
and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
troops, however, two aircraft of this type were destroyed by 
enemy air defense ground-based weapons fire (specifically, by 
Chinese NI-5A PZRK [portable antiaircraft missile 
system]--copies of the Soviet Strela-2 portable antiaircraft 
missile system) in 1987. 
  During the course of the Iran-Iraq War, Iraqi MiG-27BN's 
were 
used to conduct strikes against oil terminals and naval surface 
targets in the Persian Gulf and also against ground-based 
targets in the theater of military operations. The aircraft's 
combat capabilities were increased even more after equipping it 
with a nonretractable aerial refueling probe similar to the one 
utilized on the Mirage F- 1EQ and also with a pod with the 
French-made ATLIS optical- electronic tracking and target 
designation system which permitted an increase in the launch 
range of the Kh-29L guided missile from 8-10 km (with a 
Soviet-made laser illumination system) to 14 km. 
  In contrast to the MiG-23BN, the MiG-27 has hardly been 
utilized in combat operations, with the exception of Afghanistan 
(based on the experience of this war, many MiG-27's and MiG-23's 
were equipped with additional IR flare pods that are located on 
the fuselage and, based upon their shape, resemble stall fences).

<H5>  The MiG-21 Fighter Aircraft </H5>
  At the present time, the MiG-21 aircraft is the most 
widespread fighter aircraft in the world. It was series produced 
for approximately 28 years (from 1959 through 1986) at the 
Znamya truda MMZ, Gorkiy Aircraft Plant and also at the aircraft 
plant at Tbilisi. MiG-21 aircraft of various modifications were 
supplied to the air forces of the USSR, Algeria, Angola, 
Bangladesh, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, 
Germany, Egypt, Ethiopia, Finland, Guinea, Hungary, India, Iraq, 
Yugoslavia, Laos, Libya, Madagascar, Mongolia, Nigeria, the 
DPRK, Vietnam, Poland, Romania, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Uganda, 
and Zambia. The MiG-21 was built in India and China based on a 
Soviet license (the Chinese variant of the MiG-21F-13 aircraft, 
the J-7, is in series production up to the present time). 
  The following primary modifications of the MiG-21 fighter 
aircraft have been developed: the MiG-21F (first flight--1958) 
and the MiG- 21F-13 (1959)--frontal aviation fighters designed 
for use during the day; the MiG-21PF (1962), the MiG-21FL 
(1964), the MiG-21PFM (1964), the MiG-21PFS (1964), the MiG-21S 
(1965), the MiG-21SM (1968), the MiG-21M (1968), the MiG-21MF 
(1970), the MiG-21MT (1971), the MiG- 21SMT (1971), and the 
MiG-21bis (1972)--frontal aviation all-weather fighters equipped 
with a radar gunsight; the MiG-21R (1965)--a frontal aviation 
reconnaissance aircraft; the MiG-21U (1960), the MiG-21US 
(1966), and the MiG-21UM (1971)--a trainer fighter aircraft; the 
MiG-21PD ("23-31", 1966)--an experimental aircraft with a 
combined power plant (an R-11F2-300 sustainer turbojet engine 
with afterburner and two RD-36-35 lift turbojet engines; and, 
the MiG-21I Analog (1968)--an experimental aircraft developed 
within the framework of the Tu-144 SPS program. A total of more 
than 20 modifications of the MiG-21 aircraft were developed.

  MiG-21 aircraft of various modifications have participated 
in 
combat operations in Vietnam, where they demonstrated greater 
effectiveness as an air superiority fighter than the American 
McDonnell-Douglas F- 4 Phantom II aircraft. MiG-21 fighter 
aircraft were utilized in the Arab-Israeli wars in 1967, 1973 
and 1982, in the 1971 Indo-Pakistani conflict, in the Iran-Iraq 
War, and also in combat operations in Angola and Afghanistan. 
  The MiG-21SM aircraft displayed at the exhibition is being 
used as a flying test stand within the MiG-21 aircraft avionics 
and weaponry modernization program. Two R-27 medium-range 
missiles, the employment of which from the MiG-21 fighter is 
possible after reequipping the aircraft with the Kopye small 
multifunction onboard radar specially developed for modernizing 
an aircraft of this type, were installed on the external hard 
points of the demonstrated fighter. 
  The radar is capable of: 
  --detecting and tracking airborne targets in the automatic 
mode, including targets flying at low altitude over land or 
water, without revealing the fighter's location; 
  --supporting an attack based upon target designation and 
destruction of targets with missiles with antiradiation or IR 
seeker heads and also using a cannon; 
  --carrying out a high-speed vertical search and automatic 
lock-on of visually observed targets at close range using 
improved guided missiles that have heightened maneuvering 
characteristics; and, 
  --forming a scale map with high resolution, enlargement of 
scale, and "freezing" the image. 
  The possibility to connect to analog and digital equipment 
onboard the aircraft and also ease of control of operation has 
been provided for. 
  Kopye radar equipment includes an antenna, a transmitter, an 
analog processor, a power source, a signal processor, a pulse 
generator, a synchronizer, an onboard digital computer, a unit 
to link to the computer, an information transformation unit, a 
CRT display installed in the cockpit, a built-in monitoring 
panel, a control panel, a HUD to which radar information is also 
sent, and a liquid cooling system. 
  The radar has seven primary operating modes: 
  --detection and automatic tracking of airborne targets in 
free space and in the background of the earth (sea) with the 
transmission of target designation to missiles with TGS 
[television seekers] or RGS [radar seekers], and also aiming 
using unguided weapons (the cannon, unguided rockets, or bombs); 
  --tracking of several targets and attacking them using 
missiles in the surveillance mode; 
  --the rapid search--close-range mode; 
  --cartography of the earth's surface using an active beam 
(low resolution); 
  --cartography of the earth's surface using synthetic 
aperture 
(high resolution); 
  --enlargement of scale of the selected sector of the map; 
and, 
  --measurement of the coordinates of the target selected on 
the ground (sea). 
  Based upon its primary specifications, the Kopye radar 
corresponds to or somewhat outstrips the American Westinghouse 
AN/APG-68 radar that has been installed on the General Dynamics 
F-16C aircraft. 
  A new automated command and control system, an RD-33 
turbojet 
bypass engine with afterburner that is used on the MiG-29 
aircraft, and also a Kh-35 antiship guided missile that can be 
hung on the ventral pylon are other improvements that can be 
employed on the modernized MiG-21 aircraft. 
  Based on the assessments of OKB representatives, the 
modernized variant of the MiG-21 fighter, based upon its combat 
capabilities, approximates fourth generation fighters with 
significantly lower cost. 
  At the end of 1991 it was reported that the Government of 
India had decided to conduct large-scale work on modernization 
of MiG-21 aircraft--the primary fighters of the Indian Air Force 
(production of the MiG-21bis aircraft based upon a Soviet 
license was completed in India in 1988, approximately 200 
aircraft were built)--as a result of delay in the work to 
develop the LCA [Light Combat Aircraft] multimission fighter 
being developed by India jointly with Dassault-Breguet. 
  It is proposed to install new avionics and a new engine and 
change the shape of the wing to provide the best maneuvering 
characteristics on the modernized Indian MiG-21 aircraft. The 
RD-33 turbojet bypass engine with afterburner (8,300 kgs) or the 
RB-199 Turbo-Union (7,680 kgs) is regarded as a new engine. 
  Furthermore, the Government of India plans to provide 
modernized MiG-21 fighters for export. Based on Indian demands, 
an improved variant of the MiG-21 fighter has been developed at 
the OKB imeni A.I. Mikoyan. In September 1991 the technical 
documentation for the new variant of the aircraft was submitted 
to the Indian side for review. In accordance with the draft, 
changes were made to the fighter's avionics and weapons system, 
as a result of which the aircraft's combat potential increased 
by a factor of 2.5 to three. The cost of modernization of the 
MiG-21 aircraft should total approximately 30% of the 
cost of 
the fighter. It is proposed to perform work on the program at 
Indian and Russian enterprises. In the words of OKB imeni A.I. 
Mikoyan General Designer R.O. Belyakov, they intend to resolve 
the problem of spare parts for Indian Air Force MiG-21 fighters 
by supplying India with parts of aircraft of this type that have 
been removed from the Russian Air Force inventory. 
  Work on a similar program in Pakistan, India's primary 
potential enemy, where it is planned, jointly with the PRC, to 
reequip J-7P fighters (the Chinese variant of the MiG-21F-13 
aircraft that was supplied to Pakistan) with an RD-33 or RB-199 
turbojet bypass engine with afterburner is one of the reasons 
that prompted the Indian side to decide to modernize the MiG-21 
fighters. 
  Preliminary negotiations were reported on the joint 
development of a wide range of avionics for modernization of 
variants of MiG-21 aircraft (specifically, the development of 
new cockpit equipment and a weapons control system were 
proposed) between the OKB imeni A.I. Mikoyan and the British 
firm GEC Avionics during the course of the exhibition's work. 
  GEC Avionics is already cooperating with China in the sphere 
of developing improved avionics for the MiG-21 (J-7) fighter. 
  Continuation of the "MOSAEROSHOW-92" RUSSIAN AEROSPACE 
EXHIBITION survey will be in No 41.

  The participation of the ANTK [Aircraft Scientific Technical 
Combine] imeni O.K. Antonov in "Mosaeroshow-92" was sufficiently 
modest. The An-124 Ruslan and the An-225 Mriya "heavyweights" 
were absent and, of the light transport aircraft, only the 
An-72P patrol aircraft, the An-26P forest fire fighting 
aircraft, and also the An-32 and An-32B were displayed on the 
ramp and in different locations. 
  The An-72P patrol service aircraft is distinguished from the 
primary variant by the installation of weaponry and a 
surveillance system. Weaponry includes two unguided rocket pods 
on underwing pylons and a GSh-24 twin-barrel gun located in the 
right fairing in front of the main landing gear. Four bombs, 
which can be dropped in flight when the ramp is retracted under 
the fuselage, are suspended in the cargo compartment over the 
cargo ramp. The OTV day surveillance television system, which 
provides a resolution of 10 meters at a distance of 3,000 
meters, is located in a fairing in front of the left main 
landing gear and is covered by a hood in the nonoperating state. 
The aircraft demonstrated at "Mosaeroshow-92" had speckled 
camouflage paint.

  The An-26P forest fire-fighting aircraft was developed based 
on the series-produced An-26 transport aircraft through the 
installation of two external discharge devices (tanks) with a 
control system. The minor design differences of the An-26P and 
the An-26 permit the fire-fighting An-26P to be rapidly 
reconfigured into the initial transport variant. The An-26P's 
flight and ground operations are completely identical with the 
transport aircraft and ensure the utilization of a wide network 
of dirt airfields. The An-26P aircraft can be utilized to 
accomplish the following missions: 
  --visual air surveillance of the fire condition of large 
tracts of forest; 
  --visual assessment of fire-stricken area in order to 
develop 
fire-fighting strategy; 
  --on-target drop-zone deliveries of firemen and equipment 
into fire localization zones; 
  --extinguishing fire using fire-extinguishing liquid carried 
in the external tanks; and, 
  --extinguishing fire using the artificial initiation of 
precipitation method from clouds located in the fire area by 
firing silver iodide charges at the clouds.

  A model of the An-70T future transport aircraft designed to 
replace the An-12 aircraft in the CIS countries' air forces and 
civil aviation was demonstrated on the ramp of the ANTK 
[Aircraft Scientific Technical Combine] imeni O.K. Antonov. 
  The An-70T is manufactured based on a normal aerodynamic 
design with a high wing. Composite materials were widely used in 
the design of the airframe. The power plant consists of four 
D-27 turbofan engines (4 x 13,880 horsepower) developed at the 
Progress NPO [Scientific Production Association] (Zaporozhye, 
Ukraine), which have coaxial propellers (engine flight tests 
were conducted in 1992 at the LII [Flying-Research Institute] 
imeni M.M. Gromov on an Il-76 flying laboratory aircraft; 
furthermore, more than 1,000 hours of test stand testing have 
been conducted). A digital fly-by-wire system [FBW] and cockpit 
multifunction color screen displays have been utilized in the 
An-70T aircraft. 
  A payload with a maximum weight of up to 30,000 kg can be 
accommodated in the larger diameter fuselage equipped with an 
aft ramp (up to 5,000 kg of cargo can be transported on the 
ramp). The cargo compartment is pressurized and 
loading-unloading operations have been mechanized to the maximum 
extent possible. The landing gear and powerful high-lift devices 
provide the capability to operate the aircraft from both 
concrete and dirt runways. Landing gear clearance can be 
adjusted, which ensures that the height of the truck bed and the 
height of the cargo hatch floor conform while conducting 
loading-unloading operations. 
  The An-70T aircraft's first flight is planned for the 
beginning of 1993. The aircraft is designed for 45,000 flying 
hours (20,000 sorties during a 25-year period) and six to seven 
man-hours of ground maintenance should be expended per hour of 
flying time. 
  It is planned to carry out series production of the aircraft 
at aircraft plants at Tashkent and Samara. The An-70T aircraft 
development program is being financed by the Russian and 
Ukrainian Governments. 
  The An-70T aircraft surpasses the An-12 aircraft by a factor 
of 1.5 in payload and by a factor of 1.4 in cruising speed; 
based on its specifications it most closely corresponds to the 
Euroflag FLA [Future Large Aircraft] European Consortium 
military transport aircraft being developed jointly by Belgium, 
Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey. Like 
the Ukrainian aircraft, the FLA can be equipped with turbofan 
engines (although other power plant variants are also being 
examined), however, it has a somewhat lower take-off weight and 
payload weight. Furthermore, the rate of development of the 
European aircraft significantly lags behind the rate of 
development of the An-70T aircraft, which opens favorable 
prospects for sale of the An-70T aircraft on the international 
market to replace the obsolete An-8, An-12, Lockheed's C-130 
Hercules, and Transall's C-160 transport aircraft.

  The ANTK imeni O.K. Antonov developed the design of the 
An-170 transport aircraft--a variant of the An-70 with a 
lengthened fuselage and increased wingspan that is designed to 
replace the Il-76 aircraft. However, preference was assigned to 
the Il-106 aircraft in a design competition. 
<H5>  OKB imeni S.V. Ilyushin Aircraft </H5>
<H5>  The Il-106 Transport Aircraft </H5>
  A model of the new Il-106 transport aircraft was 
demonstrated 
at "Mosaeroshow-92." The aircraft, a normal design with four 
TRDD [turbojet bypass engines] with a super-high-bypass ratio 
and vertical tail surfaces, belongs to the same class of 
aircraft as the American C-17 military transport aircraft and is 
obviously designed to accomplish the same missions.

<H5>  2. Helicopters </H5>
<H5>  The Mi-24 Army Combat Transport Helicopter </H5>
  Demonstrated at "Mosaeroshow-92," the OKB imeni M.L. Mil 
Mi-24 helicopter is well known throughout the world as the 
former USSR's first fire support helicopter. Its development 
began in 1967 in parallel with preparation for series 
production, which saved quite a lot of time. A prototype model 
of the new helicopter took off for the first time in 1969 and 
series-production helicopters began to arrive at units in 1971. 
Later it was supplied to customers from 22 countries. By 1992, 
series production of the Mi-24 had ceased. The Mi-24 was 
produced in the following variants:

  The Mi-24 is capable of destroying enemy tanks, storming 
enemy fire positions and defensive positions, escorting 
transport-assault helicopters and conducting aerial combat, 
adjusting artillery fire, dropping small assault subunits and 
reconnaissance teams into the enemy rear area, conducting 
radiation and chemical reconnaissance, and evacuating wounded 
personnel from the battlefield. This was one of the world's most 
effective helicopters until the end of the 1970's. In 1975 and 
1978, seven world records, including the absolute speed 
record--367 kph in 1978, which was held for approximately 10 
years--were established in the variant of the Mi-24 that 
received the designation A-10. The helicopter was tested under 
fire in many wars and military conflicts (Afghanistan, Iran, 
Iraq, Angola, Mozambique, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Ethiopia), 
where it proved itself to be a reliable ground troops fire 
support system. It was also utilized for operations against 
airborne targets: The Iran-Iraq War episode when an F-4 Phantom 
fighter aircraft was shot down by gun fire from an Mi-24 serves 
as the most graphic example. 
  The fundamental difference between the Mi-24 and Western 
helicopters is the compartment for a squad of assault troops 
(eight men). Initially, the crew of the Mi-24 included two men: 
the pilot and the weapons operator. Then the flight engineer was 
introduced into the crew, whose work location is located in the 
assault compartment. Up to now, the Mi-24's engines, developed 
at the OKB imeni V.Ya. Klimov under the leadership of General 
Designer S.P. Izotov, are at the level of the world's best 
models based on specific and weight specifications. The Mi-24's 
special equipment includes an optical-electronic (infrared and 
television for low levels of illumination) surveillance-gunsight 
system in the right nose ventral fairing and a radio command 
missile guidance system in the left nose ventral fairing, a PKB 
gunsight (on the Mi-24V), a HUD [head-up display], a radar 
illumination warning receiver, an IR jamming system, an 
identification friend-or-foe system [IFF], a gun camera, ASO-2 
pods with 132 decoys, and a UHF communications system. The 
flight-navigation system includes an autopilot, a radio 
altimeter, an instrument flying system, a DISS [Doppler slip and 
drift sensor], an ARK [aircraft radio compass], and mechanical 
indicators with a moving terrain map. 
  At first, the Mi-24 was armed with four Falanga subsonic 
PTUR's [antitank guided missiles] with manual control (later 
with a semiautomatic control system): two antitank guided 
missiles, each located on the wing tip pylon launch rails. 
Beginning with the Mi-24V they were replaced with Shturm-V 
9K113/9M114 supersonic antitank missiles, the number of which on 
the wing tip and underwing pylons reaches 12. R-60 close-range 
guided missiles, UB-32-57 or UB-20-57 unguided rocket pods with 
S-5 (32 x 57 mm or 20 x 57 mm), S-8 (80 mm) or 240 mm unguided 
rockets, a UPK-23-250 standard gun pod with a GSh-23L gun 
(23-mm, a basic load of 250 rounds, dimensions 340 x 450 x 3,000 
mm), pods with machine guns or grenade launchers, up to 1,500 kg 
of chemical or conventional bombs, canisters with mines, etc., 
can be installed on the four underwing pylons instead of 
antitank guided missiles. The helicopter can land and reload its 
weapons with ammunition located in the compartment. 
  The gun has also undergone changes. The first Mi-24's had a 
single-barrel machine gun, then a four-barrel 12.7 mm machine 
gun with a rotating barrel unit was installed in a USPU-24 
ventral, standard machine gun mount with electronic remote 
control.

  Since 1980, initially the Mi-24P gun variant was armed with 
a 
GSh-30-2 30 mm twin-barrel gun with a basic load of 250 rounds 
in the right fuselage fairing and then with a 23 mm gun on a 
mobile mount. 
<H5>  The Ka-50 Fire Support Helicopter </H5>
  The OKB imeni N.I. Kamov Ka-50 new generation army combat 
helicopter, whose primary missions on the battlefield are troop 
fire support, covering armored vehicle combat operations, and 
opposing enemy army aviation, was demonstrated in flight for the 
first time at "Mosaeroshow-92." This is the first employment in 
world practice of a single-seat helicopter to accomplish this 
type of mission. The helicopter's first flight occurred on 17 
June 1982 (test pilot Nikolay Bezdetnov). A large amount of 
modeling was conducted in the process of its development, 
hundreds of flights were made in a flying laboratory, 
experimental and prototype models of the Ka-50 accumulated 
several thousand flying hours, firings were conducted from the 
gun, and unguided rockets and antitank missiles were launched. 
The conclusion of the customer's test pilots--the helicopter is 
accessible for line unit pilots with medium skills. 
  Development was conducted on a nontraditional competitive 
basis for Russian helicopter manufacturing and, in the process, 
the task was assigned to develop a domestically produced 
helicopter that did not lag behind the specifications of the 
American AH-64 army combat helicopter. 
  Four possible designs were examined during the validation of 
the Ka-50's appearance: single-rotor with a tail rotor, 
longitudinal, dihedral, or coaxial, and the latter was chosen 
which, besides higher combat survivability, ensures the 
helicopter's heightened efficiency in a hover and at low flight 
speeds and while gaining altitude and an increased static 
ceiling with equal engine output, simplified flying (due to the 
lack of cross links in the control channels as a result of the 
helicopter's aerodynamic symmetry, and improved maneuverability 
(for example, a flat turn capability)). Furthermore, a coaxial 
design helicopter has a reduced visual and radar cross section 
due to its smaller geometric dimensions. 
  The decision to assign one crew member to accomplish combat 
missions also determined the Ka-50's appearance. That decision 
was made taking into consideration the experience of the combat 
employment of the Mi-24 helicopter, the operation of which, in 
the opinion of General Designer S.V. Mikheyev, demonstrated that 
the pilot's tasks (piloting and navigating the helicopter with 
the goal of undetected access to the target search and attack 
area at extremely low altitudes) largely do not intersect with 
the operator's tasks (target search and attack using antitank 
missiles). Honored Combat Pilot of the USSR, Hero of the Soviet 
Union, Russian Ground Forces Army Aviation Commander in Chief 
Lieutenant General V. Pavlov thinks that an independent safe 
search for targets by a combat helicopter in conditions of 
strong PVO [air defense] or a search for targets that are using 
modern camouflage systems is a very difficult task. Therefore, 
in any case, this requires the transmission of a preliminary 
target designation to the attacking helicopter which is 
necessary not only to ensure that it is not detected but also to 
organize helicopter group operations. The latter circumstance 
(operations by a well-organized group) is an important element 
for the success of an attack. Everything listed, especially high 
maneuverability, the need for which was confirmed in 
Afghanistan, and the simplicity of piloting a coaxial design 
helicopter, played a decisive role in the development of 
precisely a single-seat combat helicopter. 
  The Ka-50 helicopter was designed taking into consideration 
the improvement of serviceability. It has built-in equipment 
operability monitoring systems, and has been provided with 
convenient access to equipment without utilizing ladders. 
Servicing the weapons systems, electronic systems, refueling, 
and loading are carried out from the ground. Power plant 
servicing from the cowlings-ladders and servicing of the main 
rotors is carried out from the upper surface of the fuselage. 
System design provides for combat utilization of the Ka-50 with 
prolonged separation (more than two weeks) from main bases. 
  A distinguishing feature of the Ka-50 is the completely 
armored cockpit that protects the pilot from up to 20-mm rifle 
and cannon weapons. The cockpit is equipped with a K-37 seat 
that was designed for it. The K-37 ensures the rescue of the 
pilot during ejection at any altitude. The rotor blades are 
jettisoned before ejection. This is the first employment in the 
world of an ejection system in a helicopter that has been 
proposed for series production. 
  It has a tricycle landing gear with the nose gear retracted 
in flight which permits reduction of the helicopter's 
aerodynamic resistance and its radar cross section. Flight with 
the landing gear extended is authorized in the entire range of 
speeds while flying at extremely low altitudes in the event an 
emergency landing has to be carried out. 
  Modified engines have been installed on the Ka-50, which 
have 
proven themselves in operation on the Mi-24 and are equipped 
with dust-protection and exhaust screen devices. 
  A single gunsight-flying-navigation system which permits one 
crew member to both fly and conduct fire from all types of 
weapons has been developed for the Ka-50 for the first time in 
the practice of domestic helicopter manufacturing. The optical 
gunsight system (OPS) installed on the helicopter ensures target 
search and automatic guidance of antitank missiles to the 
target. A helmet-mounted target designation system has been 
employed that relieves the pilot of the task of controlling the 
optical gunsight system. The pilot is freed from the need to 
maintain a certain trajectory of movement and the helicopter can 
complete altitude and course changes and change flight speed 
after launch in the process of guiding the antitank missile. It 
has a HUD on which flight and also gunsight information for 
employment of the gun and unguided rockets is depicted. 
Information on the status of onboard systems is transmitted to 
the pilot and information is also utilized that is received via 
radio channels from reconnaissance helicopters. The helicopter 
REP [electronic countermeasures] system shows no lag behind the 
Apache helicopter's similar system in its functional indicators. 
  The Ka-50 has four weapons hard points under its wing on 
which up to 16 supersonic antitank guided missiles or up to 80 
80-mm unguided rockets (in four 20-tube pods) can be suspended. 
Employment of other types of removable weapons is also possible. 
Antitank guided missiles support the attack of targets outside 
the zones of destruction of enemy antiaircraft missile systems 
and a high probability of hitting small targets in the entire 
spectrum of missile launch ranges. The antitank missile's launch 
range is 8-10 km, it has the capability of piercing 900 mm of 
armor with dynamic protection, and it has a laser guidance 
system. 
  An important feature of the Ka-50 is the employment of the 
2A42 tank gun (it is also utilized on the BMP-2) with a high 
armor-piercing capability and the capability for recoilless 
operation in dust, sand, and dirt. The 30-mm gun has selective 
feed and a variable rate of fire and the basic load of up to 500 
rounds is located in two ammo boxes in the central section of 
the helicopter. The unusual solution was realized thanks to the 
compromise that was found--rigid attachment of the gun's 
rotating gun mount to the starboard side of the fuselage in such 
a way that a turn of the gun in the vertical plane is carried 
out by a servo in approximately the same range of angles as the 
AH-64 helicopter, and in the horizontal plane--by turning the 
entire helicopter (a flat turn). The tracking servo holds the 
gun on the target. Installation of the gun turret near the 
center of gravity ensures very high accuracy of fire. At low 
altitudes, the pilot uses the manual operating mode, at great 
distances--the precise automatic firing mode, the aiming of 
which is no different than aiming to launch an antitank guided 
missile. 
  The Ka-50 helicopter program has a high priority in the 
plans 
of the Russian Armed Forces and, therefore, work on the 
organization of Ka-50 series production continues despite a 
significant reduction in defense expenditures. The helicopter's 
entry into Russia's army aviation units is anticipated by the 
end of the year. The VNTK [Helicopter Scientific Technical 
Combine] imeni N.I. Kamov is seeking paths into the foreign 
market: in S. Mikheyev's words, they propose participating in 
the competition for a new combat helicopter that the British 
Army plans to announce by the end of 1992. The winning firm will 
obtain an order for the manufacture of 130 helicopters whose 
primary mission will be to combat tanks. A variant of the 
helicopter with Western equipment will be offered to Great 
Britain. In spring 1992 the OKB concluded an agreement with the 
American company Group Vector that envisions equipping the Ka-50 
helicopter with Western systems and weaponry, which will make 
the Ka-50 more competitive in the foreign aircraft market, and 
organizing marketing of the helicopter. 
<H5>  The Mi-28 Fire Support Helicopter </H5>
  The Mi-28 combat helicopter was demonstrated for the first 
time at the 1989 Paris Air Show. Design of the Mi-28 began in 
1980 and the first prototype helicopter left the ground on 10 
November 1982. The helicopter was built based upon the single 
rotor design traditional for the OKB, selection of which was 
based on the results of the analysis of a large number of 
designs of the aircraft, including twin-rotor designs. In 
contrast to the Ka-50, this is a two-seat aircraft. OKB imeni 
M.L. Mil experts say that the mission of flying at extremely low 
altitudes (5-15 meters) over the earth's surface with complex 
relief and the simultaneous search for remote targets cannot be 
effectively accomplished by one man even if he is assisted by 
totally modern optics and electronics based upon current 
concepts. All the more so in that flying and destroying targets 
does not exhaust the crew's tasks--it also needs to avoid coming 
under fire from enemy air defense systems. Other helicopter 
manufacturing firms also assign a preference to the advantages 
of a two-man crew: all the world's helicopters in combat ranks 
are two-seaters. 
  The number of mechanical hinged joints, lubrication points, 
and joints with nuts requiring calibrated tightening were 
drastically reduced on the Mi-28 to increase serviceability. 
Attached ladders are not required when servicing the helicopter 
in the overwhelming majority of cases and ease of access to 
assemblies has been achieved through rapid and total exposure of 
power plant cowlings and equipment compartment hatches. The 
Mi-28 has built-in monitoring systems. The average total 
labor-intensiveness of maintenance has been reduced by a factor 
of three in contrast to the Mi-24 helicopter and by a factor of 
three to nine on individual assemblies and systems. The Mi-28 
can be transported in the cargo compartments of the An-22 and 
Il-76 aircraft with the main rotor blades and wings removed. 
  The Mi-28 helicopter was manufactured based on a 
single-rotor 
design with a tail rotor located on the right in flight (in 
contrast to the Mi-24 on which the tail rotor has been installed 
on the left in flight). Special attention was devoted to 
increasing the helicopter's combat survivability. During the 
selection of its configuration, the task was assigned to ensure 
mutual screening of assemblies and protection of more critical 
members by less critical members (for example, the engines have 
been separated by a distance that is adequate for placement of 
the main gearbox). The selected materials and dimensions of the 
members ensure the absence of catastrophic failures when damaged 
for a time that is adequate to carry out the mission with a 
return to base. For example, the fiberglass from which the main 
rotor and tail rotor blades are manufactured has high residual 
strength when damaged. The dimensions and spar sections were 
selected with the calculation that weapons of the most probable 
caliber will not cause an unacceptable loss of their durability 
when hit. The crew cockpit is protected with titanium armor with 
external ceramic plates and has armored glass with flat 
low-reflective panels. 
  The Mi-28 has a five-bladed main rotor and a titanium hub 
with elastomeric bearings. The blades have fiberglass D-shaped 
spars that are manufactured using the spiral fiber winding 
method, have Kevlar plastic sections with a Nomex-type filler, 
and anti-abrasive titanium pads have been installed on the 
leading edges of the blades. The blades have high load-bearing 
profiles and streamlined tips. The diameter of the main rotor 
was selected approximately the same as the Mi-24's so that the 
improved Mi-28 helicopter blade could subsequently be 
transferred to the Mi-24. The main rotor shaft is inclined ahead 
by 5 and the rotation of the main rotor is 242 rpm. 
  The crew is located in cockpits arranged in step fashion: 
the 
navigator-operator's work station is located in the forward 
cockpit and the pilot is located in the raised rear cockpit. The 
pilot's mission is to fly the helicopter and employ the unguided 
weapons and the navigator-operator's mission is search, 
detection, identification, and destruction of small targets at 
maximum range using precision-guided weapons and the gun and 
also helicopter navigation. 
  The X-shaped tail rotor consists of two two-bladed rotors 
with fiberglass blades. The rotors are installed at angles of 
35/145 on one shaft on an elastomeric bearing (one 
three-bladed tail rotor was initially used on the first two 
prototype helicopters). The tricycle landing gear with tail 
support is nonretractable. It has single-wheel landing gears, 
the sizes of the main tires are 720 x 320 mm, the operating 
pressure is 0.54 MPa, and the dimensions of the self-orientating 
tail wheel is 480 x 200. 
  The power plant consists of two TVZ-117 GTD [gas turbine 
engines] that have been installed in nacelles along the sides of 
the upper section of the fuselage over the engines, and the 
engine nozzles are canted downward. The engines have a 
modernized electronic adjustment system. The air intakes have 
dust protection devices and an anti-icing system with bleed air 
from the engines. The transmission can operate without lubricant 
for 20-30 minutes. 
  The AI-9V VSU [auxiliary power system] is utilized to start 
the engines and drive the electrical supply system and the 
hydraulic and pneumatic systems on the ground, which permits 
these systems to be maintained in operable condition for the 
required time without starting the main engines. The capacity of 
the internal fuel tanks is approximately 1,900 liters. Four 
external tanks can be suspended on the underwing pylons. 
  The helicopter has a hydromechanical control system. Control 
of the stabilizer is linked with control of the main rotor 
collector pitch. Only the pilot has flight control elements. 
Systems control has been integrated to the maximum extent 
possible. The control elements that are used in flight--the 
"pitch-gas" lever and the control stick--are located on the left 
control panel and the control elements that are required only 
for preparation for flight are located on the right control 
panels. Depiction of secondary information on systems operation 
to the crew has been practically excluded. The pilot's cockpit 
has a HUD and a CRT [cathode ray tube] display in the center of 
the instrument panel to depict optical-electronic system data. 
  OKB experts think that crew ejection from a helicopter in 
emergency situations has too many shortcomings and preferred a 
crew rescue system without leaving the helicopter. 
Energy-absorbing seats with a gravitation system to create the 
required preparatory position and an undercarriage with an 
increased shock-absorber stroke ensure survival for the crew 
during emergency landings when the helicopter hits the ground at 
high (up to 12 meters per second) vertical speeds and at high 
speeds when the ground is hit sidelong or head-on. Design steps 
have been taken that prevent members of the crew from colliding 
with control elements and interior elements and also prevent 
systems and assemblies that are outside the cockpit from ending 
up inside the cockpit. Sensors and mechanisms automatically turn 
on the rescue system if the crew does not manage to turn it on 
in the manual mode for some reason. The probability of a 
post-accident explosion or fire has been reduced. Parachutes 
have been provided for a possible departure from the aircraft 
from high altitude and emergency jettisoning of the cockpit 
doors and inflation of pneumatic cells located under the 
threshold of the doors (to exclude a collision with the 
undercarriage) occur prior to a jump. 
  There are two hydraulic systems with an operating pressure 
of 
15.2 MPa and a 200 volt alternating current electrical supply 
system with two generators. 
  The surveillance-gunsight system--the navigator-operator's 
primary system to guide antitank missiles and fire from the 
gun--has been installed on a gyrostabilized platform and has a 
great deal of mobility (+/-110 along the azimuth). In the 
day variant, the system has two optical channels with wide and 
narrow fields of view and an optical-television channel with a 
narrow field of view. A laser rangefinder-target designator has 
also been provided that is used to determine its current range 
to the target, to calculate adjustments in the automatic mode 
while firing from the gun and while launching unguided rockets, 
and also for selection of the optimal trajectory for an antitank 
missile at the moment of launch. These systems are also utilized 
to control a missile while it is being guided to the target. An 
IR system and a TV system for low levels of illumination can be 
installed for operations at night. It is also possible for the 
crew to use night vision glasses. 
  Firing is conducted using a HUD or a helmet-mounted gunsight 
that controls the mobile gun within visual range without using 
magnifying optics. The Vitebsk helicopter electronic 
countermeasures system (analogous to the Apache helicopter's 
AN/ALQ-136) has been installed. It has IR radiation suppression 
devices and automated decoy dispensers. 
  The weaponry of the prototype helicopters includes a turret 
mount with a 2A42 modified tank gun (30-mm; 900 round per minute 
rate of fire against airborne targets and 300 rounds per minute 
against groundbased targets; basic load 300 rounds), which has 
the same mobility as the gunsight (+/110 along the azimuth 
and +13 -40 in elevation) and synchronously follows it. 
  Moscow's Dzerzhinets Assembly Plant is developing a fixed 
mobile (the previous range of mobility has been maintained) gun 
specially for the Mi-28. A single-barrel 30-mm gun with 
selective feed is being utilized. The rate of fire is 300 and 
600 rounds per minute and the basic load is 250 rounds. The 
weight of the NPPU [fixed mobile gun mount] with a basic load 
and the gun is 620 kg, the weight of the control apparatus is 45 
kg, and the dimensions of the NPPU are 1,730 x 1,100 x 750 mm. 
  There are two hard points under the outer wing panel, each 
of 
which is designed for a load of up to 480 kg. Up to 16 Shturm 
antitank guided missiles with a radio command guidance system 
and two pods with 20 57-mm or 80-mm unguided rockets are 
suspended under the wing. Firing from the gun and launching 
antitank missiles are carried out only by the operator from the 
forward cockpit and unguided rockets can be launched from both 
cockpits.

<H5>  OKB imeni M.L. Mil Future Aircraft </H5>
  Information on future military or dual-purpose helicopters 
that have been developed at this collective was presented at the 
MMZ [Moscow Machine Building Plant] imeni M.L. Mil Pavilion. 
  A drawing of a future helicopter--the Mi-40 infantry 
fighting 
aircraft developed based on the Mi-28 helicopter's main rotor 
design and power plant--was displayed. The Mi-40 helicopter is 
designed to equip airmobile rapid deployment forces units and is 
equipped with a built-in twin-barrel 23-mm gun which is mounted 
in a new type of remotely controlled nose turret with an 
increased field of fire. Furthermore, it is proposed arming the 
helicopter with future antitank missiles and unguided rockets. 
  The helicopter's avionics ensure its effective combat 
employment in complex weather conditions and at night. An 
assault team of eight-10 men is located in the fuselage and can 
conduct fire against groundbased targets using organic weapons.

  A convertible aircraft with a tilting wing, on which two 
large diameter propellers have been installed (design similar to 
the design of the American V-22 Osprey aircraft) and which 
accommodates five people, is designed to carry out a wide circle 
of military and civilian missions (transport, patrol, rescue 
operations, reconnaissance, etc.). 
  The Mi-54 helicopter is designed to replace the Mi-2 and 
Mi-4 
multimission helicopters which are widely operated in our 
country and abroad. 
  The Mi-46T heavy helicopter is called upon to replace the 
Mi-6 transport helicopter and the Mi-10K helicopter-crane. 
<H5>  3. Trainer Aircraft </H5>
  A model of the Yak-UTS trainer aircraft was displayed at the 
OKB imeni A.S. Yakovlev Pavilion. Besides the aircraft, the 
training system includes simulators and automated training 
systems using personal computers. The Yak-UTS is designed to 
replace the Czech-made L-39 Albatros trainer aircraft of the CIS 
countries' air forces and was selected based upon a competition 
in which, besides the OKB imeni A.S. Yakovlev, the OKB's imeni 
A.I. Mikoyan, P.O. Sukhoy, and V.M. Myasishchev participated. 
The new aircraft's first flight could occur in 1994-1995 and the 
beginning of series production in 1995-2000. 
  The aircraft is manufactured according to a normal 
aerodynamic design with a wing that has developed wing 
extensions and winglets. The aerodynamics and high 
thrust-to-weight ratio (0.6-0.7) provide the capability to fly 
in modes close to those of fourth generation fighters 
(specifically, flight is possible with an attack angle of up to 
32). 
  The twin-seat cockpit with a single canopy provides a good 
field of view for both the pilot and the instructor. Two 
multifunction CRT displays with screen sizes of 130 x 130 mm 
will be installed on the instrument panels, and it also has a 
HUD. 
  It is proposed equipping the aircraft with two AI-25TLM 
turbojet bypass engines (Progress NPO [Scientific Production 
Association), Zaporozhye) that have a service life of 1,000 
hours. In the future it is proposed employing better engines 
developed at the OKB imeni V.Ya. Klimov (in contrast to the 
AI-25TLM turbojet bypass engines with afterburner, they propose 
increasing the thrust by 15%, economy by 4%, 
service life must 
total 4,000 hours and must increase to 6,000 hours in the 
future). A 700-liter capacity conformal external fuel tank can 
be installed under the fuselage. 
  The aircraft's control system is hydromechanical and they 
envision reconfiguring it to imitate flight in various types of 
aircraft. 
  The UTS is equipped with an inertial navigation system, a 
radio navigation system, a radio altimeter, a video recorder, 
and K-36 ejection seats. A laser gun-simulator and also laser 
radiation receivers (smoke generators that imitate destruction 
in aerial combat should be switched on automatically when the 
"enemy" aircraft's laser beam hits them) will be installed in 
the aircraft to train in conducting aerial combat. 
  Airframe service life should total 10,000 hours and could 
increase to 15,000 hours in the future, which corresponds to UTS 
operation for 30 years. 
  Besides the basic trainer variant, a carrier-based UTS is 
being developed that is equipped with a folding wing, reinforced 
landing gear, and arresting hook. 
  It is proposed developing a four-seat UTS with two two-seat 
cockpits to train bomber aviation pilots. It is proposed 
utilizing the carrier-based variant of the four-seater aircraft 
as a transport-passenger aircraft for rapid delivery of people 
and light cargo to aircraft-carrying ships (maximum cruising 
speed--650 kph, operating range--2,000 km). 
  A single-seat strike variant of the aircraft with augmented 
weaponry and onboard radar is being developed for export 
deliveries.

  The T-501 UTS that was displayed at the exhibition is a 
future trainer aircraft developed by the OKB imeni A.I. Mikoyan. 
Construction of the first prototype T-501 UTS equipped with a 
TVD [turbojet engine] began in April 1992. Work is being 
financed by the firm RosAeroProgress (RAP), which concluded a 
contract worth R38 million with the OKB imeni A.I. Mikoyan at 
the beginning of 1992. Requirements for the UTS were coordinated 
with the CIS Air Force. It is proposed building two prototype 
aircraft for flight tests and also one aircraft for static 
tests. The first flight of the new UTS is planned for March 
1993, and the flight of the second prototype aircraft is planned 
for June 1993. Aircraft model wind tunnel tests were 
accomplished at the ADT [wind tunnel] at TsAGI [Central 
Aero-Hydrodynamics Institute]. 
  It is proposed equipping the T-501 aircraft with the TVD-10V 
engine (1 x 1,025 horsepower), the UTS's wingspan should total 
11 m, length --9.66 m, wing area--16.5 m[.sup]2[/], normal 
take-off weight--2,670 kg, maximum speed--560 kph, maximum rate 
of climb--21 mps, ferry range--1,800 km and, flight range at low 
altitude--1,000 km. 
  It is possible that an order will be received to build 
approximately 800 UTS's of this type. 
  The Czech L-59 Aero UBS that was demonstrated on the ramp 
and 
in flight was the only foreign combat aircraft presented at 
"Mosaeroshow-92." The aircraft is the further development of the 
L-39 Albatros UBS widely used in the air forces of the CIS 
countries (more than 1,600 aircraft were delivered) and 14 other 
states. 
  The aircraft is equipped with a ZVL/Lotarev DV-2 turbojet 
bypass engine with afterburner and a Sapfir APU [automatic 
safety device]. Avionics include an RSBN [radio navigation 
system], an SRO-2M identification friend or foe system, an RV-5 
radio altimeter, a HUD, and cockpit screen displays on CRT's. 
The two-man crew is located in VS-2 ejection seats in a cockpit 
under a single canopy that folds back and supports leaving the 
aircraft on the ramp. Aircraft weaponry with a total weight of 
1,053 kg is located on five external hard points and can include 
a gun, two air-to-air guided missiles, bombs, and unguided 
rockets. Work is being conducted on a single-seat strike variant 
of the L-59 aircraft.

  The new OKB imeni P.O. Sukhoy-designed Su-29T aircraft 
displayed at the exhibition is a two-seat variant of the 
well-known Su-26MKh sports-acrobatics aircraft that was also 
displayed. The Su-29 is designed for flight training, mastering 
the art of aerobatics by military and civilian pilots and air 
school cadets, for trainers and performances at aircraft sport 
competitions. The aircraft has high speed run and rate-of-climb 
specifications, good handling combined with low G-loads on the 
control elements and a 360 field of view from the cockpit. 
The high durability of the design (authorized G-load is 23) 
combined with a high seat angle of incline (35) permits the 
pilot to repeatedly utilize a G-load of +12/-10 while 
flying, which gives the aircraft an advantage during flight in a 
restricted flying zone. 
  The aircraft is manufactured with wide employment of 
composite materials (more than 70% of aircraft design 
weight). 
The aircraft wing (twin-spar, one-piece) is totally manufactured 
from composite materials based upon carbon plastics and 
plexiglass and the wing skin panels have a honeycomb filler. The 
central portion of the fuselage has a truss tubular welded frame 
made of high-tensile strength stainless steel and removable skin 
panels made from composite materials. The tail fairing and tail 
section of the fuselage are a semi-monocoque design made from 
composite materials. It has a tricycle landing gear with tail 
bumper. The primary wheels are installed on springs made from a 
titanium alloy and are equipped with differential disc brakes 
with a hydraulic drive. 
  The Su-29 is equipped with an M-14P air-cooled nine-cylinder 
radial piston engine with an output of 360 horsepower. It has a 
pneumatic engine ignition system. The capacity of the main fuel 
tank is 70 liters. It has two tanks built into the wing with a 
total capacity of 220 liters to ferry the aircraft. 
  The Su-29T single-seat variant is designed to train 
pilot-sportsmen and for their participation in acrobatic 
competitions and is distinguished from the two-seat variant by 
its reduced length and weight, boosted engine and, as a result, 
improved speed and maneuvering properties. There is a 140 liter 
external tank to ferry the aircraft, but two tanks built into 
the wing with a total capacity of 220 liters can be used instead. 
  It is proposed delivering 24 Su-29 two-seat aircraft abroad 
in 1992.

<H5>  4. Aircraft of Special Designs </H5>
  The work of R.L. Bartina and R.Ye. Alekseyev that laid the 
foundations of wing-in-ground effect vehicles in the USSR 
created a solid foundation for the further development of 
aircraft using the screen effect which, according to some 
assessments, could become the primary type of long-range 
transport in the next century. 
  Nizhniy Novgorod's Central KB [Design Bureau] for Ships and 
Hovercraft NPO is undertaking efforts to expand the sphere of 
application of the Orlenok wing-in-ground effect vehicle, which 
was developed in the 1970's, as a transport vehicle for the 
Navy. Five vehicles have been built thus far and three of them 
are in operation. In 1992 the use of the Orlenok in the 
Mriya-Orlenok aviation-maritime search and rescue system was 
proposed. 
  The An-225 Mriya was developed in 1985-1988 and its first 
sortie occurred on 21 December 1988. By the beginning of 1992 it 
had completed approximately 400 flights with a total duration of 
approximately 600 hours, including 36 flights with the Buran 
reusable spacecraft. The proposed system consists of an 
aircraft-platform based upon the Mriya and a rescue 
wing-in-ground effect vehicle based upon the Orlenok. They 
assume that the Mriya-Orlenok system will be based at civilian 
or military coastal airfields. When a distress signal is 
received, the aircraft-platform will fly to the accident area 
and conduct a search if necessary. As soon as the object of the 
search has been found, the wing-in-ground effect vehicle will 
start engines and separate from the aircraft-platform. The 
wing-in-ground effect vehicle's developed wing permits it to 
carry out a gliding descent and a landing on water. In the event 
that the accident object is located outside the range of the 
aircraft-platform, the wing-in-ground effect vehicle is 
separated at the maximum possible distance from the basing 
airfield (at the "drop point") and carries out the remaining 
portion of the trip independently. 
  The system platform will be somewhat different from the 
basic 
Mriya aircraft. It requires installation of special 
communications, search and onboard auxiliary equipment, and also 
development of strong hard points and an attachment and 
separation system for the Orlenok wing-in-ground effect vehicle. 
  Five Mriya-Orlenok systems, dispersed along the water area 
of 
the World Ocean and united in a single international rescue 
system, cover practically all zones of heavy navigation, 
fishing, and the maritime petroleum industry. The development 
and introduction into operation of this system will take four to 
five years and will be cheaper than designing another new 
aviation-maritime rescue system because the prototypes of both 
components of this system are already flying. With an operating 
period of 20 years, the system will already pay for itself in 
three years and will begin to yield a profit. Organization of an 
international rescue service is required to implement this 
program for rescuing people at sea.

  Negotiations between the Nizhniy Novgorod TsKB [Central 
Design Bureau] and the firm Aerocon (United States) on the issue 
of joint development of the new wing-in-ground effect vehicle 
occurred in January-March 1992. In 1989 Aerocon obtained a 
$546,000 contract from the U.S. Department of Defense Advanced 
Research Programs Agency (DARPA) to study the wing-in-ground 
effect vehicle concept. The firm anticipates that another $1 
million will be allocated to continue the research. Although 
DARPA has reported that it does not plan to expand this program 
(transferring it to the stage of development and production), it 
is known that it enjoys the support of the U.S. Central Command 
staff, which has compiled official TTT [tactical-technical 
specifications] for a vehicle of this type, and the support of 
the U.S. Transportation Command staff. The advantages of 
wing-in-ground effect vehicles were demonstrated during the 
assessment of possible scenarios of potential wars. For example, 
two wing-in-ground effect vehicles can transport an American 
infantry brigade, equipped with guided weapons which can 
neutralize three to five enemy armored divisions, to a crisis 
zone in one trip.

  According to Aerocon spokesmen, approximately $15 billion 
would be required for a demonstration program that envisions the 
construction of 12 wing-in-ground effect vehicles over a 15-year 
period. In the event resources are allocated, the first 
wing-in-ground effect vehicle flight could occur in five years. 
The cost of one wing-in-ground effect vehicle is $500-700 
million. 
  Efficiency and the low cost of a ticket will be the primary 
feature of the civilian variant. A wing-in-ground effect vehicle 
can be employed for military purposes to transport either 32 
helicopters, 20 tanks, four hydrofoils, or 2,000 servicemen and 
1,350 tonnes of cargo.

  Irkutsk State University (IGU) laboratory complex exhibits 
that were presented at "Mosaeroshow-92" aroused interest. IGU 
demonstrated a model of a wing-in-ground effect vehicle-flying 
wing with a hydrofoil undercarriage (ShVP) that is being studied 
under the "Skat" program. The combination of a wing-in-ground 
effect vehicle with a hydrofoil undercarriage permits us to 
support basing without airfields with a corresponding increase 
of the effectiveness of transport operations when existing 
wing-in-ground effect vehicles are adapted for take-off and 
landing from a single type of take-off and landing surface--from 
the water or from an airfield with a hard covering. 
  It is proposed using the aircraft that was demonstrated as 
the primary system to carry out transport missions in the areas 
of Siberia and the North. The economic effect of its 
introduction is potentially very great because this transport 
does not require the creation of a network of causeways or 
prepared airfields and can be operated around the clock on any 
ground. The hydrofoil undercarriage permits it to move 
practically at any speed, beginning from the hover mode with 
zero forward speed to a transition speed to wing-in-ground 
effect flight with a high aerodynamic quality at speeds of 
700-900 kph. Low pressure on the ground in a static hydrofoil 
(0.06-0.07 atm [atmospheres]) does not have a substantial impact 
on the ground which, in combination with the employment of 
hydrogen engines as a power plant, makes this type of transport 
ecologically clean and harmless. 
  The undercarriage has a cupola design with a stiff, 
sectioned, spring-loaded enclosure: there are stiff flaps on the 
lower surface of the flying wing that tilt with the creation of 
a multichamber cupola under the wing in which a static air 
pillow is created by bleeding air from the gas turbine engines. 
The static air pillow is required for take-off and landing. The 
flaps are retracted into the wing contours in cruising flight 
and are included in the design-power plant design to increase 
the load ratio for a commercial payload. 
  The wing-in-ground effect vehicle-flying wing's high 
aerodynamic quality ensures its high transport effectiveness, a 
commercial payload may reach 50% of take-off weight and 
the 
cost of one tonne-kilometer will be 1.5-2 times lower than for 
transport aircraft of the beginning of the 1990's. The 
wing-in-ground effect vehicle is being studied in two main 
variants: 
  --for medium and long-range (2,000-20,000 km) cargo 
transport 
movements with high transport effectiveness in the form of a 
delta wing with a thick S-shaped profile that provides an 
aerodynamic quality of from 25 to 35 (in various 
configurations); and, 
  --for short-range (1,500-2,000 km) cargo transport movements 
with moderate transport effectiveness in the form of a flying 
wing-flat platform.

  It is assumed that wing-in-ground effect vehicles with a 
broad spectrum of take-off weights (on succeeding scales) can be 
developed. 
  The latest vehicle in this series (with a take-off weight of 
1,000 tonnes) must have a wing area of 1,800 m[.sup]2[/], a 
cruising speed of 720-900 kph, a maximum practical range with a 
full payload of 7,000 km, with a carried payload of 250 
tonnes--10,000 km, and an aerodynamic quality of 30 with a 
relative altitude over the screen of 0.1 and aerodynamic quality 
of 25 with a relative altitude of 0.2. 
  So far, the IGU laboratory complexes jointly with Irkutsk 
Aviation Production Association have created a manned stand. By 
the end of 1992 they planned to build the first experimental 
manned model of a wing-in-ground effect vehicle-flying wing and 
designs of possible series-produced vehicles are being 
developed. With adequate amounts of financing, research of 
experimental manned models and construction of prototype models 
will be completed by 1996 with subsequent test operation of 
prototype vehicles in 1996-2000. The results of the laboratory's 
work were demonstrated at international exhibitions in the 
United States (Seattle) and Germany (Hanover) and also at VDNKh 
[Exhibition of the National Achievements of the Economy] at the 
"Ecologically Clean Transport" Exhibition. In May 1993, Irkutsk 
University proposes to organize the First International 
Conference on Wing-in-Ground Effect Vehicles under the 
chairmanship of M.P. Simonov. 
  At "Mosaeroshow-92," Moscow's EKIP production firm displayed 
information on a family of wide-fuselage highly economical 
aircraft that do not require airfields, with a cargo capacity 
from two to 200 tonnes, capable of carrying out both free as 
well as wing-in-ground effect flight and have low fuel 
consumption (from 10 to 14 grams per passenger-kilometer). The 
aircraft will be able to take off from any category of airfield, 
including water surfaces. The vehicles have a design that is 
close to the "flying wing" design with a load-bearing fuselage 
in the shape of a thick, low-aspect-ratio wing and small 
winglets. According to calculations, the vehicle's patented 
shape permits reduction of the weight of the design by reducing 
the level of the aerodynamic loads and their equal distribution 
along the surface of the vehicle, reduction of inductive 
resistance and an increase of the aerodynamic quality (up to 
17-25 in free flight and 22-30 during flight near the ground) 
due to a reduction of the required lift coefficient (as a result 
of the increase of the aerodynamically lifting area), and an 
increase of the volumes of cargo-passenger compartments by eight 
to 10 times, in contrast to passenger transport aircraft 
comparable in cargo capacity. A patented device for controlling 
boundary currents that provides attached flow and a hydrofoil 
undercarriage have also been employed on EKIP's vehicle.

  At the exhibition, the OKB imeni P.O. Sukhoy disseminated 
information on the development of the S-90-200 highly 
comfortable passenger amphibious wing-in-ground effect vehicle 
which has been ongoing for several years now. Development is 
based on a preliminary agreement with the Singapore firm Aero 
Marine. This twindeck liner is designed to transport passengers 
and cargo on medium and long routes that run primarily over a 
water surface with poorly equipped stopping points. The 
configuration of the upper deck envisions two salons: first 
class for 39 passengers and tourist class for 54 passengers. 
Eight cabins are located on the lower deck. The capability to 
embark and disembark passengers on shore in locations that are 
not equipped with piers is the outstanding feature of this 
vehicle. The wing-in-ground effect vehicle must ensure flight 
safety over the sea in areas with a large number of islands and 
intense navigation.

  The OKB imeni G.M. Beriyev A-40 multimission amphibious 
aircraft demonstrated at "Mosaeroshow-92" in flight and on the 
ramp was developed for long-range antisubmarine warfare 
operations, with the capability to develop various civilian 
modifications for broad employment in island and coastal areas 
that do not have an adequate number of airfields and also on 
water areas of the world ocean. The A-40 is being offered in 
passenger, cargo-passenger, search and rescue (the Be-42), and 
other variants. It can carry out the replacement of crews of 
surface ships and conduct patrol operations in a 200-mile 
economic zone. The Be-200 shortened variant is being developed 
based on it. 
  The A-40 aircraft was demonstrated publicly for the first 
time outside the USSR at the Paris Air Show in July 1991. By 
that time the aircraft had established 14 world records, 
including raising a 10-tonne cargo payload to an altitude of 
13,281 m and cargoes of 1, 2, and 5 tonnes to an altitude of 
13,367 m. The A-40 aircraft's maximum flight weight reached 
69,300 kg while establishing the records. 
  The A-40 is a cantilever monoplane with a high sweptwing and 
T-shaped tail fairing. More than 60 developments were 
acknowledged by inventors during the development of the 
Albatros. The high aspect ratio wing has a sweep of 
approximately 27 along the leading edge. Mechanization of 
the wing trailing edge consists of two mobile double-slotted 
flaps that occupy a large portion of the span and leading edge 
slats are located along the entire sweep of the leading edge. 
Nonretractable floats that serve to increase the aircraft's 
stability on the water have been installed on short pylons on 
the wing tips. There is an aft water rudder. It has a 
single-step hull with a high aspect ratio. 
  A variable-rise bottom has been developed for the first time 
in world practice, which permitted significant improvement of 
the aircraft's stability and controllability while moving 
through the water and also a reduction of G-loads during 
take-off and landing. Honeycomb bonded structures and 
nonmetallic materials have been widely employed in the aircraft 
airframe. A 6.10 meter-long weapons compartment has been located 
in the aft section of the hull. It has a tricycle landing gear 
with a nose gear and the main gears retract into large fairings 
located behind the wing. The base of the undercarriage is 14.835 
m (between the centers of the wheels), and the track is 4.980 m 
(along the central points of the twinned wheels). 
  The aircraft is equipped with two Perm Aviadvigatel 
[Aircraft 
Engine] NPO [Scientific Production Association] D-30 KVP 
turbojet bypass engines, which are installed over the landing 
gear fairings behind the wing, preventing water from getting 
into the air intakes during take-off and landing. Additional 
protection from water is provided through the installation of 
strakes along the sides of the hull in the nose section and in 
front of the planing step. Two booster engines, located under 
the main turbojet bypass engines in the main gear fairings, 
serve to improve take-off characteristics from a water surface. 
The aircraft has an aerial refueling system with a fuel 
reception probe located above the nose section of the hull. 
  There must be a radar with antenna in the nose fairing on 
the 
initial ASW [antisubmarine warfare] variant. Equipment to render 
antihypothermia, surgical, antishock, and other types of medical 
assistance are envisioned on the Be-42 search and rescue 
variant. Onboard systems to lift rescued people out of the water 
include two LPS-6 six-seat semirigid motor boats, mechanized 
ladders, and special equipment. The maritime rescue craft is 
equipped with radar and navigation equipment permitting it to 
conduct rescue work in conditions of limited visibility, even in 
fog, and also at night. When extinguishing fires, the Albatros 
is capable of collecting water onboard while gliding, which 
permits it to increase the frequency of sorties to the site of a 
fire. 
  The maximum combat payload of 6,500 kg includes up to three 
Orlan antiship torpedoes or up to four to six Korshun, Yastreb, 
or Orel antiship guided missiles (all in the bomb bay).

  A full-size mockup of the Yamal light amphibious aircraft 
developed by the Aviaspetstrans Consortium jointly with EMZ 
imeni V.M Myasishchev was demonstrated at "Mosaeroshow-92." The 
amphibious aircraft is designed for operation in Russia's 
northern areas, Siberia, and the Far East. The preliminary 
design has been completed and production of a prototype aircraft 
has begun. The first flying model of the Yamal should take off 
at the end of 1994. It is planned to produce 20 aircraft by 
1995. The assumption is that hundreds of these aircraft will be 
required. 
  More than 1 million pieces of various equipment are 
concentrated in the areas of the Russian North, but only 
2-3% 
of the fleet has been adapted for operation under extreme 
conditions. In contrast to the summer period, the productivity 
of machinery and mechanisms is reduced by several times during 
the winter period under conditions of low temperatures. The 
design of the airframe, placement of the engines and propellers, 
and configuration of the equipment have been subordinated to the 
main goal--servicing the aircraft "from within" the fuselage, 
which is extremely important in the North. 
  Aviaspetstrans Consortium was formed around the Yamal 
project 
in 1990 to renew and develop the air service infrastructure on 
local routes in areas of the North, Siberia, and the Far East. 
Aviaspetstrans' task includes supplying economic organizations 
and the native population with modern aviation services with the 
maximum possible level of ecological cleanliness. The consortium 
consists of EMZ imeni V.M. Myasishchev, several NII's 
[scientific research institutes], Moscow Regional Commercial 
Bank, and several state organizations. 
  Yamal is differentiated by its original twin-engine 
turboshaft power plant, consisting of two TVD-1500's and located 
behind the wing with a drive to the six-bladed pusher propeller 
installed on the T-shaped tail fairing. That location of the air 
propeller and also the air intakes located on top of the 
fuselage will protect the engines and air propeller from jets of 
water coming out of the amphibious aircraft's "chines" and 
underwing floats and from pieces of ice breaking off. 
Negotiations are occurring with Canadair on possible 
cooperation: They propose series production in Russia of the 
Canadair CL-415 twin-engine amphibious aircraft and joint work 
on Yamal. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada has offered four PT6 engines 
free of charge for installation on prototype Yamal aircraft.

<H5>  5. Remotely Piloted Vehicles </H5>
  The development of remotely piloted vehicles [RPV] capable 
of 
accomplishing a wide circle of missions on behalf of the various 
branches of the armed forces and the national economy is one of 
the most promising directions of development of military and 
civilian aircraft. 
  The Kulon NII and the Russian Air Force demonstrated the 
Malakhit terrain aerial surveillance system designed for 
surveillance in the optical and IR range at any time of day 
using the Shmel-1 RPV. 
  Typical missions for the system are: ecological monitoring 
of 
the environment; patrolling terrain; monitoring the radiation 
situation around AES's [nuclear power plants]; surveillance of 
the state of oil and gas pipelines, heat and energy lines; 
assessment of the state of ice on rivers, and the consequences 
of natural disasters (earthquakes, fires, floods, etc.); 
monitoring the accomplishment of agricultural work; assessment 
of the moisture content of the soil, the temperature of fields, 
weed levels, and the state and quality of sowing; and 
surveillance of herds and the migration of animals. 
  The system consists of an integrated launch and control unit 
located on a BMD-1 combat assault vehicle tracked chassis, the 
RPV, and a mobile maintenance facility. 
  The launch and control unit carries out automatic prelaunch 
monitoring, launch, and command and control of the RPV, and 
reception and depiction of terrain images on a television screen 
in real time. A picture of the terrain that is being observed 
from onboard the RPV and also the track of the aircraft and its 
current coordinates are depicted on a video control device 
installed on the control and launch unit. 
  A high degree of automation of the processes of monitoring 
ground and onboard devices and also flight control and the 
availability of built-in simulator systems permit reduction of 
the requirements for operator qualification and reduce operator 
training time. 
  The system ensures command and control and reception of 
information from the RPV when located at a distance of 60 km 
from the launch and control unit. Simultaneous command and 
control of two RPV's is permitted. A television camera installed 
on the RPV has an adjustable remotely controlled angle 
(3-30), the IR sensor field of view totals 3.4 of the 
flight altitude, and the resolution of the IR sensor is 3 mrads. 
  The Shmel-1 RPV is a reusable aircraft manufactured 
according 
to a normal aerodynamic design with a pusher propeller in a ring 
shroud. An autopilot ensures stability of flight, which consists 
of a computer, compass, vertical gyroscope, angular velocity 
sensors and electric drives to control the ailerons and 
elevators and also the throttle butterfly of the sustainer 
engine.

  A model of the future Kolibri RPV developed at the OKB imeni 
A.S. Yakovlev was demonstrated in the spring of 1992 at the 
African Air Show in Johannesburg (Republic of South Africa). The 
aircraft, manufactured based on a normal aerodynamic design, has 
a wing that smoothly joins the fuselage, which promotes 
reduction of the radar signature, and a T-shaped tail to which a 
pusher propeller has been attached. 
  The RPV is equipped with a 75 horsepower piston engine, can 
carry a payload that consists of various sensors with a total 
weight of 70 kg, and is capable of operating at a distance of up 
to 180 km from the launch and control unit. The combat radius 
can be increased to 700 km when a second relay RPV is used.

  Raduga MKB offered information on a series of small 
agricultural and military RPV's. In particular, an autogyro was 
demonstrated that utilized the Shmel RPV fuselage in its design. 
Another small aircraft-type flying apparatus that is designed 
for use in agriculture is launched and controlled from a small 
launch and control unit that is mounted on a GAZ-66 motor 
vehicle chassis. 
  Eniks NITs demonstrated the Ye85 aerial target, designed to 
imitate cruise missile and glide bomb type targets, at 
"Mosaeroshow-92". The target has been manufactured according to 
a normal aerodynamic design with a straight wing, has light 
plastic construction, is launched from a helicopter's external 
hard point and carries out a landing on a parachute. Programmed 
or radio-command target control is used. Employment of a light 
original design pulsing VRD [jet engine] that is protected by a 
copyright is a distinguishing feature and the thrust of the 
PuVRD is approximately 40 kg.
