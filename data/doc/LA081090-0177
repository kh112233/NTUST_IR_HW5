COURT URGED TO MAKE BAND PAY $5 MILLION 
A British rock band and its record company should pay up to $5 million in 
damages to a young fan who allegedly was spurred to enter a suicide pact by 
subliminal words hidden in the group's music, an attorney argued today. 
Vivian Lynch, representing the family of James Vance, also charged in her 
closing arguments that a multitrack original of the song "Better by You, Better 
Than Me," by the heavy metal band Judas Priest was altered before it was 
presented to the court as evidence. 
"If this trial does nothing else than prevent the use of subliminals in mass 
communications, then this trial will be a success," Lynch said. 
She urged Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead, who is hearing the case 
without a jury, to award damages of $4 million to $5 million to Vance's family 
to repay nearly $500,000 in medical bills and to compensate for pain and 
suffering. 
Closing arguments in the four-week-old trial were to continue into the 
afternoon. 
Whitehead will then decide whether the alleged subliminal messages exist and, 
if so, whether they promoted the youths to shoot themselves. 
Members of the heavy metal group contend that no covert words exist in the 1978 
"Stained Class" album. 
The families of Vance and Raymond Belknap that backward and subliminal messages 
on the album contain blasphemy and promote suicide. 
Belknap, 18, died of a single blast from a shotgun held in his mouth two days 
before Christmas, 1985. Vance, then 20, blew away the lower portion of his 
face. He fathered a child and lived three years before his death on 
Thanksgiving Day, 1988.
