NEWSWIRE: HIGH JUMPER ADMITS TO USING STEROIDS BRIEFLY 
Jimmy Howard, a two-time Olympian and the former U.S. record-holder in the high 
jump, has admitted using anabolic steroids briefly in 1979, but said he gained 
too much weight and has not used them since. 
The 6-foot-5, 175-pound Howard, in an interview published Wednesday in the 
Toronto Sun, was responding to allegations made Tuesday by Canadian high jumper 
Milt Ottey at the the Canadian government's commission of inquiry into drug use 
by athletes. 
Howard, 29, who placed 10th at the Seoul Games said, "I'd be lying if I said I 
never tried them but I gained so much weight (from the drugs) I couldn't jump." 
Ottey had testified that a jumper at the 1984 Harry Jerome Games in Vancouver, 
British Columbia, tried not to finish in third place after it was announced 
that the winners and third-place finishers would be tested for drugs. Howard 
finished third but left after the competition before he could be tested.
