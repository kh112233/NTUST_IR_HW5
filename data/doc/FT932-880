FT  26 JUN 93 / Assault by right disrupts talks in S Africa
SOUTH AFRICA'S right-wing whites, some of whom yesterday drove an armoured
car through the plate glass front of the country's constitutional conference
centre, have long had the arms, the skills and the organisation to disrupt a
peaceful transition to democracy in the new South Africa.
Yesterday saw the first worrying signs that they might also have the
determination to do so.
About 1,000 heavily armed police took little action against the members of
the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement), who
stormed the World Trade Centre outside Johannesburg, beat up black women
delegates and journalists, and defiled the walls of the negotiation chamber
with slogans demanding an Afrikaner homeland and accusing the ruling
National Party of treason.
Terrified delegates fled the centre, leaving about 100 men and women, - all
toting weapons - occupying the chamber where South Africa's first
multi-racial constitution is being written. About 3,000 more waited outside.
Many protestors cited the fact that, on the eve of the assault,
constitutional negotiators had voted by an overwhelming majority to deny the
demand of the right-wing Conservative Party (which represents ultra-radical
whites) for Afrikaner 'self-determination' in a separate white state.
Nonetheless, within hours, the 26-party negotiating forum was back in
business, with the chamber walls repainted to cover right-wing slogans, and
even the Conservative Party (which helped lead the attack) seated at its
accustomed place. Once again, the centre held; but it had another nasty
shock.
