NORTHWEST'S BATTLE OVER TREES AND JOBS 
The timber base in our country is vanishing quickly on public and private 
lands. While the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management have been 
busy liquidating forests on federal lands, a recent study by the Oregon State 
University School of Forestry indicates that the private forest owners in that 
state will essentially cut their last mature tree in a few years. 
There simply is not enough resource left to satisfy the insatiable appetite for 
raw logs for Asian markets. In attempting to satisfy this demand, we have been 
decimating our national forests and exporting the mill jobs that go along with 
the unprocessed logs. 
In the Northwest, about 25% of the resource is exported as whole logs, 35% as 
raw materials and 40% is domestically processed. If exports are stopped the 
Northwest can stop cutting on all public lands without shrinking the domestic 
timber supply. The banning of exports is the one area of common ground between 
the timber industry and environmentalists. The overwhelming support in logging 
communities for the advisory referendum banning log exports reflects how 
closely related loggers' job security is connected with the banning of log 
exports. 
And those concerned with forest values such as watershed, climatic effects, 
wildlife habitat, fish spawning areas, scenic beauty and recreation would be 
pleased with the lowering of the cut. The time has come for us to put a halt to 
the plundering of our dwindling timber resource for the advantage of other 
nations. To save what is left of our native forests we must ban log exports 
now.
