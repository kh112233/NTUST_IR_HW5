FT  26 MAY 92 / Taiwan boosts copyrights
TAIWAN'S parliament has passed revisions to its copyright law, strengthening
protection of foreign patents and copyrights in a bid to avert US trade
sanctions, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The new law, passed last week, gives explicit legal protection to a wide
range of products, including Chinese translations of English-language
publications, computer software, and films and music recorded on laser
discs.
It imposes heavier penalties for copyright piracy. Violators now face
seven-year prison terms and fines of up to Dollars 18,000 (Pounds 10,000),
and victims of infringements can seek up to Dollars 40,000 in damages.
Intellectual property talks between Taipei and Washington broke down last
month and the US trade representative placed Taiwan on a 'priority watch
list' of countries failing to prevent piracy of US copyrights.
It could face trade retaliation, including tariffs of up to 100 per cent on
some of its shipments, unless it satisfies Washington within six months that
it has made progress towards stopping piracy.
A US industry group has estimated intellectual property theft costs American
companies Dollars 370m a year in Taiwan.
The revisions will also help Taiwan's application to join the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, legislators said.
