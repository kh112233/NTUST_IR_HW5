CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA; 
HANDMADE; 
PORTRAITURE IN PAPER 
SHE WAS PAID the ultimate compliment: A few years ago two of her works were 
stolen from a Westwood gallery along with a Miro, a Dali and a Lichtenstein. 
Beverly Bigwood is an artiste du papier. 
In other words, when the rest of us graduated elementary school and left behind 
construction-paper days, she continued to play with the colored paper, 
ultimately developing it into an art form. Her whimsical folk-art portraits 
have adorned the walls of such widely known L.A. restaurants as Spago, Nucleus 
Nuance, 7th Street Bistro and El Cholo and have appeared in such prominent 
stores as Giorgio and Fred Segal. 
Following a telephone interview with a customer, during which a discussion of 
mood and color takes place, Bigwood works from a photograph, cutting, ripping 
and otherwise molding the client's personality into a finished collage. Her 
pieces are particularly popular as gifts for weddings, for parents of newborns 
and for husbands, wives and other significant others. The lively, animated 
portraits measure 16x20 inches and sell for $90.
