FT  24 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Consultant's
Critique
If so many management textbooks stress how important customers are, why do
so few companies take any notice?
British Airways' previous regime mirrored businesses across the country -
customers were all that stopped the real work getting done. Turning this
around has been an impressive achievement for Charles Weiser.
The software has only been a small part of this success. While the system is
good, it still has a number of rough edges. It does not use the full power
of graphical user interface
provided by IBM's OS/2. The workstations all run a terminal emulator that
mimics an old-fashioned screen. Faxes and letters are displayed on a second
screen.
In many ways, it appears clumsy in use. If operators wishes to pan the
second screen or zoom in on a particular area, they have to look at the
first and type on the keyboard. While it is not an issue at present, worries
over repetitive strain injury should make BA look at the ergonomic issues
soon.
The system integrates reasonably well with external BA database systems and
the customer liaison staff have more access to BA systems than many
managers. The current methods might be helped by more sophisticated software
but at least the current system works.
I liked the idea that staff could measure their own performance using
Caress.
They can compare their workload with that of their peers and look at how
well they are achieving agreed targets. Likewise, managers can see which
members of their team do less well and then develop tailored training
packages for them.
As ever, the human management story overshadows the technology. The system
succeeds because of Weiser's skills rather than because of any technical
wizardry.
The study shows that success is produced by managers, not just technology.
