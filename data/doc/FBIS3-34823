  [Text] Cairo, Feb 14 (AFP) -- A bomb planted by suspected 
militants seriously wounded four people in a shopping centre in 
a town north of here on Monday, police said. 
  The bomb, which went off outside a shop and wounded passers 
by in the town of Tanta, was similar to those seized during a 
police raid here two weeks ago in which seven members of the 
outlawed Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [Islamic Group] were killed. 
  Two of the group's gunmen also fired on a bus carrying 
Romanian and Egyptian engineers in the southern city of Asyut on 
Monday, shattering windows but caused no injuries. 
  The Jama'ah said it carried out the shooting attack as part 
of its "campaign against foreign investors and tourists" and to 
avenge seven members killed in a February 1 police raid in 
Cairo, the group said in a statement to AFP. 
  The gunmen opened fire as the bus drove through Asyut, 380 
kilometers (230 miles) south of Cairo, on its way to a cement 
factory, police said. The engineers hit the floor when the 
shooting started and escaped injury. 
  The Jama'ah has warned foreigners to leave Egypt as part of 
a 
violent campaign against President Husni Mubarak's government 
which has killed almost 300 people. 
  The group said the shooting was the fifth attack it has 
carried out to "avenge the seven martyrs of al-Zawiyah 
al-Hamra'," a poor Cairo neighborhood. Jama'ah has accused the 
police of gunning down the seven militants in cold blood.
