FT  24 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Airport X-rays put spotlight on
crime
X-RAY machines used at airports for screening luggage are sophisticated but
the video images which they produce are often so unclear that operators have
difficulty interpreting them.
A new imaging system developed by a team at Nottingham Polytechnic, called
SecureScan, uses computer image-processing techniques to enhance the X-ray
picture. This enables the operator to see into black areas which might
conceal a weapon and into light areas where drugs or explosives, including
Semtex, might be hidden.
Because the Pounds 12,000 system bolts on to existing airport X-ray
equipment, rather than replacing it, it is relatively cheap and quick to
install. The Nottingham team developed the system on behalf of the UK
Customs and Excise authorities. Nottingham Polytechnic: UK, 0602 486491.
