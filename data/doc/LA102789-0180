TOURIST FOUND DEAD IN KENYA WAS MURDERED, COURT DECIDES 
A British tourist whose charred bones were found in a game park was murdered, a 
court ruled today, vindicating her father's yearlong battle against state 
investigators who claimed that wild animals had killed her. 
The death of Julie Ward remains unsolved, however, with no one arrested and the 
judge's saying he saw no need for further investigation. Ward's father has 
charged that there was an official cover-up to protect Kenya's lucrative 
tourism industry. 
Ward's partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were found Sept. 13, 1988, 
in the sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve, a week after she reportedly left the 
world-renowned park while on a wildlife photography expedition. 
The state claimed that the 28-year-old woman was eaten by carnivores after 
abandoning her vehicle mired in mud. The Masai Mara is home to lions, vultures, 
hyenas and leopards among other meat eaters. 
Her father, John Ward, a hotelier from Suffolk, England, contended that she was 
murdered, hacked up and burned with gasoline. He pleaded with the state to 
order an inquest and spent tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours 
in a private investigation of her death. 
"There is ample and substantial evidence that Julie Ward died of foul play by a 
person or persons unknown," Chief Magistrate Joseph Mango said at the 
conclusion of his inquiry. 
In rejecting the state's contention that Ward had been killed by animals, Mango 
said: "I think the animals are innocent. If they are guilty at all, it is in 
eating what they found."
