CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; 
PROPOSITION 140; 
SUPPORTERS OF PROP. 140 OPEN CITIZENS DRIVE IN SANTA ANA 
Supporters of Proposition 140, which would limit terms of state officeholders, 
launched a "citizens campaign" Tuesday in Orange County to persuade voters to 
approve the measure. 
Flanked by a handful of backers, including Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden 
Grove), proposition treasurer Lewis K. Uhler said at a news conference that 
"career politicians" will fight the measure to keep their office. 
"Most incumbents do not support it," Uhler said. "But what we need are new 
faces in the state." 
Uhler said he expects opponents of the proposal to wage an expensive ad 
campaign. By contrast, the campaign for Proposition 140 will consist of a 
grass-roots effort that relies heavily on neighborhood walks and local meetings 
to spread the word. 
Uhler led supporters in signing a pink placard that read, "Official Prop. 140 
Pink Slip to Elected California State Officials." 
The measure, which is touted by supporters as "The Political Reform Act of 
1990," would limit the terms of state senators and statewide officeholders to 
eight years in office. Assemblymen would be restricted to six years. 
Assemblymen John R. Lewis (R-Orange), Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) and 
Pringle, plus State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), are among the Orange County 
legislators who support the measure, Uhler said. 
Pringle, who is completing his first term and is running against challenger Tom 
Umberg in the Nov. 6 election, said the measure would prevent "career 
politicians from running the state." 
"There have been people in the Legislature for 12 and 16 years," Pringle said. 
"That's getting carried away." 
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), the Republican gubernatorial candidate, 
endorsed the measure.
