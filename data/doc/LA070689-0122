THE NATION; 
REPUTED DRUG CARTEL MEMBER ARRAIGNED 
The reputed No. 3 man in Colombia's Cali drug cartel was arraigned in a Miami 
prison under tight security for fear fellow cocaine traffickers might try to 
free him, federal officials said. The Cali cartel -- a rival to the 
better-known Medellin cocaine cartel -- operates out of the city of Cali and 
has grabbed a growing share of Colombia's drug trade, Drug Enforcement 
Administration officials said. Luis Santacruz Echeverri, 35, was arraigned by 
U.S. Magistrate Samuel Smargon in a prison administrative office at the federal 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. Santacruz was indicted June 14 on 14 counts 
of cocaine possession and distribution in the seizure in July, 1987, of 2 1/2 
tons of cocaine. Santacruz pleaded innocent at the arraignment. No trial date 
has been set.
