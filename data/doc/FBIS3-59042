  [Text] Ankara (DPA) -- Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel met Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller in Ankara today. 
He was also received by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. 
Kinkel held joint consultations beforehand with Douglas Hurd 
and Hikmet Cetin, his British and Turkish counterparts,. 
  Kinkel said in Ankara that Bonn backed cultural autonomy for 
the Kurdish minority and firmly rejected frontier alterations in 
the region. He spoke in favor of a stronger regional role for 
Turkey, which was an important partner for Europe. Germany 
supported Ankara's efforts on the path toward the European Union 
(EU). 
  The meeting with Hurd and Cetin, which was organized at 
Kinkel's initiative, also focused on developments in the 
Balkans, the Caucasus, and Iraq. Kinkel said the talks 
highlighted Turkey's special role in Europe's new security 
structure at the frontier with Asia as well as between 
Christianity and Islam. 
  Ankara would have to carry out domestic reforms in the field 
of justice, for example, and still had "a certain amount of 
homework to do," Kinkel said. In this context, he drew 
attention to the human rights situation, the Kurdish question, 
and the fight against the banned militant separatist 
organization PKK (Workers Party of Kurdistan), as well as to the 
burden that Islamic fundamentalism posed for the NATO state 
Turkey. 
  He reaffirmed Germany's obligation to look after almost 2 
million Turks, who must not, however, be allowed to settle 
political disputes on German soil. "My party and I support dual 
nationality as well as local election voting rights for 
foreigners, including citizens from countries such as Turkey, 
which are associate EU members," Kinkel said.
