MOTHER OF BRITISH HOSTAGE DIES, HER WISH UNFULFILLED 
The mother of British hostage John McCarthy died of cancer Saturday without 
knowing whether her son, kidnaped in Lebanon more than three years ago, is 
alive. 
Sheila McCarthy, 66, died in a hospital in Cambridge, eastern England, a 
hospital spokesman said. 
John McCarthy, 32, a cameraman with Worldwide Television News, was kidnaped in 
Beirut in April, 1986. He is one of 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon. Nine are 
Americans. 
Early last week the family had issued a statement in Beirut pleading with 
McCarthy's kidnapers to set him free to allow a final reunion with his mother. 
"I urge you in the name of mercy, for which Islam is known, to fulfill the wish 
of a dying woman who wants to see her son before she dies," the family's 
statement in Arabic said.
