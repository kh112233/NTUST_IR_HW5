FT  19 JAN 93 / NCP chief executive 'spied on rival': Court hears that SAS
founder's firm was hired for industrial espionage
THE chief executive of National Car Parks hired a security firm started by
the founder of the Special Air Service to embark on industrial espionage
against Europarks, his main business rival, an Old Bailey jury heard
yesterday.
Europarks directors were followed to their homes, their dustbins were
searched for confidential information and a former woman Army captain
tricked her way into a secretarial job to gain access to business secrets,
said Mr David Paget, prosecuting.
Mr Gordon Layton, NCP chief executive, hired KAS, a security firm set up by
Colonel David Stirling, founder of the SAS, after Europarks began winning
lucrative contracts for car parks, Mr Paget said.
Mr Layton was concerned there was a leak from NCP to Europarks and wanted to
know how the company was getting business in the teeth of competition from
his own enterprise.
'The object . . . was so NCP could find out how Europarks worked, and
inevitably that information would be used for the benefit of NCP and place
at risk and cause loss to the business of Europarks,' he said.
At that time KAS was managed by Mr Ian Crook, a former Army colonel. When he
was out of the country Mr Simon Hewitt took over, Mr Paget said.
Mr Layton and Mr Hewitt both deny conspiring with Mr Crook, former Army
captain Ms Jane Turpin and others to defraud Europarks by dishonestly
acquiring information relating to its business affairs between January 1987
and November 1989.
Mr Hewitt also denies obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception in June
1989, when it is alleged he dishonestly obtained the opportunity for Ms
Turpin to earn money by working for Europarks.
Mr Crook is not facing charges as he lives in South Africa.
