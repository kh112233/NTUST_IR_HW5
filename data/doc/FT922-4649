FT  04 JUN 92 / Nato studies Europe peacekeeping role
NATO foreign ministers are meeting in Oslo to discuss a wider European
peacekeeping role for the alliance in the knowledge that the crisis in the
European Community, brought about by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht
treaty, can only enhance Nato's position as Europe's principal security
organisation.
The extent to which future European defence arrangements should be linked to
Nato or the European Community was already the subject of dispute between
France and Britain and though nothing can prevent the EC member countries
from pursuing their original aim, under Maastricht, of turning the
nine-nation Western European Union into a more effective instrument for
their own defence, the absence of an international treaty framework could
hamper the process.
Any relief at the new lease of life given to the alliance will not, however,
make it easier for Nato foreign ministers to reach agreement on a wider
peacekeeping role. No-one wants Nato to become 'a pan-European policeman,'
as Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, put it this week. But the
US, Britain and some other European allies want it to answer specific
requests to carry out peace-keeping activities by international
organisations such as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE) and the United Nations.
In sharp contrast to the US, which would like the European members to make a
new commitment to Nato to justify the administration's policy of maintaining
a military foothold in Europe, France wants any peace-keeping requests to be
made to individual member nations and not to Nato as an organisation.
Nato foreign ministers are also due to sign a new arms-control document,
together with representatives from the Commonwealth of Independent States,
under which the CIS states, individually, will undertake to carry out the
arms cuts agreed on by the former Soviet Union when it signed the
conventional forces in Europe (CFE) treaty in Paris at the end of 1990.
