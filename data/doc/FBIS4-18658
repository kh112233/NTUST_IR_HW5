<F P=106> [Report by Hannes Burger: "Bavaria Deports Militant Kurds </F>
Again"] 
  [Excerpt] Munich -- Bavaria has again issued deportation 
orders for five Kurds. This was announced yesterday by the 
Interior Ministry. More deportations are planned. Thus, orders 
have been issued for eight of the 13 arrested Kurds who 
participated in the Augsburg riots three weeks ago. 
  Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein (Christian 
Social Union) wants to discuss the deportation of militant Kurds 
in Bonn today and to speak in "very plain terms" with the 
government, particularly with Justice Minister 
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (Free Democratic Party of Germany). 
She has criticized the planned deportations in Bavaria.
