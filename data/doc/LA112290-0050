SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Appearing in Municipal Court for a hearing to review the status of his 
probation, Sagon Penn was ordered to find another psychological counselor after 
it was revealed that he was "suspicious" of his current therapist. 
Penn was ordered to undergo counseling as part of his probation in a 1989 case 
in which he was convicted of vandalizing a motorcycle belonging to a friend of 
his ex-girlfriend. 
After reviewing a letter from Penn's psychologist, Municipal Judge William H. 
Woodward said Wednesday that there was a "doctor-patient problem." 
Saying another six months of counseling sessions would be "helpful," Woodward 
ordered Penn to return to court Dec. 20 to report on his choice of a new 
psychologist. 
Woodward said Penn could terminate his sessions with his current doctor because 
of "a certain degree of suspicion being maintained by Mr. Penn." 
Penn, 28, was acquitted in two trials of the 1985 shooting deaths of a police 
officer and a civilian ride-along. Penn, who has had a number of brushes with 
law officers since the highly publicized trials, is facing a Nov. 30 trial on a 
felony charge of altering court documents.
