  [Text] 
  On Friday, eight banks, along with the Ministry of 
Finance and the central bank, decided to establish AS Eesti 
Vaartpaberite Keskdepositoorium [The Central 
Securities 
Depository Corporation of Estonia], which will administer a data 
base with complete information on all the securities being 
traded on the market. 
  The Securities Depository will maintain a registry of all 
officially issued securities and any buying and selling 
transactions involving them. The depository will have data on 
the prices and quantities of securities, on property put up as 
collateral for them, and other information regarding securities. 
The data in the central depository should make securities more 
trustworthy, and enable putting them up as collateral for loans. 
  Rein Usin, chairman of the board of Forekspank [Foreks 
Bank], 
said that plans call for setting up the depository within two 
months. The system would be developed by local specialists. A 
specialized system for the depository could have been purchased 
but, in addition to the high price (50 million kroons), this 
could have caused problems with compatibility.
