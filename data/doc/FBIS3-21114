  [Text] Nakayama Steel Works, Ltd. has developed and made 
practical a ``non-breeze sintered iron ore,'' a sintered iron 
ore, which is one of the main raw materials for blast furnaces, 
produced without using breeze (pulverized coke). The system is 
one in which metallic iron powder is used as an energy source 
instead of breeze to sinter pulverized iron ore, and the 
generation of CO[.sup]2[/] and NO[.sub]X[/] can be 
controlled to a great extent. Facilities for the process have 
already been built at the Nakayama Plant (Osaka), and start-up 
work is in progress. Actual operation will begin in April 1994. 
From the beginning, this was seen as being useful for reduction 
in energy consumption and improvement in the environment, but it 
is also seen as helping with recycling of scrap and waste steel 
from blast furnaces. Since this is the world's first example of 
this technology, it is drawing attention. 
  Sintered iron ore is produced by sintering iron ore with 
breeze, but during sintering, C0[.sup]2[/], NO[.sub]X[/] 
and sulfides are produced, and there are environmental problems. 
  The method developed by Nakayama Steel Works sinters 
metallic 
iron powder instead of breeze. The process is one in which the 
energy when metallic iron with a metallization ratio 
20-70% 
comes in contact with high-temperature air is used and iron ore 
is sintered. The main points are that high temperature exhaust 
gas of 200C to 300C is used, the ignition temperature 
of the powdered iron made uniform and the process speeded up. 
  In this way iron ore can be sintered homogeneously, and the 
amount of iron powder can be reduced. In addition, it is said 
that the sintered ore obtained from this process has excellent 
reduction and cold strength. 
  The newly completed facility consists of a hot blast unit 
for 
recycling the high-temperature portion of gas exhausted from the 
sintering process and a wet electrostatic precipitator for 
purifying the exhaust gas. This facility makes for a large 
reduction in NO[.sup]X[/] in the exhaust gas. In addition, 
the amounts of sulfides and C0[.sup]2[/] exhausted are near 
zero, so this one step toward the realization of a clean steel 
works. 
  The material for the iron powder used here is the portion of 
the waste iron generated by the blast furnace that cannot be 
used as raw material for an electric steel furnace, so there is 
the merit of recycling. In addition, not using breeze there 
results in a reduction of more than 200 million in annual costs.
