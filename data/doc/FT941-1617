FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo grants Wellcome option over 3TC drug
Glaxo has granted Wellcome an option to develop and market the compound 3TC,
which is in final clinical trials, for treatment of the HIV virus.
Glaxo, which licensed the drug from BioChem Pharma of Canada in 1990, would
continue clinical development of the compound for the treatment of hepatitis
B.
Part of the current trials for HIV involve the use of 3TC in conjunction
with Wellcome's anti-Aids drug Retrovir.
Glaxo said there was increasing evidence that such 'combination therapy' was
the most promising approach to HIV treatment and that the proposed
arrangement would represent the most efficient way of bringing 3TC to
market.
Wellcome is likely to decide whether to exercise the option after the trial
results are available towards the end of this year.
This would trigger a further payment to Glaxo.
Once marketed, Wellcome would make royalty payments to Glaxo based on sales
and Glaxo in turn would pay royalties to BioChem Pharma.
Glaxo has an 17 per cent stake in BioChem, a research-based pharmaceuticals
company formed in 1986 which is quoted on the Montreal and Toronto stock
exchanges and on Nasdaq.
