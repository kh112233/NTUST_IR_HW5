<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Proposed rule; withdrawal.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This action withdraws the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) published in the 

Federal Register

 on October 15, 1993. The NPRM proposed to alter the descriptions of VOR Federal Airways V7, V51, V97,
and V399, respectively, by reducing the standard width of these airways. The FAA has determined that withdrawal
of the proposal at this time is warranted because a change in air traffic control (ATC) procedures would alleviate
the need to alter these airways. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

This withdrawal is effective January 12, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On October 15, 1993, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was published in the 

Federal Register

 to amend 14 CFR part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to alter the descriptions of V7, V51, V97,
and V399, respectively, by reducing the standard width of these airways located in the states of Indiana and
Illinois (58 FR 53459). This action was proposed to redefine the lateral boundaries of the airways to provide for more
efficient utilization of the airspace. No comments were received on the proposal.



The FAA has decided to withdraw the proposal at this time to provide an opportunity to reexamine the operations effecting
these airways in the Lafayette Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)
areas. This proposal was initiated to simplify air traffic operations and to provide for more efficient utilization
of that airspace. The FAA has determined that changing the ATC procedures and delegating to Chicago ARTCC the control
responsibility previously handled by Lafayette ATCT would alleviate the need to alter these airways.
