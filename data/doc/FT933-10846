FT  02 AUG 93 / Curriculum cuts urged
RADICAL PROPOSALS to slim down the national curriculum for schools in
England and Wales and to concentrate on basic skills will be presented to
the government today by Sir Ron Dearing, chairman-designate of the Schools
Curriculum and Assessment Authority.
The interim report of Sir Ron's review of school curriculum and testing will
agree with critics who have accused the national curriculum of being too
prescriptive.
His report will recommend reducing the curriculum to occupy less than 75 per
cent of the school day and concentrating on fewer subjects in the compulsory
tests carried out at the ages of seven, 11, 14 and 16.
Sir Ron will also recommend investigation of new ways of presenting the
results of the tests. The use of the results for compiling school league
tables has aroused intense opposition among teachers.
Among the options are the use of 'value-added' measures of school
performance to recognise the achievement of schools that get good results in
difficult circumstances.
The interim report will be received by Baroness Blatch, the education
minister, on behalf of Mr John Patten, the education secretary, who has been
suffering from a viral infection.
Lady Blatch is expected to announce whether the government will proceed with
publishing the results of this year's tests for seven-year-olds and
14-year-olds.
As most schools have boycotted the tests, the data submitted to the
Department for Education is likely to be too patchy to be of value in
compiling league tables.
