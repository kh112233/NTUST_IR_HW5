<F P=106> [Article by Tiiu Metsa: "Direct Investments In Estonia Kept </F>
Growing In 1993"] 
  [Text] 
  During the year of 1993, investments of foreign 
companies that were made in their joint ventures in Estonia 
amounted to 2,232.4 million kroons, while direct investments of 
Estonian companies made abroad amounted to 103.6 million 
kroons. 
  Estonia's investments abroad may be small, compared to the 
influx of capital coming our way, but what matters, in the 
opinion of Tiiu Metsa, head specialist at the Bank of Estonia, 
is that these were made basically during the second half of the 
year. 
  Fifty-five percent of direct investments in Estonia came 
from 
increases in venture capital, 29 percent from increases in loan 
capital, and 16 percent from reinvested proceeds. 
  Viewed by the total volume of direct investments 
made in Estonia, Finland placed first with 32.3 percent, 
followed by Sweden (29 percent), The Netherlands (5.9 percent), 
Switzerland (4.4 percent), Italy (3 percent), Russia (2.6 
percent), and Germany (2.4 percent). 
  Investments of venture capital, so vital to 
Estonia, kept growing during 1993, amounting to 1,233 million 
kroons. Foreign investors poured 764 million kroons into new 
ventures started in 1993. The capital resources of joint 
ventures already operational were increased by 388.6 million 
kroons. Proceeds from the privatization of state enterprises to 
non-residents yielded 80.4 million kroons, while 63.3 million or 
close to 80 percent of that amount came to Estonia during the 
fourth quarter. 
<H5>  Who Are the Partners? </H5>
  According to the Bureau of Statistics enterprise register, 
the greatest number of joint ventures were formed with Finnish 
companies (1,551), followed by Sweden (301), Russia (253), and 
Germany and the United States, with 126 companies each. But 
looking at the average volume of capital invested per 
enterprise, we see Hungary taking the lead (4.7 million kroons), 
followed by Italy (4 million), United States (1.5 million), The 
Bahamas (1.2 million), Turkey (1.1 million), Sweden (0.9 
million) and Switzerland (0.8 million). 
  By the average amount of venture capital invested in each, 
however, Finland ranks 34th, Russia 30th, and Germany 24th among 
the 56 countries that have started new business ventures in 
Estonia. Thus, most of the joint ventures formed with Finland, 
Russia and Germany were relatively small. 
  Currently, Swedish investors are making significant 
cooperation partners for Estonian companies. Even though Sweden 
holds second place after Finland for the number of new ventures, 
it is way ahead of Finland by the volume of capital invested in 
them. During 1993, Swedish companies invested 272.4 million 
kroons in new Estonian ventures (the corresponding indicator for 
Finland is 188 million kroons). 
  The flow of capital into joint ventures already operational 
is made up of 228.9 million kroons or 59 percent coming from 
Swedish companies; 108.9 million kroons (or 28 percent of the 
total) coming from Finland; and 35.5 milliom kroons (or 9 
percent of the total) coming from Switzerland. The rest of the 
countries contributed considerably less to the influx of 
capital, adding up to a combined total of around 4 percent. 
  For 1993, the difference for investors between disbursements 
and repayments of long term loans was 169.3 million 
kroons. Since obtaining long-term loans does not follow a steady 
pattern, the difference between their disbursements and 
repayments varied quite a bit for each quarter. Most of the 
long-term foreign loans came to Estonia during the second and 
the fourth quarters. The largest extenders of long-term loans 
were direct investors from Finland and Austria (143.3 million 
kroons and 101.4 million kroons respectively).

  The difference between disbursements and repayments of 
short term loans (including commercial credit) and 
reinvested proceeds grew considerably during 1993. 
Even though these growth items were somewhat smaller for the 
fourth quarter than they were for the third, one can conclude 
increased momentum and effectiveness in the cooperation of 
Estonian companies with their foreign partners. 
  The economic sector preferred by foreign investors 
last year was industry, where 45 percent of the direct 
investments were channeled. That was followed by wholesale and 
retail trade (26 percent), finance (8 percent), real estate, 
leasing and business services (7 percent).
