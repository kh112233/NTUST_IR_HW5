EARNINGS 
ICN Pharmaceuticals reported that its net income fell 46% to $3 million in the 
second quarter ended May 31, compared to $5.6 million in the same period a year 
earlier. Revenue was up 9% to $44.5 million from $40.7 million. The Costa 
Mesa-based pharmaceutical company blamed the reduced earnings partly on higher 
research costs associated with the development of ribavirin, a compound used to 
treat infants and young children with lower respiratory tract infections.
