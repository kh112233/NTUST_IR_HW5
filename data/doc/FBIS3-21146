  [Text] The Government Industrial Research Institute, Osaka, 
(GIRI, Osaka) of the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology 
(AIST) has been successful in an experimental conversion of 
carbon dioxide (CO[.sup]2[/])into methanol using gold, which 
has been thought to be chemically inactive, as a catalyst. At a 
temperature of 250C, about 50C lower than with a 
copper catalyst, the same degree of efficiency in methanol 
synthesis was possible. Along with being useful for fixation and 
recovery of atmospheric CO[.sup]2[/], which is a cause of 
global warming, this also has applications in systems for 
converting hydrogen into methanol and transporting it. 
  The gold catalyst experiment was carried out by Masaki 
Haruta, the head, and Hiroaki Sakurai, a researcher, of the 
Catalytic Chemistry Laboratory of GIRI, Osaka. When a mixture of 
CO[.sup]2[/] and hydrogen gasses under a pressure of 50 
atmospheres was passed through iron oxide affixed to gold, 
approximately 5% of the CO[.sup]2[/] combined with hydrogen 
to form methanol. The gold and iron oxide exhibited the greatest 
activity at 250C. Copper and zinc oxide is known as a 
catalyst for converting CO[.sup]2[/] into methanol, and the 
gold catalyst has the same synthesis efficiency as this. In 
addition, the copper catalyst exhibits the greatest activity at 
a temperature of 300C, and at 250C, the gold/iron 
oxide catalyst is more efficient. 
  Following this, GIRI, Osaka plans to mix in aluminum oxide, 
etc., and make smaller granules of gold to increase the 
activity. Conventionally, gold is considered to have poor 
chemical activity and not to be useful as a catalyst, but 
recently researchers have learned that it converts carbon 
monoxide (CO) into C0[.sup]2[/] at a temperature of -70C 
and can separate out the odorous components of trimethylamine. 
  Methanol is a basic chemical product that is also raw 
material for thermosetting resins, but recently conversion of 
hydrogen, which has the danger of exploding, into methanol for 
transportation has attracted attention. The ``WE-NET Concept'' 
proposed by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI) is a project for using the solar energy of overseas 
deserts to separate water and generate hydrogen and react the 
hydrogen with CO[.sup]2[/] to generate methanol for 
transportation, and practical research is being started this 
year.
