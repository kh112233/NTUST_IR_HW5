  [Text] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus spoke to Czech Radio 
about the dismissal of Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar: 
  It is in the interest of the Czech Republic that Slovakia is 
a stable, prospering state, and for this it needs a government 
that enjoys the trust of the Slovak public. The Czech 
Government also needs a partner. This is why we hope that the 
Slovak Government crisis is quickly over. I would like to thank 
Prime Minister Meciar and the outgoing Slovak Cabinet for their 
correct attitude with regard to Czech-Slovak relations and, 
above all, for our joint patient search for constructive 
solutions in the tense moments when our common state was 
splitting.
