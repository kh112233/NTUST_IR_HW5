FT  27 SEP 93 / The Labour Party at Brighton: Benn may lose in NEC shift to
right
THE rightward drift of Labour's national executive committee (NEC) is
expected to be confirmed when election results are announced today.
The most prominent left-wing casualty is likely to be Mr Tony Benn, MP for
Chesterfield, who has been a member for 34 consecutive years.
Ironically, the main threat to Mr Benn, 68, stems from the introduction of
positive discrimination in favour of women candidates - a policy to which he
has given his full support.
From this year, one of the seven constituency party seats on the NEC is
reserved for a female candidate as part of Labour's attempts to make the
party more attractive to women. Two of the seven seats will be reserved next
year, and three in 1995.
Mr Benn, who describes himself as 'an old fashioned radical democrat', came
seventh in the constituency section last year, and is considered the most
vulnerable to defeat.
Attention will also focus on the level of support for supporters of the
'modernising' wing, led by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, and Mr
Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary.
