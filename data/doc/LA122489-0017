SLOUCHING TOWARD THE MILLENNIUM; 
PROGNOSTICATIONS, PROPHECIES AND JUST PLAIN GUESSES ABOUT WHAT THE LAST DECADE 
OF THE 20TH CENTURY WILL BRING 
THE WORLD CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY in the 1980s, particularly in the past few 
months, that at times one felt nostalgic about last week. The 1980s saw the 
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe; the diagnosis of a deadly disease -- 
AIDS -- that has escalated into a worldwide epidemic, and the ascendancy of 
American conservatism. Indeed, so much changed so rapidly in the waning years 
of the decade that the prospect of contemplating more U-turns in the 1990s 
makes one a bit lightheaded. 
But these are vertiginous times, like it or not. The calendar dictates a new 
decade, ready or not. We aren't reckless or presumptuous enough to try to label 
the '90s before they arrive, but we thought it might be wise to ask for help in 
preparing for the next spin of the wheel of history. 
Many of the specialists we queried were ill at ease about trying to gaze into 
the future. Because events have a way of embarrassing horse-racing handicappers 
and denim salesmen, the squeamishness evoked by questions about peace, 
economics and environmental issues is understandable. But, with a little 
prodding, we came up with a panel of 14 prophets who speculated, wondered, 
expounded, hedged and warned about the coming years. Two main currents stand 
out: sweeping optimism and chilling pessimism. 
So don't expect a dull decade. And don't blame us if they turn out to be wrong. 
THE ENVIRONMENT: DAVID R. BROWER 
Brower, a leader in conservation issues for 50 years, is chairman of the San 
Francisco-based environmental group Earth Island Institute. 
THERE HAS TO be in the coming decade a major move toward restoration of the 
earth. We've got to put back together, as well as we can, the things we took 
apart since the Industrial Revolution. It was a big party. Now the bills are 
coming in: global warming, acid rain, holes in the ozone layer, loss of species 
and loss of hope. We've got to turn that all around. All we can do is give 
nature a chance. If we continue the worst addiction of all -- the addiction to 
gasoline -- nature won't get that chance. 
Of course we're going to do it. All we have to do is say that's where we want 
to go. We can't restore the rain forest, but we can give it our best stab. As 
for global warming, it's certainly going to be slowed down, and we'd better 
reverse it. The last moment -- or the next to the last moment -- has arrived. 
As somebody said, "The threat of being hanged gets one's attention." 
Ironically, it is the pessimism of others that makes me optimistic. The very 
strength of Bill McKibben's presentation in his book, "The End of Nature," will 
draw attention. So will the Conservation Foundation-sponsored report on toxic 
chemical pollution in the Great Lakes and its threat to fish, birds, mammals, 
reptiles and 35 million people. 
There are several great pieces of news: Mercedes is developing a car that burns 
hydrogen. The Valdez Principles (a code of conduct recently introduced by a 
coalition of environmental groups, religious organizations and investors) are 
suggesting what big and small investors in big corporations can require them to 
do to be socially responsible. The Council on Economic Priorities has put out a 
booklet, "Shopping for a Better World," telling people which corporations are 
doing well environmentally and which aren't. We can invest and vote with our 
purchases every day. 
RACE RELATIONS: ALVIN POUSSAINT 
Poussaint is an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and 
a senior associate in psychiatry at the Judge Baker Children's Center in 
Boston. He is the author of "Why Blacks Kill Blacks" and co-author of "Black 
Child Care." 
I'M A LITTLE PESSIMISTIC about race relations in this country during the 1990s 
because of the number of new immigrants, particularly Hispanic Americans and 
Asians. They will be competing for jobs. We already have animosity between 
blacks and Latinos. We still have a lot of poverty in black and Hispanic 
communities. A recent congressional report indicated that 50% of black children 
in the United States live in poverty. They are more likely than other young 
people to be involved in drugs and crime or to be killed. 
With the general population feeling threatened, all the issues such as drugs 
and crime are going to come out in racial terms. There will be more 
segregation. And with the sliding backward of affirmative action and set-aside 
programs, you leave people in power who were in power before. There is more 
cronyism and nepotism. 
There are disturbing signs that the advances since the 1960s are fading. 
College enrollment of blacks is declining. In the past 15 years, the number of 
blacks in medical schools has not gone up. 
There has been the killing of blacks by whites at Howard Beach and in the 
Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and the attack by black youths on a white woman 
jogger in Central Park. There was the battle between the police of Virginia 
Beach and a crowd of predominantly black students. These incidents further 
polarize the two groups, raising the levels of animosity and fear. After years 
of quiescence, there have been racial incidents on college campuses that hadn't 
had any before. 
The post-Martin Luther King generation, young people with negative feelings 
toward a lot of groups -- somehow they feel legitimacy in expressing these 
views. Despite the success of black athletes that white kids worship, too, 
despite a black Miss America, despite TV shows such as Bill Cosby's, feelings 
of racism don't seem to be eradicated. People are segregated, so they're still 
basically prejudiced. That may change with the next generation, but not with 
these kids. The polls show they still have the same attitudes as their parents. 
There is one bright spot. I think we're going to have more black elected 
officials, more participation in the process. That's because there is a growing 
black population and a growing sophistication. As blacks gain political power, 
they can make things happen. 
EDUCATION: VARTAN GREGORIAN 
Gregorian is president of Brown University. A historian and former University 
of Pennsylvania provost, Gregorian revitalized the New York Public Library 
during seven years as its president. 
EDUCATION IN America faces three crises during the 1990s: for one, a shortage 
of 1.1 million high school and elementary school teachers and of 500,000 
professors. So where is our seed corn? And who will educate the educators? 
Second, 23 million to 30 million Americans are functionally illiterate. We also 
face a third crisis: the shortage of skilled labor, due to demographic factors; 
the decline of the birthrate, and high school dropouts, especially in the inner 
cities. 
Related to all of this is that in this country we don't have a gestalt approach 
to education. There is a great lack of philosophical, educational, 
administrative and organizational unity. As a result, the colleges and the 
universities are expected to solve and resolve the neglect and malpreparation 
of our high school students. More and more, the first two years of college 
resemble the last two years of high school. 
During the '90s, our educational issues will be compounded by social issues: 
poverty, the breakdown of families and the ravage of drugs. Unless we're able 
to solve the economic and social issues simultaneously, we will have an 
underclass that will drag America down economically. As Europe and Asia become 
strong, we will no longer be able to draw skilled immigrants -- only the 
unskilled, compounding the problem of educating the waves of them coming in. 
We have to revitalize our schools, not just give speeches. It's going to 
require a massive infusion of funds for laboratories and the teaching of math 
and science. We must join our forces and faculties to fight the nation's No. 1 
crisis. Fortress America will not be a fortress if our foundations are 
corroding. 
ART: RICHARD KOSHALEK 
Koshalek has been director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles 
since 1983, after having served as its deputy director and chief curator. 
THE CASCADE OF change in the 1980s will continue into the '90s. To manage such 
change is going to be the major problem confronting cultural institutions, 
whether they be MOCA, a theater, a concert hall or a dance company. The most 
important issue confronting museums will be developing broad-based educational 
programs that will lead visitors to a more sensitive understanding and 
appreciation of the arts. 
The increasing valuation of works of art is going to have an effect on museums, 
especially museums of contemporary art. The art market is so competitive and so 
inflated with regard to artists competing internationally that these museums 
will have to be more flexible. They can't always have the well-known works, so 
they will have to look for other sources. We might see greater interest in the 
work of artists working within the region a museum is associated with, such as 
the light-and-space artists working in California, and a greater emphasis by 
museums in acquiring the work of emerging and under-recognized artists. The art 
market will continue to move higher in very select areas and in the work of 
certain artists, but, overall, I see a leveling off of valuation increases 
throughout the '90s. 
Museums will be more international in their outlook. There will have to be a 
greater interconnecting of artists between the institutions, exchange programs 
with museums in Japan and South America, not just Europe. Curators from 
different continents will put together joint shows and share them. Artists will 
become more concerned about originality and will be influenced by a wide range 
of sources, such as mass communication, architecture and urban planning and new 
technologies such as video and high-resolution television. 
FOOD: JULIA CHILD 
Child has taught cooking to millions through her books and television shows. 
Her latest book is "The Way to Cook." 
WE'RE GOING through a very bad period when people don't have much information 
about their food. They're inclined to get hysterical about things. A good 
example was the scare over the use of the chemical Alar on apples. There was 
such a hysterical pitch that it clearly crippled the apple industry and 
deprived children of healthy foods. Cholesterol is another place where we're 
getting into hysteria. People don't know what all of that means. You have to 
have a certain amount of fat, and if you take too much fiber, you're going to 
get diarrhea. The point is moderation -- eating sensibly and exercising. Every 
fat calorie you eat should be a pleasure. You should know what you're doing and 
enjoy every mouthful. That's what's going to happen: We will have more sense, 
go back to the pleasures of the table in a reasonable way. I think we'll go 
back to simple foods -- baked potatoes. 
People keep saying, "I don't have time to cook." We have fast foods and all 
that sort of thing. I think that's beginning to change. People are finding it 
doesn't take so long to cook. You really need family life at home. It's much 
nicer to eat at home than at a fast-food joint. You know what you're eating. 
There has been a great improvement in supermarket produce. That availability 
will continue. The influence of immigrants on American eating habits is 
fascinating, the tremendous emergence of all those Mexican foods and others 
from South America. Chinese seems to have toned down a little bit while Thai 
has gone up. Sichuan and Japanese foods seem to be coming up. I think this will 
continue. A lot of Oriental dishes are very healthy. Of course, some people are 
afraid of raw fish. . . . 
BUSINESS: JOHN F. WELCH JR. 
Welch has been chairman and chief executive officer of General Electric since 
1981. 
THE CHALLENGE for business people is to take advantage of broader, expanding 
markets. With the world so intertwined, there is very little incentive for any 
country not to work with other countries to sustain a consistent pattern of 
global growth. 
The United States grew rapidly during the '50s and '60s. There was a dramatic 
increase in the standard of living and relatively benign global competition. 
Then, in the '70s, we focused too much on how to manage all this growth. We 
lost position to Europe and Japan. The '80s were a reaction to the '70s. 
Mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts were getting some of the fat out of 
the corporations -- a hardware restructuring. The U.S. became much more 
productive. 
We're going from a decade of hardware to a decade of software -- the human 
element -- as we drive to spread responsibility through companies. To win in 
the '90s, companies are going to have to increase the speed of decision making, 
the speed of bringing products to market and putting proposals together. 
Companies will move to give more responsibility, more authority and more 
freedom to individuals, asking them to use their creativity to increase 
production. 
Business won't be able to bring a product to market, build a new facility or 
complete a merger that won't take into account the impact on the environment. 
Words like recyclable will become common terms. The massive trend toward 
deregulation during the 1980s will moderate and perhaps reverse -- although not 
back to where we were. 
The acquisition of U.S. businesses and property by the Japanese and other 
foreign investors should lead to greater productivity here, greater taxable 
income, a higher standard of living, more jobs and yet greater investment. 
POLITICS: ARTHUR M. SCHLESINGER JR. 
Schlesinger, a writer, historian and educator, is Schweitzer professor of 
humanities at City University of New York. He served as special assistant to 
President John F. Kennedy and has won Pulitzer prizes for history and 
biography. 
THE CONSERVATIVE 1980s were a re-enactment of the conservative 1950s, as the 
1950s were a re-enactment of the conservative 1920s. In similar fashion we have 
liberal periods at 30-year intervals: Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive 
Era in 1901; Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal in the 1930s; John F. Kennedy 
and the New Frontier in the 1960s. If the rhythm holds, the national mood in 
the 1990s will be much more like the Progressive Era and the 1930s and the 
1960s than like the conservative 1980s. 
There is no mystery about the 30-year cycle. That is the span of a generation. 
People tend to be formed by the ideas that prevail when they become politically 
conscious. Kennedy touched and formed a political generation. That generation's 
time should come in the 1990s. 
It looks as if the tide is beginning to turn. The recent off-year elections in 
New York, New Jersey and Virginia constituted, as pollster Louis Harris put it, 
"a vote for activist government." President Bush's rhetoric on education, the 
environment, housing, day care and so on represents a clear departure from 
hard-line Reaganite conservatism. 
Mr. Bush's problem is that people will soon begin to see a gap between his 
rhetoric and his action. He has been reluctant in a variety of fields to 
mobilize the resources necessary to redeem his promises. I am afraid that Mr. 
Bush's "no-new-taxes" pledge is condemning the country to impotence, both at 
home and abroad. We can't repair our collapsing bridges and dams, we can't 
house the homeless, we can't improve our schools, we can't give much help to 
countries like Poland struggling toward democracy -- all because of the tax 
taboo. And polls show that Americans are quite ready to pay taxes for 
particular things they care about. We need to recognize that it is impossible 
for us to remain a great nation without paying for it. 
Abortion will turn out to be a major mistake for George Bush. Nobody is wildly 
enthusiastic about abortion. But most people feel that the choice should be 
made by the woman involved. Bush's anti-abortion stand has created special 
problems for the Republicans, who have become a coalition of aspiring 
free-enterprisers, who believe in personal liberty, and evangelical zealots, 
who believe in enforcing morality. The Bush line will make it harder for 
suburbanites and yuppies to vote Republican in the future. 
RELIGION: MARTIN E. MARTY 
Marty, professor of church history at the University of Chicago, is the author 
of "Pilgrims in Their Own Land: 500 Years of Religion in America." 
AMERICAN CHURCHES are very busy adjusting to change. Conservative religion in 
America was galvanized by the image of the Soviet Union as the "evil empire." 
Now the revival of Jewish and Christian faiths in Russia and the relative 
increase of freedom in other East European nations are confusing and liberating 
all at once. Meanwhile, the real dynamism in Christianity is in the southern 
world -- Latin America, Asia, Malaysia. The contest is between Christianity and 
Islam in some of those places, while in Latin America it is between Protestants 
and Catholics. 
Catholicism will be marked by the shortage of priests and nuns and the 
continuing failure of many American Catholics to pay attention to the church on 
such issues as birth control. Nevertheless, Catholicism will remain America's 
largest religious bloc. 
As for conservative Protestants, the TV evangelists and the scandals in the 
movement have led the serious ones to see they have to go back to basics, not 
be so flamboyant and worldly. 
American Jews on one hand are participating in a widespread recovery of 
tradition, but at the same time many are less ready to fashion their identity 
in relation to Israel. The debate over who is a Jew hurt the majority of 
American religious Jews badly. The response by Israel to the intifada has 
created some conscience problems. Toward the end of the '90s we'll be getting 
close to having as many Muslims as Jews in this country, so we'll no longer be 
a WASP or Judeo-Christian nation. 
MEDICINE: KENNETH T. SHINE 
Shine has been dean of UCLA's School of Medicine since 1986. He is a 
cardiologist and former president of the American Heart Assn. 
WE'RE ALMOST certain to see fundamental changes in the way health care is 
financed. The rate of growth in health-care costs demands some kind of 
solution. Both the elderly and the corporate communities will be pushing for 
some kind of basic health insurance that will include providing health care for 
the poor and uninsured. The biggest problem we have is making health care 
available to the uninsured. Five million Californians are uninsured. Two-thirds 
of those are people who work and don't have adequate insurance. 
Scientifically, I think the most exciting development in the '90s will be the 
capacity to match the genome, the genetic structure of the human body. If the 
genetic code for humans can be unraveled, we could eliminate specific genetic 
abnormalities. By the end of the decade, I would anticipate that one could 
identify perhaps 10,000 genes in a newborn or in an adult. This will allow the 
identification of predisposition to a variety of diseases and disorders. It 
would be possible to determine whether someone is at risk for diabetes, 
hypertension or a variety of things. 
And it is very likely that by the end of the '90s there will be some genetic 
treatment -- gene therapy. But that's going to mean that the '90s will also be 
a time of greater concern about ethics, not only in genetic therapy but also in 
the area of health care and what is appropriate treatment. 
It's possible genetic therapy could be useful in the treatment of cancer and 
AIDS, but it won't start there. It will start with a specific disorder where 
there is a known single genetic defect. 
One exciting area is the expanding knowledge of cancer through the genetic 
regulation of oncogenes, the genes identified as causing cancer in humans. This 
is particularly exciting in offering a promise for prevention as well as 
treatment for cancer. This includes a better understanding of the way 
environmental agents -- some of the toxins we are exposed to -- alter genetic 
regulation and therefore predispose a person to cancer. 
As a cardiologist, I'm very excited about the expanding understanding of 
cholesterol, metabolism and the way in which fat gets deposited in blood vessel 
walls. There'll be many new ways to prevent the blockage of blood vessels by 
fat. People are living healthier life styles. Life expectancy has gone up over 
the past 20 years. 
There is a good chance that a successful vaccine against AIDS will be developed 
in the next decade. People are beginning to get clues to the way the virus 
behaves. It's a virus that changes its colors very frequently. There are some 
outstanding minds working on the problem, and I think they are making progress. 
FASHION: ANNA WINTOUR 
Wintour became editor of Vogue nearly a year and a half ago. A former 
editor-in-chief of British Vogue, she also has been an editor at Harper's 
Bazaar, New York magazine and American Vogue. 
IN LOOKING AHEAD to the '90s, it's important to look at what happened in the 
'80s. First of all, there was the enormous influence of fitness. Whether you're 
looking at Jane Fonda or the New York Marathon, the fitness boom has had a 
tremendous influence in terms of fabrics and ease of clothes -- whether women 
were wearing sneakers in the street, with the way women were feeling much 
better about the way their bodies look. Azzedine Alaia is kind of the king of 
stretch or body-fitness clothes -- sexy and fashionable and desirable at the 
same time. That's going to go on into the '90s. 
We first saw the power suit during the '80s. That came out of the Italian 
designers, kind of an aggressive look; women in the workplace. I think that was 
very important in the '80s. Another thing: It was the decade of black. 
Everywhere you went you saw women in black, a sea of black. We saw the enormous 
influence Karl Lagerfeld had at Chanel; he made women more approachable, 
feminine, attractive. 
Looking ahead to the '90s -- to next season, at least -- I think we'll see a 
move away from this power dressing, the aggressive look. The word I'm hearing 
is soft. Women want to look more feminine, prettier; less of a uniform 
approach, more of a personal style. At the same time, the athletic, more 
relaxed approach is going to be very important. In the most recent collections, 
we saw very chic jackets thrown over a kind of bicycling-jogging suit. And I 
think we're going to see the emergence of very young designers such as Isaac 
Misrahi and Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors, which is great for my profession. We 
haven't had a group of new designers for a while. This would give us an 
injection. 
SPORTS: HARRY EDWARDS 
Sports sociologist Edwards is a professor at UC Berkeley and a consultant to 
Major League Baseball assigned to help bring nonwhites into coaching and 
management. He is also a consultant to the San Francisco 49ers and the Golden 
State Warriors. 
COMMERCIALISM IS going to be the dominant force in athletics during the 1990s. 
We have a situation where, owing to the money available, the number of Major 
League Baseball regular-season games telecast on network television have 
dropped to 16 for the coming year. Everything else is going to be on pay cable. 
That will virtually eliminate access to live baseball for vast segments of the 
population, including those segments that have provided tremendous player 
personnel resources. The rural poor white kids and the inner-city black kids -- 
the (future) Rickey Hendersons, the Frank Robinsons, the Vada Pinsons -- are 
not going to have access. The time is long past when kids could go peer through 
a knothole in the fence and watch their heroes. Eliminating that access is 
eventually going to hurt baseball because these are the athletes of the future. 
We can expect a tremendous influx of foreign athletes with the growing 
internationalization of sports, thanks to the satellites. The attractiveness of 
bringing in foreign athletes who will be heroes for foreign markets is probably 
going to be very difficult to ignore. This means tens of millions of new fans, 
opening a tremendous market for sports paraphernalia. Right now, if you look at 
the NBA, Africa is represented. Russia is represented. Czechoslovakia is 
represented. Yugoslavia is represented. Growing internationalization could 
erode the tradition of American sports and the involvement of the typical 
American fans who find sports heroes appealing because they can identify with 
them. Now they've got to break through all sorts of cultural barriers. They 
probably can't even pronounce the name of Sarunas Marciulionis, who is on the 
Warriors roster and is the first Russian to play in the NBA. So commercialism 
will remove a degree of identification with the players for the fans here at 
home. 
Satellite communications is going to bring more sports from more places than we 
have ever experienced into the American living room. We are going to have to 
come to grips with the fact that sports can reach a saturation point. Last 
basketball season, on a Saturday afternoon, I turned on my satellite and had 
access to 13 basketball games within a five-hour period. I watched a little bit 
of each of them. As one got boring, I switched to something else. At the end, I 
not only didn't know who had won, I didn't know who had played whom. And I was 
bored by most of it. More is not necessarily better. 
SCIENCE: RICHARD C. ATKINSON 
Atkinson, the chancellor of UC San Diego, is president of the American Assn. 
for the Advancement of Science and former director of the National Science 
Foundation. 
WE ARE GOING TO have a tremendous shortfall of scientists as we move toward the 
21st Century. If corrective actions are not taken immediately, by early next 
century the annual supply of Ph.Ds in this country will be about 10,500 -- 
versus a demand for about 18,000. This will dramatically affect our ability to 
maintain our scientific leadership and economic capabilities. That's the 
overriding issue that relates to the health of American science, whether we're 
going to attract the talent to keep the enterprise rolling. Too many young 
people are going off to law school and MBA programs. Or they get bachelor's 
degrees and then get recruited by industry without getting Ph.Ds. We pay such 
high salaries in fields such as computer science and the like that these people 
aren't willing to stay on for the Ph.Ds. This will be a problem even if the 
shrinking defense budget causes fewer scientists to gravitate toward defense 
research. 
In terms of science itself, on every front there are simply spectacular 
developments. What's happening in the neurosciences is absolutely 
mind-boggling. Information that's being accumulated about the nature of the 
neuron and the molecular processes involved in neurotransmission is going to 
open up a totally new view of the nature of the human mind and of psychological 
issues. Every psychological mood and condition will probably relate to some 
aspect of the transmitters, allowing us to research and study every facet of an 
individual's personality. 
Molecular and cellular biology is simply revolutionary in terms of its impact 
on medicine. Our neurosurgeons at UCSD, for example, are anticipating 
implanting into the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease genes that would 
generate an increased level of certain neurotransmitters that we believe are 
related to the disease. There's no question that this can happen during the 
coming decade. 
Things are rolling at such a fast rate that to make predictions is very 
difficult. It's clear that in fields such as physics, the superconducting 
supercollider will be a major scientific instrument. Also, I think there's a 
renewed interest in nuclear fusion as a source of energy. 
Then you've got this whole development of new techniques for visual imaging -- 
the ability, through nuclear magnetic resonance and other procedures, to 
literally image the structure of a molecule or something even smaller. We can 
image the activities of the brain. In physics and chemistry, in the 
neurosciences, billions and billions of observations can be put together by a 
computer to provide images. We can literally see the structure of particular 
molecules, the form they are and why they interact the way they do. If we can 
understand the structure of a molecule, we can create chemicals that mimic the 
structures found in the body. 
When the space telescope gets up there next spring, we may find ourselves with 
a completely new view of the universe. It will have the capacity to see farther 
and in more detail than we've ever been able to before. Everywhere along the 
way the excitement is spectacular. 
WORLD AFFAIRS: WARREN CHRISTOPHER 
Christopher is chairman of the L.A. law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers. As 
deputy secretary of state in the Carter Administration, he was chief negotiator 
in freeing the U.S. hostages in Iran. 
THE UNITED STATES will have to develop a whole new strategy for a dramatically 
changed world. With the diminished burden of the heavy cost of armaments, we 
have a chance to address a new agenda -- and just in the nick of time. Because 
of that easing of arms costs, we are likely during the coming decade to have an 
opportunity to concentrate on environmental and economic issues to a degree 
that has not been possible in the past. This can lead to a better life for the 
disadvantaged here as well as elsewhere in the world. That's a pretty 
optimistic scenario, but I hope that it turns out to be true. 
For 40 years, our foreign policy has been dominated by fear of the Soviet Union 
and the strategy to curb its expansion. Now we are emerging from a bipolar 
world to confront a more complex but encouraging set of relationships. I think 
we are in for a dramatic change in our relationship with the Soviet Union. If 
you look down the long corridors of history, there is no fundamental reason 
that we cannot have better relations. In the '90s, some other power may arise 
as our principal adversary, probably a Pacific power -- China or Japan. 
Gorbachev and the end of the Cold War have changed the scene. While some 
Americans yearn for the simplicity of a bipolar world and urge that we cling to 
an obsolete strategy, we must not yield to nostalgia. Rather we must get about 
the task of developing a new strategy. The United States and Soviet Union are 
certainly not allies and not even friends in the old-fashioned sense. But we 
have passed the point where any Soviet advancement is tantamount to a U.S. 
setback. There may be setbacks, but now, increasingly often, we recognize a 
mutuality of interest in dealing with issues. Both conventional and 
nuclear-arms-control agreements are feasible to a degree previously only 
dreamed about. Clearly, the '90s will see major agreements, both in the nuclear 
and conventional arms fields. 
 In Eastern Europe, we should help each of the nations to achieve emancipation 
without expecting that they will join our bloc. Austria and Finland are 
promising "neutral" models, and we should resist the temptation to achieve the 
moon. We may find that we can work together with the Soviets in addressing such 
regional problems as Angola, Cambodia and Nicaragua. 
As we replace our preoccupation with Soviet containment, we must persuade other 
nationsto do the same. Some of those nations are painfully poor and are focused 
on short-range needs. How do we convince them that they must take steps to 
prevent destruction of the environment through global warming and 
deforestation? How do we compete in a world where we are no longer dominant and 
where threats of protectionism are pervasive? Multilateral diplomacy with all 
its frustrations is the most promising avenue to cope with these cosmic and 
urgent problems. It is a new world -- promising, but full of daunting risks. 
TRENDS: 
Popcorn, born Faith Plotkin, is founder of the Manhattan-based marketing and 
trend analysis firm BrainReserve. She advises corporations about developments 
likely to affect the marketplace. 
WE'RE LOOKING at an era we call the "cleanup decade." We're going to be paying 
back for the sins of the '80s. We're going to have to clean up the economy, the 
ecology, education and ethics. We're glutted out. We've spent too much, 
produced too much garbage and lied too much. There's a relief in the fact that 
it's going to catch up with us. People are going to pare down and become more 
conservative about family stability, value for the dollar and so on. 
The reasons are both economic and emotional. People are sick of the glut and 
the glitz. They want their cars to last 10 years. They want to be in their 
houses for 50 years. They want their kids to grow up straight. They're tired of 
drugs and the threat of drugs. 
The biggest thing will be the consciousness that changes from me to thee. The 
'80s were all about me and what I needed, and money, money, money. The '90s 
will be about children and community and concern for the planet and concern for 
people of China and Russia. Marketing will have to shift to demonstrate an 
ethical stance. One current example is Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream; they have a 
flavor called Amazon Rain Forest Crunch, and proceeds from it go toward 
conservation in South America. 
That's being optimistic, but we're going to have to do with a lot less. There 
is a major gap between the haves and the have-nots, and the haves are going to 
have to start taking care of and responsibility for the have-nots.
