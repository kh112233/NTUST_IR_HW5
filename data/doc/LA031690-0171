50 ILLEGALS SEIZED AT LAX IN THIRD INS SWEEP IN 2 DAYS 
Fifty illegal aliens were detained at Los Angeles International Airport as they 
waited to board flights to other parts of the country in the third big 
immigration sweep at airports in two days, authorities said today. 
Agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service detained the illegal 
aliens late Thursday, said Ben Davidian, INS western regional commissioner. 
Earlier Thursday, immigration agents in Atlanta detained 53 illegal immigrants 
aboard an Eastern Airlines flight. It was the second consecutive day aliens 
were captured while trying to make their way to New York from the West Coast. 
Thursday night, agents swept through terminals at Los Angeles International 
Airport and rounded up 50 suspected illegal aliens by midnight, Davidian said. 
Immigration authorities decided on the Los Angeles sweep after the arrests in 
Atlanta, where suspected illegal aliens were pulled from flights that 
originated in Los Angeles, Davidian said. 
The commissioner said the sweeps, called Operation Red Eye Repeat, were part of 
a continuing operation in response to an increase in smuggling of illegal 
aliens. All major airports have been targeted, including Los Angeles, he said. 
"Los Angeles is a real hub," Davidian said. "This is the main area where 
undocumented aliens want to come because there is so much employment." 
The commissioner said the Los Angeles operation was a "drop in the bucket" 
compared to the 1,500 to 2,000 illegal workers that are picked up in the San 
Diego area every day. 
The 50 suspects detained Thursday night included people from Panama, Pakistan, 
India, Mexico and El Salvador. 
The illegal aliens picked up in Atlanta were the cargo in a massive smuggling 
ring that has been under investigation since last year, the INS said. Most of 
the aliens were going to New York seeking employment, officials said.
