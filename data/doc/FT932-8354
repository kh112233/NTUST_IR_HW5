FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Northern Ireland Electricity makes Pounds
56.6m
NORTHERN Ireland Electricity, the Belfast-based utility which is to be
privatised next month, made an operating profit of Pounds 56.6m on turnover
of Pounds 452.4m in the year to March 31, according to the pathfinder
prospectus issued yesterday.
This compared with Pounds 15m on Pounds 433.5m in 1992 and Pounds 44.1m on
Pounds 403.6m in 1991. But the prospectus warns that comparisons are
misleading because of the restructuring of the Northern Ireland electricity
industry that occurred in 1992.
Restructuring costs also accounted for the low result in 1992.
The bulk of the 1993 result came from the transmission and distribution
business which contributed Pounds 49.3m.
But the company made a Pounds 5.1m loss on its appliance retailing business.
In its latest financial year, NIE paid a total dividend of Pounds 16.5m. The
directors say that they intend to adopt a 'progressive' dividend policy
which, all being well, should produce an increase in real terms.
The pathfinder reveals that the government will be taking Pounds 70m of the
Pounds 85m of cash currently in NIE's balance sheet as repayment for earlier
injections into the company. The government, which will retain a special
non-voting share, will also have the right to half of any capital gains on
asset sales made by the company over a ten-year period.
The NIE issue, which is expected to value the company at between Pounds 300m
and Pounds 400m, will be priced on June 3. Applications for shares must be
in by 10am on June 16.
The basis of allocation will be announced on June 21 and dealings are
expected to commence at the same time.
The government is hoping that up to two thirds of the shares will be bought
by retail investors. People who register by June 1 will be entitled to one
free share for every ten they hold for three years. NIE customers will have
the alternative option of electricity vouchers. Over 600,000 people have
registered so far.
Payment for the shares will be in two instalments, the first on application
and the second on June 28 1994.
NIE is the last of the state-owned non-nuclear electricity companies to be
privatised. Unlike regional companies in England and Wales, it is also in
the transmission business, and it has a different regulator.
