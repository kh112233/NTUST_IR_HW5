FT  02 JUN 93 / International Company News: Elf Sanofi links with US groups
BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb and Sterling Winthrop of the US, together with Elf
Sanofi of France, yesterday announced a preliminary agreement to co-develop
and market two cardiovascular drugs. It allows for the groups to consider
further products for joint development.
The deal, the latest in a series of alliances between drugs groups, is
founded on Bristol-Myers Squibb's expertise in cardiovascular products.
The US group manufactures treatments for hypertension, cholesterol, coronary
heart disease, heart failure and arrhythmias. These include the
ace-inhibitor Capoten, the world's third best-selling medicine with sales of
about Dollars 1.655bn last year, according to UK analysts Wood Mackenzie.
The agreement involves an antithrombotic agent called clopidogrel, developed
by Elf Sanofi and Sterling Winthrop. The two companies formed a strategic
alliance in 1991. Development of the medicine, which is in phase three
trials according to the French company, will be led by the Franco-American
alliance.
The second compound is SR 47436, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist
designed to replace the big-selling ace-inhibitors. Development of the drug,
which is in phase two trials in Europe, will be led by Bristol-Myers.
Under the agreement, once the drugs have been approved, they can be
co-marketed, co-promoted (when the groups market the product under a single
name), or promoted through a joint venture.
Elf Sanofi has concentrated on treatments for cardiovascular disease,
cancer, illnesses related to the central nervous system, and antibiotics.
