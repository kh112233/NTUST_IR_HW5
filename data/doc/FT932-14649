FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: Genentech more than quadruples
net income
GENENTECH, the California-based biotechnology company that was taken over in
1990 by Roche Holdings of Switzerland, yesterday reported an impressive jump
in 1993 first-quarter net income to Dollars 14.3m - more than four times the
level of a year ago.
The profits, which translate into earnings per share of 12 cents against
three cents a year ago, were struck on revenues of Dollars 153m, up from
Dollars 129m in the same quarter of 1992. Higher product sales, royalty
income and contract revenues contributed to the 19 per cent increase in
turnover.
Mr Kirk Raab, president and chief executive, said that while the results
were very good, it was 'even more important' that the company had filed for
approval to market Pulmozyme, a new cystic fibrosis drug, in the US, Europe
and Canada.
Pulmozyme is claimed to reduce the rate of respiratory infection and improve
lung functioning in patients. Mr Raab noted that as recently as five years
ago the drug was merely a 'scientific idea'.
In line with Genentech's heavy investment in research and development,
first-quarter R&amp;D expenses were Dollars 74.2m, up from Dollars 66m in the
first quarter of 1992.
The R&amp;D spending represented 48 per cent of total revenues in the quarter.
Sales of Protropin, a human growth hormone, increased by 8 per cent to
Dollars 52.2m. Sales of Activase t-PA, a heart attack drug, were 11 per cent
higher at Dollars 49.2m.
Genentech also said it had begun Phase II trials of a genetically-engineered
treatment drug for patients infected with the HIV virus.
On Wall Street, where biotechnology stocks have suffered along with other
drugs stocks amid concern about the Clinton administration's plans for
healthcare reform, Genentech's share price declined by Dollars  1/2
yesterday to Dollars 33 5/8 before the close.
