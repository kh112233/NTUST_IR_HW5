FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Japanese drugs groups withstand
price cuts - Pharmaceuticals
Cost-cutting and strong sales of high-margin drugs offset the effects of
weak overall sales growth to support earnings at leading Japanese
pharmaceuticals companies for the first six months to September.
Although average drug prices were marked down by 6.6 per cent across the
industry in April, after the ministry of health and welfare cut prescription
drug prices, there was a sharp rise in sales the same month as customers,
who had held back orders, rushed to take advantage of lower prices.
Profits were further supported by a sharp rise in sales of vitamin drinks,
helped by an unusually hot summer.
Takeda Chemical said healthy sales of vitamin tablets boosted profits.
Profitability at its pharmaceutical division, where sales rose 0.8 per cent,
weakened due to drug price cuts and growing research and development costs.
However, the healthcare products division benefited from strong sales of
vitamin drinks to show a sales rise of 8.8 per cent. For the full year to
next March, the company expects recurring profits to fall 0.2 per cent to
Y77bn (Dollars 793.8m) on a 1.5 per cent rise in sales to Y570bn.
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical saw strong sales of its stomach ulcer remedy
Gastar, although sales of its interferon drug suffered from price cuts. The
company will raise its interim dividend payment to Y8 per share from last
interim's Y6.5. For the full year, it expects sales to rise 2 per cent to
Y265bn on a 0.2 per cent increase in recurring profits to Y54.5bn.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical saw firm drug sales, while profits were supported by
a cut in research and development costs. After-tax profit rose sharply due
to decreased appraisal losses on shares of its subsidiary, and smaller
corporate tax payments. Annual sales are expected to fall 1.2 per cent to
Y232bn, while current profits are expected to rise 10.3 per cent to Y22bn.
Shionogi said a fall in drug sales and interest revenue hurt profitability.
The company suffered an average cut in drug prices of 4.8 per cent, while
sales of its mainstay anti-biotics were weak. For the full year to March,
Shionogi expects a 1.4 per cent drop in sales, to Y227bn, on an 11 per cent
fall in recurring profits to Y20.5bn.
Daiichi Pharmaceutical attributed an earnings rise to strong sales of its
anti-bacterial agents. Cost cutting also helped. The company expects
full-year sales to rise 1.2 per cent to Y210bn and current profits to
increase 0.5 per cent to Y38.5bn.
Sankyo, which will report its earnings today, is expected to see solid
profits growth, attributable to strong sales of its anti-cholesterol drug.
However, revenues are expected to have suffered because of decreased sales
of drugs made by Sandoz, the Swiss drug company.
