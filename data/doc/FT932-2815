FT  17 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour MPs turn down vote change
LABOUR MPs yesterday rejected proposals to reform the system for electing
party's chief whip. A meeting of the parliamentary party voted to keep
separate elections for the chief whip and his deputy.
The PLP backed a proposal to increase from three to four the number of women
that Labour MPs must vote for in shadow cabinet elections.
