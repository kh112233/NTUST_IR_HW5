  [Text] Palermo, Italy, Jan 21 (AFP) -- A court here Friday 
[21 January] jailed 13 heroin traffickers, including a suspected 
mafia chief on the run, who was given 20 years, a judicial 
official said. 
  The smuggling ring sending heroin to the United States was 
allegedly headed by Pietro Aglieri, who was named by a mafia 
turncoat and is considered one of the new heads of organised 
crime in Sicily. 
  As well as receiving a 20-year sentence, Aglieri was fined 
150 million lire (90,000 dollars). 
  Salvatore Cancemi, a former mafioso who betrayed the ring, 
escaped with seven years and a 40 million lire fine. 
  In a separate hearing, the court imposed a 15-year sentence 
on American mafia boss John Gambino, which the official said was 
negotiated in New York in return for his collaboration. 
  Cancemi admitted running a heroin refinery at Caccamo, 40 
kilometres (25 miles) from Palermo, producing drugs which Toto 
Riina, a top mafia leader currently on trial, allegedly exported 
to the United States. 
  Francesco Marina Mannoia, another turncoat who alleged links 
between the mafia and former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, 
also worked in the refinery.
