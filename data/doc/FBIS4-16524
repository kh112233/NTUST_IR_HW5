  [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Albi Shudrya, senior 
officer of the Ukrainian Naval Forces press center, told a UNIAN 
correspondent on 15 April that 42 naval officers and warrant 
officers of the former 318th division of the Black Sea Fleet 
conservation ships have by now taken the oath of allegiance to 
the people of Ukraine and got down to fulfilling their duties 
within the composition of the first brigade protecting the 
Odessa naval district. Out of the 136 families of servicemen, 
only eight decided to leave Odessa for the deployment sites of 
the Russian military units. "Those who expressed their wish to 
leave Odessa were yesterday offered to travel and transfer their 
luggage in separate births of the Slavutych ship," said Vice 
Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, the Ukrainian Naval Forces 
commander, during his conversation with the UNIAN correspondent. 
"However, these servicemen and their families did not wish to 
leave Odessa on board the Ukrainian ship. They were offered a 
cargo airplane AN-12, which will fly off for the town of Saki on 
21 April, as agreed with the Russian servicemen." 
  Replying to a question on who the property of the Ukrainian 
Naval Forces, stolen from Odessa, was passed to, the vice 
admiral pointed out: "After the crew of the Cheleken had 
carried out the pirate voyage, the vessel, escorted by ships 
with marines on board, at first dropped its anchor in the area 
where the cargo could be inspected. However, the Black Sea 
Fleet command did not allow representatives of the procurator's 
office, customs, and border guards to board the Cheleken. On 
the next day, the vessel was stationed near other ships in a 
zone closed for any kind of inspections. On the third day, when 
only 15 pieces of cargo remained on board the Cheleken out of 
the 41 that had been taken away, the inspectors had nothing else 
to do but state that the criminal operation was a success.
