ARTIST PLEADS INNOCENT TO MASS FORGERY 
Anthony Gene Tetro, described by prosecutors as one of the nation's most 
prolific art forgers, pleaded innocent today to copying the works of artists 
such as Chagall, Miro and Rockwell. 
Tetro, 40, indicted on 44 counts of felony forgery, entered his plea before 
Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner, who assigned a public defender to represent 
him and set a pretrial hearing for July 19. 
At a preliminary hearing in March, Mark Henry Sawicki, a former associate of 
Tetro, testified that he did $75,000 to $100,000 worth of business a year with 
Tetro between 1984 and 1989. Sawicki said he sold hundreds of works attributed 
to such artists as Joan Miro, Salvador Dali, Norman Rockwell and Hiro Yamagata. 
Sawicki, who was charged with selling forged art last year, agreed to be wired 
with a tape recorder and, according to authorities, recorded a conversation in 
which Tetro is heard to say he "did a Chagall" and had other fake Chagalls "in 
the works." 
Sawicki said Tetro would practice the signatures of the artists he was copying. 
"He would practice on note pads, scratch paper, sometimes even on the backs of 
damaged artworks," Sawicki said at the preliminary hearing. 
Sawicki, former owner of a Sherman Oaks gallery called Visual Environments, and 
Tetro are among several art dealers local and federal authorities have 
implicated in a multimillion-dollar art fraud investigation.
