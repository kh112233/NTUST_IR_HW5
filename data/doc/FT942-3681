FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Dissatisfied voters send a clear
signal - Greece
So confident was Mr Andreas Papandreou, the elderly Greek prime minister, of
victory for his Panhellenic Socialist Movement that he went to bed without
bothering to watch the results of Sunday's European Parliament elections on
television.
It was left to his spokesman to explain in the early hours why support for
Pasok had dropped by 10 percentage points since its triumphant return to
power in last October's general election.
While the Socialists easily headed the poll, capturing 37.6 per cent to 32.7
per cent for the conservative New Democracy, Greek voters had clearly
registered dissatisfaction with both big parties.
Pasok won 10 of Greece's 25 seats in the European parliament, against eight
for New Democracy, three for the nationalist Political Spring party, and two
each for the Greek Communist party and the Left Alliance.
Analysts said the results reflected widespread disappointment with the
government's unwillingness during the past eight months to grant generous
wage and pension increases and create public sector jobs for Pasok
supporters. While several thousand appointments have been made, the rising
public sector deficit inhibits the Socialists from setting up dozens of new
state enterprises as they did in the 1980s.
However, voters also signalled their concern about Pasok's future, following
repeated hints that Mr Papandreou, who is 75 and has a heart problem, may
resign as Pasok's leader and seek election next year for the ceremonial job
of president. Without the charismatic but authoritarian Mr Papandreou in
charge, Pasok's rival factions could be plunged into a messy struggle for
power.
New Democracy is embroiled in such a battle, as Mr Miltiades Evert, who took
over as leader after last year's election, tries to gain control. The
party's poor showing on Sunday is already provoking fresh criticism of his
failure to improve the conservatives' image.
The election results also underline the possibility of splinter groups
breaking away from both parties, headed by prominent personalities unwilling
to serve under an unpopular leader. Mr Evert's old-fashioned insistence on
state-oriented economic policies is trying the patience of reform-minded
conservatives. Another hammering in local government elections later this
year would speed their departure to form a new party.
The biggest gains on Sunday were made by Political Spring, the nationalist
party led by Mr Antonis Samaras, a former foreign minister who brought the
conservative government down last year by persuading several ND deputies to
defect. With 8.7 per cent of the vote, almost double its share in the
general election, Political Spring's efforts to attract voters in their 20s
and 30s appear to have paid off.
Yet the strength of the protest vote also propelled both the Greek
communists, still unswervingly Stalinist, and the small Left Alliance party
back into the European parliament, with 6.3 and 6.2 per cent of the vote
respectively. Record numbers of votes also went to fringe parties with no
hope of winning seats, among them environmental groups, rightwing extremists
and the newly formed Leftwing Resistance to the European Union.
