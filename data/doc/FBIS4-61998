  [Text] Tallinn, May 11, BNS -- British Prime Minister John 
Major in a letter to his Estonian counterpart Mart Laar 
expressed Britain's support for the integration of Estonia with 
European structures and for the demand that Russian troops be 
pulled out from this Baltic country by Aug. 31, 1994, government 
spokesman Ain Saarna said. 
  The letter was delivered to Laar in London, where the 
Estonian leader is currently staying for an official visit. 
  Major in the message also says he is convinced that the 
visit 
by the Estonian prime minister contributes to the development of 
good and friendly relations between Estonia and Great Britain. 
The British premier separately mentions the economic agreements 
to be signed Thursday [12 May]. 
  Major expressed regret at not being able to meet Laar 
because 
of urgent business. 
  The Estonian prime minister today visited the CEETEX '94 
East 
European technologies and investment fair. He was scheduled to 
meet British Minister of State Douglas Hogg later in the day. 
The timetable of the visit includes a trip to Oxford in the 
evening, where Laar holds a lecture, titled "From 
Totalitarianism to Democracy." 
  On Thursday, Laar and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd sign 
two 
intergovernmental agreements in the field of the economy. 
  The president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, Jacques de Larosiere, will host a luncheon in honor 
of the Estonian leader. Laar will also have meetings with 
representatives of the British Industrial Confederation. 
  The prime minister is scheduled to return to Tallinn late on 
Thursday. Justice Minister Kaido Kama stands in during Laar's 
visit as the head of the Cabinet.
