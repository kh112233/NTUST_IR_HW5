FT  11 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Romania investment growth tops league
THE NUMBER of foreign investment projects in eastern and central Europe has
continued to grow rapidly this year, though many involve a relatively small
injection of overseas capital, according to the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe.
New foreign investment registrations in the former Comecon countries of
Europe totalled more than 7,000 in the first quarter of 1993, bringing the
overall number to 72,300. This compares with just over 31,000 registrations
at the beginning of 1992.
The ECE's latest round-up* shows growth was most rapid in Romania, where
23,500 foreign investment projects were registered at the end of March 1993.
Romania now has the largest number of enterprises with overseas
participation in the region. However, most have a very small foreign capital
component and 'appear to have been encouraged by the provision of special
tax concessions by the government'.
Registrations of joint ventures and foreign subsidiaries in Hungary totalled
over 14,000 at the end of March. In Poland, about 10,000 foreign investment
projects were registered by then.
The ECE also notes a surge of interest by foreign companies in the Baltic
states, with the number of foreign investment projects rising to 4,000 in
Estonia, 2,800 in Latvia and 2,300 in Lithuania. Here too, however, the
amount of overseas capital involved is small. In members of the Commonwealth
of Independent States, foreign investment registrations rose from 7,000 to
8,000 in the first quarter this year, compared with 2,600 at the beginning
of 1992.
