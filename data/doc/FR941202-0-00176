<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Office of Personnel Management is issuing final regulations on the use and recredit of sick leave for Federal employees.
Consistent with the recently enacted Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act, the final regulations expand
the use of sick leave by permitting most employees to use a total of up to 104 hours of sick leave each leave year (or, in
the case of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, the number of hours of sick leave normally
accrued during a leave year) to provide care for a family member as a result of physical or mental illness; injury; pregnancy;
childbirth; or medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment; or to make arrangements necessitated by the
death of a family member or attend the funeral of a family member. The final regulations also remove the 3-year break-in-service
limitation on the recredit of sick leave for former employees who are reemployed on or after December 2, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24560), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published proposed regulations to amend 5 CFR
630.401 to provide that employees may use a total of up to 5 days of sick leave per leave year to provide care for a child,
spouse, or parent as a result of sickness, injury, pregnancy, or childbirth; to make arrangements necessitated by
the death of a family member; or to attend the funeral of a family member. In addition, OPM proposed to amend 5 CFR 630.502
and 630.504 to remove the 3-year brake-in-service limitation on the recredit of sick leave and permit employees who
separate from Federal service to have their unused sick leave recredited in full to their sick leave accounts upon
return to Federal service on or after the effective date of the final regulations. These changes were recommended
in the Report of the National Performance Review on September 7, 1993. The proposed regulations also included conforming
changes in 630.402 (Application for sick leave), 630.403 (Supporting evidence), and 630.405 (Use
of sick leave during annual leave).


During the comment period, OPM received comments from 1 Member of Congress, 29 Federal agencies, 1 labor organization,
13 professional organizations and associations, and 99 individuals, for a total of 143 comments. Thirty-four commenters
supported the proposed revisions in the sick leave regulations without change. Five individuals opposed the proposed
sick leave regulations. These individuals believed sick leave should be granted only for an employee's personal
illness or injury and that Federal employees earn and accrue sufficient annual leave to provide care for family members.
After the close of the comment period, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Federal Employees Family
Friendly Leave Act, Public Law 103388, on October 22, 1994. The Act authorizes the use by all covered full-time
employees of a total of up to 40 hours (5 workdays) of sick leave per year to (1) give care or otherwise attend to a family
member having an illness, injury, or other condition which, if an employee had such a condition, would justify the
use of sick leave by the employee; or (2) make arrangements or attend the funeral of a family member. In addition, a covered
full-time employee who maintains a balance of at least 80 hours of sick leave may use an additional 64 hours (8 workdays)
of sick leave per year for these purposes, bringing the total amount of sick leave available for family care and bereavement
purposes to a maximum of 104 hours (13 workdays) per year for employees who satisfy this condition.
The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act will become effective on December 22, 1994. As discussed below, however,
we have determined that regulatory provisions consistent with the entitlements provided by this legislation should
be made effective immediately under the regulatory authority granted to OPM by the current sick leave statute (5 U.S.C.
6311).
