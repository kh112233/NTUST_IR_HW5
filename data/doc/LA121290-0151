GOTTI INDICTMENT ALLEGES MURDER 
John Gotti, the "Teflon Don" mob boss whom authorities can't seem to convict, 
was indicted today on charges of ordering the slaying of Gambino crime family 
chief Paul Castellano and three other killings. 
Castellano's slaying catapulted Gotti to power in 1985. 
The indictment also charged Gotti with loansharking, gambling, tax evasion and 
obstruction of justice. 
The dapper Gotti, 50, as usual impeccably dressed, was arrested Tuesday night 
with three associates at a social club in Manhattan's Little Italy. 
"It's the first time we've taken down the entire hierarchy of an organized 
crime family," said James Fox, head of the FBI office in New York.
