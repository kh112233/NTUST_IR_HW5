KIN MAY REMOVE FOOD TUBES, SAYS TOP FLORIDA COURT 
The Florida Supreme Court ruled Thursday that relatives or guardians can order 
the removal of feeding tubes that keep brain-damaged people alive, even if the 
patients have not signed "living wills." 
The justices said the guardians do not need a court's approval in each 
individual case. 
However, the patient must have expressed, at least verbally, a preference for 
dying rather than being kept alive with feeding tubes. 
The foundation of the "right-to-die" decision, which came in the case of an 
89-year-old woman who died last summer, is the right to privacy in the state 
constitution. 
"This case resolves a question of an individual's constitutional right of 
self-determination," Justice Rosemary Barkett wrote in the majority opinion. 
The woman at the center of the case, Estelle Browning, spent the last 2 1/2 
years of her life hooked up to feeding tubes that she had earlier, in a "living 
will," said she did not want. 
She suffered permanent brain damage in a stroke and was left in a vegetative 
state, unable to swallow or communicate. She was not comatose. Doris Herbert, 
Browning's second cousin and only living relative, was named her guardian. 
Herbert sought permission to remove the tubes in 1988. The state fought the 
request and a trial court denied it. But a state appeals court said the state's 
constitution allowed it, and the issue was reviewed by the Supreme Court.
