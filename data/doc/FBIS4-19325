  [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel 
(Free Democratic Party of Germany) fears consequences for 
Germany's foreign policy if the assertion is true that the 
Turkish military is using German weapons against the Kurds. 
  In the Frankfurt talks of Hesse radio, Kinkel stated today 
that the information and documents provided by human rights 
groups are being evaluated. Everything suggests that it will 
again be difficult to prove the allegations. Examinations in 
the past also failed to furnish evidence that the Turks are 
using the weapons against the Kurds. Nothing is being covered 
up in this respect. If the allegations should turn out to be 
true, this "would not be good for German-Turkish relations," 
Kinkel stressed.
