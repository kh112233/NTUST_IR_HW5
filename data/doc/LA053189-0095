THE WORLD 
A furor over a media leak of the Canadian budget widened as journalists and 
opposition parties expressed outrage that a reporter has been accused in the 
affair. Television journalist Doug Small was formally charged with possession 
of stolen budget documents. Small, who said he obtained the documents from a 
source after a clandestine meeting at an Ottawa gas station, broadcast details 
of the budget on the evening before it was to be presented to Parliament. Four 
others were also charged.
