    [Editorial Report] The 8 May Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA 
in Malay on page 6 reported that Malaysia and the Philippines 
plan to legalize cross-border entry in an effort to reduce the 
influx of illegal aliens, which has strained relations between 
the two countries. During a meeting in Manila, the Joint 
Committee on Border Cooperation also discussed measures to 
combat piracy, smuggling, hijacking, and drug trafficking 
activities, and to ease the entry of goods. Although details of 
the proposed legalization as well as other guidelines are still 
to be finalized during another meeting later this year in Kuala 
Lumpur, both sides hope that an agreement can be implemented by 
January 1995. Estimates put the number of illegal Filipinos in 
Malaysia at about 1 million. Most of the illegal aliens are 
concentrated in the state of Sabah, a few hours away by boat 
from the Philippines' southern island of Mindanao.
