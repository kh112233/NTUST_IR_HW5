FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (6): Fifth reactor planned - Nuclear
Energy
A GOVERNMENT decision is imminent on whether Finland is going to have a
fifth 1000MW nuclear power station to meet its future energy needs.
Most of the signs suggest that the politicians will bow to the demands of
the country's main energy intensive export industries, most notably
forestry, and recommend the go-ahead. A final decision will rest with
parliament, but Finland's anti-nuclear movement may find it difficult in
present circumstances to mount an effective campaign against a proposal to
build a fifth reactor.
The power companies submitted an application for a decision in principle for
a new nuclear facility in May 1991 and it has led to some serious divisions
inside the cabinet of the centre-right government. If the green light is
given, the new nuclear station could begin production by the end of the
century.
An added complication to the energy debate in Finland is the on-and-off
discussion over the proposed pipeline to bring natural gas from the Norway's
Haltenbanken field in the North Sea, with its known 300bn cubic metres of
reserves, across Sweden and under the Gulf of Bothnia to Finland. The
pipeline, which could be built by the Neste company by 1998, is seen by some
observers as an alternative to a fifth nuclear power plant but this looks
unlikely. For its part, Neste says it is complementary to the nuclear
decision.
For Finland's export industries the crucial factor in energy supply is
price. At present, they enjoy some of the cheapest industrial energy prices
in the world, due largely to the nuclear power component. If they became
more dependent on imported coal or natural gas - neither of which exists in
Finland - their energy costs would rise.
There is also talk of using biomass - organic waste products - as an
alternative fuel source. But few observers believe that this technology
could compete commercially with nuclear energy. Finland may have abundant
supplies of wood chips, bark and wastewood to burn, currently producing
about 15 to 16 per cent of total energy needs. But this appears to be the
commercial limit for this form of fuel, particularly if an upturn in the
forestry industry increased demand for wood.
Imatran Voima (IVO), the Finnish power generating company, makes no secret
of its own preference. It wants parliament to approve the fifth nuclear
reactor. Indeed, IVO has already drawn up a short list of six different
choices of reactor. The company has no wish to delay making its choice once
it has the opportunity to push ahead. It runs already the two Soviet built
445MW pressurised water reactors at Loviisa which were established in May
1977 and January 198I.
IVO is a state-owned company which is Finland's largest supplier and seller
of wholesale electricity. It is also the country's leading producer of
electricity as well as being the second largest producer of district heat.
Last year its power generation totalled 12.313bn GWh, with just over half
that coming from nuclear power followed by coal, peat, hydropower, natural
gas, oil and industrial waste and 0.16 GWh from wind power.
The company does not confine its business activities to Finland. It runs an
international subsidiary which was responsible for an estimated 660 projects
and assignments in 24 countries last year. IVO is involved in a number of
operations in the Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania as well as Abu Dhabi and Nepal.
It has recently constructed a factory to manufacture district heating pipes
in St Petersburg.
Earlier this year, IVO teamed up with Jaakko Poyry Oy, the Finnish forestry
consulting and engineering company, in the creation of an organisation
called the Energy Consultation Group with the objective of improving energy
efficiency in areas of Russia neighbouring the Finnish border.
The two companies, which together employ 3,000 engineers familiar with the
Russian energy sector, are in a good position to provide the necessary
know-how for a substantial improvement in heating and energy conservation
projects in Russia. The trouble, however, is the financing of such schemes
and private companies are looking to the Finnish government to back what
they want to do.
There is little doubting the concern among ministers about the safety of
Russia's nuclear power stations close to Finland's eastern border. Earlier
this year, the government earmarked FM6.4m for co-operation with Russia on
nuclear safety on the Kola peninsula, where there are four 440MW light-water
reactors of the VVER type, and at the Sosnovy Bor power station in St
Petersburg which includes 1,000MW graphite-moderated reactors of the RBMK
type, similar to the one at Chernobyl.
