 

Section 15.41General Application Procedures



Pursuant to Section 107 of the WBCA, any person may submit a petition to the Director to determine whether a foreign
exotic bird breeding facility shall be designated as a qualifying facility. If a foreign facility is approved as a
qualifying facility, species of exotic birds for which the facility is approved can be imported into the United States
from that facility without import permits issued pursuant to subpart C of this part 15. In all cases, any additional
requirements in 50 CFR parts 13, 14, 17, 21, and 23 must also be met. Applications for approval shall be submitted to
the Service's Office of Management Authority. A separate application must be submitted for each species for which
approval is requested. 

Applications must contain information as required in paragraph (c) of this section, in order to make a series of findings
required by the WBCA. The Service notes that the fundamental purposes of these findings is to ensure that the birds
exported from these facilities are indeed bred in captivity, no illegal trade is involved, and wild populations are
not harmed by either the breeding program or export from these facilities. The information required includes but
is not limited to the following: (1) Certification from the Management Authority of the country in which the facility
is located that the facility is capable of breeding the species in the numbers to be traded, without detriment to the
wild population of the species; (2) A summary of the legislation, and regulations where appropriate, implementing
the Convention in the country in which the facility is located; (3) A detailed statement of the facility's capability
of breeding the species in captivity in the numbers desired, including breeding methods, experience, and production
levels; (4) A detailed statement demonstrating that the facility is operated in a manner not detrimental to the survival
of the species, including details on the establishment of the parental stock; (5) A statement of any anticipated need
for augmentation of breeding stock from other sources; (6) A detailed statement demonstrating that the facility
is operated in a humane and healthful manner; (7) A description of the care and maintenance practices of the facility,
including mortality and disease records and husbandry, veterinary, and hygienic practices; (8) A statement that
all birds to be exported from the facility will be marked with closed leg bands or an electronic marking system; and
(9) Details on the system of recordkeeping and tracking of birds and their progeny hatched at the facility would be
required. 



Section 15.42Approval Criteria and Conditions



This section would establish the criteria for approval of foreign captive-breeding facilities by the Director,
and approval conditions and duration. The approval conditions would include: (1) Whether the facility is located
in a country that is Party to the Convention and is implementing the requirements of the Convention, including designation
of functioning Scientific and Management Authorities, submission of annual reports, and establishment of implementing
legislation; (2) Whether the facility is capable of producing captive-bred birds in the numbers to be exported; (3)
Whether the parental breeding stock was acquired from legally obtained, exported, and/or imported birds; (4) Whether
the facility is operated in a manner not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild; (5) Whether adequate
enforcement controls are in place; (6) Whether the breeding protocol of the facility is adequate; (7) Whether the
facility is operated in a humane and healthful manner; (8) Whether the facility will provide for proper and healthful
care and maintenance of the birds; and (9) Whether all birds are identifiable through closed leg bands or electronic
marking. The Service welcomes comments on these criteria, including those related to the applicability of relevant
international law. 

The approval conditions established in this section require the submission of an annual report to the Service containing
production and mortality records, including hatching records, numbers of birds exported, and their identification
numbers. As established in the WBCA, approvals are to be effective for three years, provided that the facility continues
to meet the requirements and approval conditions. Each application submitted for approval is proposed to be published
in the 

Federal Register

 for public comment, and the Service will periodically publish in the 

Federal Register

 a list of all approved foreign breeding facilities and the effective dates of their approval. 



Public Comments Solicited 



The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, any comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific
or conservation communities, trade organizations, or any other interested party concerning any aspect of this proposal
are hereby solicited.
