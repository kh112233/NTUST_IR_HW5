  [Text] Cairo, March 4 (AFP)--Egypt's outlawed Islamic Group 
said Friday it had carried out three attacks in the past week to 
avenge the Hebron massacre of more than 50 Muslim worshipers by 
a Jewish settler. 
  The Islamic Group, known in Arabic as al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah, claimed responsibility for two attacks on banks 
and the murder of a police officer, according to a statement 
sent to AFP. 
  "These operations are part of the escalation we decided on 
to 
avenge the martyrs of Abraham Mosque" in Hebron, the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a Jewish settler shot dead 52 
Palestinian worshippers last Friday, it said. 
  The statement claimed responsibility for the late Thursday 
explosion at the Egyptian-American Bank in Cairo, as well as an 
attack on Tuesday against Misr Bank in Abu Tij and the killing 
of a police officer in Badari. 
  Both Abu Tij and Badari are in the southern region of Asyut, 
a Muslim militant stronghold. 
  The group said it carried out the attacks after the banks 
closed "in order not to endanger human lives." 
  It renewed its February 8 call to tourists and foreign 
investors to leave Egypt and to Egyptian bank customers to close 
their accounts. "If these (attacks) are not enough for you, 
there will be others," it said. 
  Since the warning there have been six attacks against banks 
-- five in Cairo and one in Asyut -- but there have been no 
casualties.
