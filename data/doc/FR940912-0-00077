for the D.C. Circuit ordered EPA on August 24, 1994, to stay the effectiveness of those revocations. By this document,
EPA is implementing the Court's order by reinstating the food additive regulations for benomyl and trifluralin pending
judicial review of EPA's June 1994 Order by that Court.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33684) (``June 1994 Order''), EPA issued a final judicially reviewable rule revoking the food
additive regulations for benomyl (processed tomato products and raisins), trifluralin (peppermint and spearmint
oil), mancozeb (bran of wheat), and phosmet (cottonseed oil). On July 14, 1994, the registrants for benomyl and trifluralin
filed a petition for review of EPA's June 1994 Order with the Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. In addition,
DuPont and DowElanco filed with the Court a ``Motion for Summary Reversal, or in the Alternative, Stay Pending Review.''
On August 24, 1994, the Court denied Petitioners' Motion for a Summary Reversal, but granted the Motion for a Stay Pending
Judicial Review. 


By this document, EPA is implementing the Court's Order granting a stay by reinstating the benomyl (processed tomato
products and raisins) and trifluralin (peppermint and spearmint oil) food additive regulations pending judicial
review of EPA's decision. These regulations, therefore, will remain in place until the stay is terminated, EPA is
otherwise ordered by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals or another court, or EPA takes further administrative action.
EPA is not reinstating the food additive regulations for mancozeb (bran of wheat) and phosmet (cottonseed oil) because
they were not the subject of the Court's August 24, 1994 decision. Therefore, those regulations continue to be revoked.
Until otherwise acted upon by EPA, the Code of Federal Regulations text will continue to include the full text of the
food additive regulations for benomyl and trifluralin (40 CFR 185.350 and 185.5900).
