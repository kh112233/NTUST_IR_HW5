  [Text] The situation in the city of Kuito is worrisome 
since the Black Cockerel troops, who have failed to take over 
the city, are now bent on transforming the city into dust 
through intense shellings into Kuito and outlying wards over the 
last 72 hours. Meanwhile, the number of victims of the shootings 
and shellings is still rising and it is estimated that more than 
500 civilians died and 800 others were wounded since 26 May. 
There is an increased number of people facing malnutrition due 
to food shortages.
