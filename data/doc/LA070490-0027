CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
PANEL BACKS CHANGE IN ADOPTION RECORDS 
The state Senate's Judiciary Committee approved a bill that would strip the 
confidentiality from California adoption records, revealing the identity of 
thousands of parents who relinquished their children before 1984. The bill, 
passed on a bipartisan 6-0 vote, would make original birth certificates and 
court records open to the inspection of adoptees and their adoptive parents and 
require the state Department of Social Services to release information on the 
marriages and married names of the birth parents. 
Birth parents would gain access to the amended birth certificate and other 
records showing the names and addresses of the adoptive parents. The records 
would only be available after the adoptees reached age 18. The bill includes a 
provision requiring the state to conduct a yearlong advertising campaign 
warning birth parents and adoptees to contact the state if they want to shield 
their identity.
