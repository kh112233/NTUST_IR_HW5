  [Text] Beijing, April 4 (AFP)--Hong Kong journalist Xi 
Yang has been sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for spying and 
stealing state secrets, a spokeswoman for the Beijing 
Intermediate Court said Monday [4 April]. "Xi Yang was 
sentenced on March 28 to 12 years imprisonment and deprived of 
political rights for two years," the spokeswoman said, adding 
that Xi had already lodged an appeal with the Beijing Higher 
People's Court. 
  A mainland-born journalist working for the Chinese-language 
MING PAO DAILY NEWS, Xi was detained in September and charged 
with "espionage regarding state secrets on banking." Xi had 
worked here for the semi-official CHINA NEWS SERVICE before 
moving to Hong Kong two years ago. He is a Chinese national and 
subject to Chinese laws. 
  Formally announcing his arrest on October 7, state-run 
television said an employee of the central People's Bank of 
China, identified as Tian Ye, had supplied Xi with a "large 
quantity" of secret financial information, including unpublished 
policy decisions on bank rates and international gold trading.
