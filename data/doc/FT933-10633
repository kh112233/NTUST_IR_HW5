FT  03 AUG 93 / PowerGen wins right to burn 'dirty fuel'
BRITAIN'S pollution authorities have given permission for two power stations
to burn orimulsion, a mixture of bitumen and water which has been denounced
by environmentalists as 'the world's filthiest fuel'.
The Pollution Inspectorate has issued authorisations to PowerGen, the UK's
second largest private sector power generator, for its stations at Ince on
Merseyside and Richborough near Sandwich in Kent.
Both stations have been burning the fuel on an experimental basis for three
years to enable emissions tests to be made. But the authorisations, issued
last Friday, mean orimulsion is now officially deemed to be environmentally
acceptable.
The authorisations carry a number of conditions. PowerGen must closely
monitor and report its emissions. It must also draw up a plan to install
equipment at both power stations to clean up exhaust gases, although this
does not need to be in operation until April 1998. The inspectorate has also
set emission limits which should prevent the stations being run at full
capacity.
Orimulsion is a proprietary product made in Venezuela and imported into the
UK by a company jointly owned by Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil
company, and British Petroleum. It is cheaper than oil or gas, but its
controversial environmental reputation - it has been accused of causing acid
rain - has prevented widespread use.
The UK pollution authorities have decided, however, that orimulsion is no
dirtier overall than other fuels, and can be burnt without jeopardising the
commitment to reduce acid rain and prevent global warming.
The authorisations will anger the environmental lobby, but also come at a
sensitive time for the coal industry.
