Academy of Sciences: "Structural Crisis In Estonia's Industry"] 
  [Text] 
  The structure of the industry that had (been) developed 
by the year of 1989 did not correspond to the needs of Estonia 
after it had regained its independence. The central authority of 
the Soviet Union had, in all possible ways, reduced the 
importance of the union republic as a whole. Through trade 
ministry control, specialization to the point of absurdity, 
extending contacts for cooperation, location of production, 
acquisition of raw materials, and other such measures, all were 
made dependent on everyone else. 
  This meant dismantling most of the previously existing 
structures, and interrupting the natural self-regulation of the 
economy. In essence, Estonian industry was nothing more than a 
collection of enterprises located within its territory. 
  Thanks to the very large market of the Soviet Union, as a 
relatively closed system, its enormous natural resources, and 
its deficit economy, the industry did not have to contend with 
world competition. And thanks to a price structure that was 
absurd, artificial, and radically different from the rest of the 
world (unjustifiably low prices of energy carriers, raw 
materials, etc.), a predominantly resource- energy- and 
transport-intensive industry was created, that produced 
primarily low-quality goods. 
  As a prerequisite for reaching a realistic level of 
political 
and economic independence, Estonia saw the need for considerably 
reducing its economic dependence on Russia, and for reorienting 
itself to the Western market. Actually, these steps were as 
inevitable as they were necessary. There was no choice in the 
matter. The Eastern market had, by that time, become less 
important and less secure. 
  Industrial enterprises that had previously produced goods 
for 
the Eastern market, according to plans approved in Moscow, were 
now caught up in entirely new circumstances. When previously, 
industrial management teams only had production, technical and 
supply problems to cope with, then now the basic question was: 
What should be produced and for what market? 
  Many clear thinking economists and industrial leaders 
realized that--as sad as it may be--there is no way of reforming 
the industry smoothly and painlessly. Instead, they conceded, 
the existing industry may collapse, and a new one emerge in its 
place. 
  And that is what happened. Back in 1990 and 1991, production 
volumes dropped considerably, and in 1992, the real structural 
crisis started. I want to emphasize, once again, that this was a 
completely logical development. All the post-socialist countries 
have experienced a decline in production, none of them have been 
able to avoid it.

<H5>  All Governments Have Been Getting Involved </H5>
  Perceiving and understanding the underlying laws of economic 
and social development, does not necessarily mean that the 
government, industrial leaders and economists rely on 
self-regulation, follow the development of the industry 
passively, and let things take their course. 
  Quite to the contrary. All governments have been rather 
active in getting involved in the industry of the transition 
period. Maybe even too active, for the taste of some political 
forces and economists. 
  The structural crisis of the industry is continuing during 
1993. The production volume for the first nine months of the 
year (at comparable prices) was down by 32.4 percent, compared 
to the same period last year. September's volume of industrial 
production (at comparable prices) was down 19.2 percent, 
compared to September of last year. 
  The decline of industry has been enormous, of course. The 
output of many of the products has been reduced several times, 
while production of some goods has stopped entirely. The 
problems are many, of course, but there is no need to 
over-dramatize the situation. Starting with March of 1992, one 
can see that the industry is beginning to stabilize. 
Stabilization, in this case, does not mean restoring the 
previous production levels aimed at the Eastern market, but 
stopping the decline in production and finding (or formulating) 
an industrial structure appropriate for Estonia. 
<H5>  Industrial Production Growing </H5>
  Since March of this year (except for the massive vacation 
months of July and August), industrial production at comparable 
prices has been growing. During the first eight months, proceeds 
from corporate income tax amounted to 93.2 percent of the 
budgeted total for 1993. This not only points to increased 
economic activity, but also to the fact that the economy is 
picking up faster than was expected at the time the budget was 
approved. 
  Estonia's economy has been able to reorient itself to the 
Western market. When, in 1989, close to 97 percent of the trade 
was done with the Soviet republics then, by the middle of 1993, 
the share of CIS republics, in both imports and exports, had 
dwindled to 27 percent. In August of 1993, the CIS share of the 
total foreign trade volume (exports and imports combined) was 
23.9 percent. From that we can conclude that Estonia's 
dependence on the Eastern market has dropped below the level 
maintained by Finland during its record years (26 percent). 
  Thanks to the monetary reform, balanced budget, and 
following 
the recommendations of IMF, Estonia has, within a short period 
of time, become a country worthy of investments, and has indeed 
attracted considerable amounts of foreign capital. 
<H5>  Bankruptcies Are Inevitable </H5>
  There are many small businesses developing fast. As of 
October 15, 1993, a total of 7,434 companies were registered 
under Estonia's processing industry. Out of that number, roughly 
4,000 are actually operating, half of them with 20 or more 
employees. Even that is not a small number, compared to earlier 
counts. 
  One fifth out of roughly 300 big enterprises have also 
managed to find their place under new economic and political 
circumstances. They have not reduced their production, compared 
to last year's. It is hoped that most of the companies still 
struggling with hardship will soon find their place in the new 
economic system--many of them after privatization. Some 
industrial enterprises, however, will inevitably go bankrupt. 
They will be either liquidated, refinanced, or reorganized. It 
would be impossible to save all of the production facilities 
that were put up at one time to encourage migration, supply the 
Eastern market, or simply to the greater glory of the system, 
even with the best of intentions and the most ingenious of 
industrial policies. 
  Comparing Estonia's 'economic miracle' to that of other 
post-socialist countries, one can say that Estonia's industry 
came through this confusing time and situation with sustainable 
losses. The IMF, the World Bank, EBRD, government leaders of 
other states, and known economists speak of the success of our 
current reforms, setting them up as models for the other states. 
Western diplomats and journalists have been using the term 
'Estonia's economic miracle' with increasing frequency. It is 
most rewarding to hear all that. At the same time we know that 
there are still many problems yet to be solved, and in many of 
the sectors production is declining to this day. Of particular 
concern is the politically over-heated Northeast Estonia, that 
is of no interest to foreign investors, and where it is hard to 
develop private enterprise. Development, here, is hampered by 
lack of capital and by incomplete legislation. 
<H5>  Ownership Issue Is Key Problem </H5>
  If we had not made so many mistakes, hesitated, dawdled, and 
lost time, we would have been further along by now. But the 
breakthrough has already taken place. Development has become 
irreversible. The structure of the industry has already changed 
to some extent, and conditions have been created for further 
development. As things stand now, not only are the old jobs 
disappearing, but new ones are sprouting up in their place. 
  Estonia's strategic goal can only be the creation of a 
industry capable of export, and joining the European Community 
(the first stage obviously being a free trade agreement). State 
allocations for structural policies to implement these goals are 
very limited. This is why it was decided to privatize most of 
the work. Everything that can be done using private capital, 
should be done using private capital. 
  A sensible and, if possible, rapid solution of ownership 
issues is at the heart of industrial development. Once this 
problem is solved successfully, conditions will be created for 
solving all other problems and also for a general economic 
upturn.
