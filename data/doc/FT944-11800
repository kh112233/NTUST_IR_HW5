FT  04 NOV 94 / Hualon plan faces Europe challenge
Northern Ireland's Industrial Development Board has declined to confirm that
the controversial plan by Hualon of Taiwan to build a Pounds 157m Belfast
textiles plant will go ahead if the European Commission's approval of Pounds
61m of aid for the project is challenged in court.
The British Textile and Apparel Confederation, which says the plant will
create unfair competition, said yesterday that it planned to appeal to the
European Court.
Mr Alan Milburn, Labour MP for Darlington and a member of the Commons public
accounts committee, is to urge the committee to ask the Northern Ireland
Audit Office to investigate the project.
