KEEPING SCHOOLS OUT OF THE LINE OF FIRE 
I am a retired elementary school principal from Illinois. While visiting 
California recently, I learned that the certain school board members in the 
Fountain Valley district are being challenged due to school closures. At first, 
I shrugged, thinking "that's politics." 
But -- and this is a big but -- part way through the article the issue of 
"electromagnetic field" was mentioned. 
There is a comprehensive article in the July 9 New Yorker magazine that 
discusses an abnormal amount of cancerous tumors, leukemia, birth defects, etc. 
experienced by individuals living near or attending school under the 
cross-country wires. The article singled out La Jolla and Santa Barbara, in 
addition to Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach. 
How do teachers feel about teaching in schools located under the 
electromagnetic field? Apparently the parents in Fountain Valley are upset 
because a school in a safe zone was closed rather than a (perhaps newer) school 
located under the wires. Was this decision made by the administration or the 
school board? 
Forget the daily radiation danger attributed to the electromagnetic fields for 
the moment. In the event of war, the enemy's first target is the power supply. 
Without power, America is virtually crippled. Can you envision high-tension 
wires raining exploding fireballs onto the playground while innocent children 
are at play? Although the bomb may have been dropped miles away to hit a power 
station, live flames could hopscotch along the wires, raining flames that look 
like fireworks and fall like snowflakes from the skies onto the playground. The 
enemy would not deliberately bomb a schoolyard of no military value, but who 
would expect a school to be built under the electricity? 
Would I have liked to be the principal at a school located under the 
electromagnetic fields? I answer this question with another question: "Would 
you?"
