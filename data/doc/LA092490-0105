IN COURT 
Workers Plead Guilty in Defense Kickbacks Scheme: Two defense industry workers 
pleaded guilty to charges that they received more than $47,000 in kickbacks for 
directing the business of their employers to various defense subcontractors. 
The convictions of Frank Brown, 56, and Raymond Fisher, 67, marked the latest 
in a long-term government investigation of fraud and other improprieties in the 
defense industry. 
Fisher pleaded guilty to failing to report more than $22,000 of income on his 
1984 tax return and more than $18,000 on his 1985 return. Prosecutors said the 
unreported money stemmed from kickbacks he received from directing the business 
of his employer, the Eaton Corp., to various defense subcontractors. In a 
separate case, Brown pleaded guilty to failing to disclose more than $7,000 he 
allegedly received in kickbacks as an employee of Hamilton-Avent and Cetec.
