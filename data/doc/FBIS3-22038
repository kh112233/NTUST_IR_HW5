  [Text] [Anchorwoman Yolanda Ruiz] Another key man in the 
cartel of northern Valle del Cauca has just surrendered. He is 
Joyner Ospina Montoya, charged with drug trafficking and money 
laundering. In the negotiations prior to his surrender, his 
lawyers reportedly reached an agreement on a sentence that could 
mean he would only serve two years in jail. The "National 
Newscast" was the only medium to witness the surrender. 
  [Reporter Sandra Vergara] Joyner Ospina Montoya appeared 
before the Regional Office of the Prosecutor General in Cali at 
1030 this morning. Ospina, his wife, and Cesar Guzman, his 
lawyer, rode in these vehicles from the Plaza de Toros 
neighborhood, south of Cali, to the Regional Office of the 
Prosecutor General. 
  [Begin Guzman recording] This voluntary act is a show of 
confidence and faith in Colombian justice and the policy of 
surrendering. It is a sign of efficient cooperation with 
justice. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Why did he surrender? To what crimes 
will he confess? 
  [Guzman] Mr. Ospina today will confess to violating Law 30, 
the crime of drug trafficking, and money laundering. He will 
not confess to any other crime. [end recording] 
  [Vergara] These crimes could land him in jail for 30 years, 
but thanks to the benefits offered by the law, his sentence 
would be reduced to four years, not counting study and work 
while in prison, which would cut his sentence another two years. 
As the "National Newscast" learned, he will disclose the names 
of other members of the organization and reveal the routes used 
for drug trafficking and money laundering. Joyner Ospina 
Montoya will be interrogated in a few hours, and later he will 
be taken to Palmira Prison. He will be held in the same wing 
where drug trafficker Julio Fabio Urdinola is jailed. 
  [Ruiz] According to the authorities, Joyner Ospina Montoya 
was also the man in charge of transporting the organization's 
drugs. Let us see who he is. 
  [Vergara] Joyner Ospina Montoya, 28 years old, married, and 
father of two children was born in Dovia north of Valle. He is 
another member of the northern drug trafficking ring once headed 
by Juan Urdinola Grajales. He got involved in drug trafficking 
in 1988 in the United States. In 1990 he came to Colombia and 
became the right-hand man of Julio Fabio Urdinola, another 
member of this organization who surrendered to justice 15 days 
ago. 
  Ospina Montoya was in charge of shipping and distributing 
cocaine to the United States. He was also in charge of 
laundering money from the United States to Colombia. To date, 
we have no information of any legal process Colombian justice 
may have against him. We have learned, however, that he is 
facing charges for drug trafficking in U.S. courts. U.S. 
authorities tapped the telephones Ospina Montoya used to make 
all his contacts. In addition, informers confirmed his 
participation in drug trafficking and money laundering.
