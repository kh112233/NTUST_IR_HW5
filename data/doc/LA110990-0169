LOCAL; 
O.C. MAN KILLED ON S.D. FREEWAY 
A Garden Grove man was killed early this morning when he apparently failed to 
make a turn at a San Diego Freeway off-ramp and slammed into a brick wall, 
police said. 
Eiji Morimoto, 27, was pronounced dead at the scene of the 12:39 a.m. accident, 
Fountain Valley Police Sgt. Larry Griswold said. The cause of the single-car 
accident was under investigation. 
Griswold said Morimoto drove his car off the southbound side of the freeway at 
the Ellis Street exit. For an unknown reason, he failed to slow down, sped 
through a red traffic signal and slammed into a brick wall, destroying the car, 
Griswold said. 
Morimoto was not wearing a seat belt, Griswold added.
