  [Text] Beijing, March 2 (XINHUA) -- China's 1993 population 
natural growth rate turned out to be a record low of 11.45 per 
thousand, officials sources said today. 
  The record low rate was achieved between a 18.09 per 
thousand 
birth rate and a 6.64 per thousand death rate in the same year. 
The sources said the death rate is also at one of the lowest 
level since 1949. 
  By the end of 1993, China had a population of 1.18517 
billion, which was 13.46 million more than in 1992, the sources 
said. 
  The sources attributed the drop in the death rate to the 
rise 
in people's living standards and quality, and the improvement of 
health care for women, children and the aged. 
  In 1993, the average income of urban residents went up 10.2 
percent over 1992, and that of rural residents by 3.2 percent. 
The number of hospital beds rose by 1.9 percent and medical 
professionals by 1.1 percent in the same period, the sources 
added.
