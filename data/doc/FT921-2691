FT  18 MAR 92 / FT World Pharmaceuticals Conference: Drugs pricing reforms
urged
SWEEPING changes in European pricing and reimbursement policy for drugs was
proposed yesterday by Dr Armin Kessler, president of the European Federation
of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations.
Dr Kessler, speaking on the second and final day of the Financial Times
World Pharmaceuticals Conference in London, said the trends of
ever-increasing expenditure by pharmaceutical companies on research and
development and ever-greater expenditure on healthcare by governments were
unsustainable.
European countries were increasingly trying to reduce prices, even for
innovatory products, he said. The only alternative available to
pharmaceuticals groups was not to sell certain products in countries where
prices offered by the government were too low. This disadvantaged patients.
The process of price-setting for individual drugs by governments should be
disassociated from government reimbursement to patients and overall
budgetary constraints. In return for greater pricing freedom, European
countries should stop reimbursing patients for drugs which do not require a
prescription. Patients should also pay a larger part of medication obtained
on prescription, he argued.
Dr Kessler called for greater use of generic drugs in Europe. He said this
was necessary, even though it would adversely affect the research-based
pharmaceuticals groups. Not only would generics help keep down government
drugs budgets, but they would also act as a stimulus for the industry to
produce more innovative products.
Mr Peter Ladell, president of Marion Merrell Dow Europe, agreed that the
slower economic growth in the industrialised nations would continue to bring
pressure on drug prices. He argued that studies on the cost effectiveness of
pharma-ceuticals would form an increasingly critical part of pricing
negotiations with governments.
