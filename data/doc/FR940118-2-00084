SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) 25 U.S.C. 2701 

et seq

., was signed into law on October 17, 1988. The IGRA established the National Indian Gaming Commission (the Commission).
Section 2710 of the IGRA authorizes the Commission to approve class II and class III tribal gaming ordinances. Section
2710(d)(2)(B) of the IGRA as implemented by 25 CFR 522.8 (58 FR 5811 (January 22, 1993)), requires the Commission to
publish, in the 

Federal Register

, approved class III gaming ordinances



The IGRA requires all tribal gaming ordinances to contain the same requirements concerning ownership of the gaming
activity, use of net revenues, annual audits, health and safety, background investigations and licensing of key
employees. The Commission, therefore, believes that publication of each ordinance in the 

Federal Register

 would be redundant and result in an unnecessary cost to the Commission. The Commission believes that publishing a
notice of approval of each class III gaming ordinance is sufficient to meet the requirements of 25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(2)(B).
Also, the Commission will make copies of approved class III ordinances available to the public upon request. Requests
can be made in writing to: National Indian Gaming Commission, 1850 M St. NW., suite 250, Washington, DC 20036.

The Chairman has approved tribal gaming ordinances authorizing class III gaming for the following Indian tribes:




Ak-Chin Indian Community

Bois Forte Band of Chippewa Indians

Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Indian Reservation

Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians

Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache Indian Community
