<F P=106> [Interview with Silvia Saca, deputy chairman of Moldovan </F>
Women's Association, by E. Albu: "Silvia Saca: `We Are Not a 
Charitable Organization'"] 
  [Text] I was heading for one room and ended up in 
another--that is, using my memory as a guide, I went down 
Sadovaya Street, looking for the old building where the former 
republic society for relations with foreign countries had been 
located, and learned that it was now the site of the American 
embassy.... People directed me around the corner, to the Dacnea 
Association for International Relations and the Moldovan Women's 
Association. It is a beautiful snow-white building resembling a 
triple-decker ship. It has spacious lobbies with upholstered 
armchairs, walls lined with elaborate oil paintings, posters, 
and etchings, bouquets of flowers in ceramic vases.... Sublime 
beauty, without a doubt, but what lies "within"? 
  In the reception area of the Moldovan Women's Association I 
was greeted by a young, attractive, and extremely friendly 
woman--Silvia Saca. 
  [Albu] Just what kind of entity is the Moldovan Women's 
Association, of which you are the deputy chairman? Does it stand 
for "aesthetic emancipation"? 
  [Saca] We are a sociopolitical organization, not a party. 
  [Albu] But why do you use the word "political"? 
  [Saca] We would like to take part in elections, but a social 
organization does not have the constitutional right to do this. 
There are only seven women in the Moldovan Parliament and one 
woman minister in the government. These figures are ridiculously 
low. 
  [Albu] What kind of relationship do you have with the 
Christian Democratic Women's League? 
  [Saca] Now it is good, but it was an exceptionally strained 
relationship in the past. 
  [Albu] With the possible exception of the Amazon warriors, 
women have always been against bloodshed. The image of the 
bare-breasted maiden with the flowing hair, carrying a banner 
through the rubble of the barricades, is ludicrous. It can only 
be seen in a Delacroix painting.... 
  [Saca] We are against bloodshed.... 
  [Albu] I was in the Dniester zone recently. The women of 
Bender, Tiraspol, and Dubasari whose sons are dead or disabled 
have announced their intention to promote peaceful consolidation 
and want to meet the women of Chisinau, Orhei, Stresen, and 
Belt.... Are the women of Chisinau willing and able to organize 
this kind of meeting today as a reproach to all of the 
"frontline combatants"? 
  [Saca] We are willing..., but relations between the two 
sides 
are still not encouraging, and the progression toward this kind 
of meeting will have to be gradual. 
  [Albu] President Mircea Snegur's message to the inhabitants 
of the Moldovan Left Bank includes this valid statement: "The 
main thing now is not to put all of the blame on one side and 
ascribe all virtues to the other. We will never be able to move 
from this kind of black-and-white position to a mutually 
acceptable peace agreement." It is true that this is an 
essential condition for the resolution of conflicts. Has your 
association made any attempts at this kind of convergence? 
  [Saca] Yes. Six women, active members of our association 
headed by L.E. Scalna, had a meeting with General Lebed. 
  [Albu] When?!! 
  [Saca] In August 1992, following the gruesome events. 
  [Albu] How did the meeting go? 
  [Saca] We managed to have an agreeable conversation without 
much effort. After all, the general has his own ideas about the 
honor of an officer. This time he was talking to women, however, 
and there was no need for arrogance. 
  [Albu] How did the conversation begin? 
  [Saca] At first we addressed him as Sir (Domnul) General. He 
bristled and turned somber and aloof: "I do not care for that." 
"Comrade" did not suit him either. "Then let us address you by 
your name and patronymic--Aleksandr Ivanovich." He relaxed right 
away. 
  [Albu] Then what happened? Did you discuss the "pacifist" 
Andreyeva? 
  [Saca] Yes, but we spent more time talking about the main 
thing. We said that the conflict seemed to have run its course, 
thank God, but the 14th Russian Army had furnished the "people" 
on both sides of the Dniester with huge quantities of weapons. 
  From the conversation with A. Lebed: 
  "What next? Just strike a match.... I guarantee that no more 
weapons will be plundered, squandered, or `distributed.'" 
  "Why did you change your mind about the Dniester 
government?" 
  "I cannot bear corruption...." 
  After our conversation, General Lebed gave up his seat as a 
deputy of the Dniester Republic (although many had known in 
advance that politics is no occupation for a general) because 
fighters from the Dniester had defended the White House in 
October this year, taking the side of A. Rutskoy and R. 
Khasbulatov after they had been outlawed by the presidential 
edict of B. Yeltsin. 
  From the conversation with A. Lebed: 
  "What kind of relationship do you have with the Moldovan 
leadership?" 
  "None." 
  "If you were invited to form a Moldovan National Army and 
were asked to take an oath of allegiance to Moldova, would you 
agree to do this?" 
  He almost turned green: "I would not betray my homeland." It 
was obvious that this was not a man who would go against his own 
convictions. After the conversation it was clear that the rift 
between "yours" and "ours" had to be repaired. 
  [Albu] There were so many disenfranchised families, disabled 
veterans, and refugees after the Dniester conflict. Did the 
Moldovan Women's Association come to their aid? 
  [Saca] Yes, we set up a social fund and opened a bank 
account. 
  [Albu] Where did you get the money? 
  [Saca] We asked enterprise managers for contributions and 
"squeezed" money out of every possible source. 
  [Albu] Was there a good response? 
  [Saca] Yes. The Zorile firm is a good example. The situation 
there is just the same as everywhere else today: It is not that 
good. Many things are in short supply or are lacking, but 
General Director V.V. Gervasev, who seemed so grim at first, 
nevertheless "came up with" 300 pairs of shoes.... It was such a 
strong and warmhearted response. There were other examples as 
well. 
  [Albu] What about private aid? 
  [Saca] With the money from the association fund, we were 
able 
to offer financial assistance to families who had lost their 
breadwinner and to disabled veterans of the bloody conflict, we 
paid for prosthetic appliances, and we sent victims--some of 
whom had lost arms and legs--to Romania for treatment.... 
  [Albu] Did the association also offer aid to the indigent? 
  [Saca] Rumors of our "generosity" apparently spread 
throughout Moldova. People came here and are still coming here 
from distant rural communities, incurring financial losses and 
travel expenses, but we are not a charitable organization. 
  [Albu] Then what is the purpose of the activities of the 
Moldovan Women's Association and your fund? 
  [Saca] We are collecting useful ideas, so that they can 
start 
"working" for the society. 
  [Albu] How? 
  [Saca] We were instrumental, for example, in the 
establishment of the "Businesswomen's Club." 
  [Albu] We have heard more than enough about businessmen, but 
who are these "businesswomen"? ...Are they "blue stockings"? 
  [Saca] They are women with professional expertise, primarily 
economic and organizational skills. Women who have succeeded in 
commerce and business, in firms and offices, will share their 
business experience with younger women. After all, many have a 
sincere wish to start their own businesses, to try their hand 
and test their skills in a chosen field, but the system of 
distribution did not give them the necessary experience or 
knowledge. 
  [Albu] In other words, as V. Rozanov said: "All property in 
Russia was `begged, borrowed, or stolen.'" There is little labor 
invested in this property, and that is why the tradition of 
ownership is weak and is not respected. 
  [Saca] That is exactly the situation today. People are 
confused by privatization and are ready to "beg" and allow 
themselves to accept a "gift." "Begging" is embarrassing at 
first, but it gets easier.... Later it becomes a habit. 
  Our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a 
blind person from Bender and then of a mother carrying a 
baby. 
  [Albu] I suppose they come to you with their personal family 
problems? 
  [Saca] Of course. A woman recently came here. She was what 
we 
shamelessly refer to as a single mother. She was a qualified 
specialist in a construction field and asked us to help her get 
a shorter work day. "Call the boss," she asked us, "and give him 
a piece of your mind." I explained to her that we do not have 
"telephone prerogatives" of that kind. We can offer advice and 
suggestions, we can offer legal assistance, we can suggest how 
women might extricate themselves from difficult family 
situations and counsel them on the proper upbringing of a son or 
daughter. We are constantly dealing with complex situations of 
this kind, but many people, and not just women, are regrettably 
accustomed to getting something for nothing. 
  [Albu] How did you decide to resolve difficult interpersonal 
conflicts with the aid of the association? 
  [Saca] Here is one way. The Doina and Ion Aldea-Teodorovic 
Fund was set up at our "suggestion." We want to use this fund to 
help the artistic intelligentsia and people on pensions, to 
encourage the advancement of talented children, and to instill 
good taste, cultural sensitivity, and creativity in young 
people.... 
  [Albu] How are contacts established in these cases? 
  [Saca] Tatiana Pirkalab, one of our sponsors, visited the 
home of Doina's mother, Eugenia Marin, and informed her that her 
grandson Cristi, the son of Doina and Ion, was under the 
patronage of our association and fund. 
  [Albu] He is probably not the only beneficiary of the 
association sponsors' generous support.... 
  [Saca] A school for disabled boys and girls (only a few for 
now) was founded through the efforts of our "think tank" and our 
considerate patrons. Some will be trained as tailors, and others 
will learn English, translation, and typing. In short, we do 
have plans and ideas. 
  [Albu] In your efforts to build a new social relationship 
between different segments of the population in the republic and 
to establish contacts between the haves and have-nots, are you 
giving up some of the good old traditions? In public health 
care, for instance? 
  [Saca] No. We feel that the Soviet system of maternity 
health 
care was the best in the world. 
  [Albu] Is the Moldovan Women's Association threatened by the 
"governmental void"? 
  [Saca] We hope not....
