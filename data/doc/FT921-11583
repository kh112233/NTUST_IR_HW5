FT  31 JAN 92 / Honduran forestry dealruns into opposition
A CONTROVERSIAL forestry agreement, signed last September by Honduras and
the Chicago-based paper company Stone Container Corporation, is in trouble
following a wave of protest.
The agreement was to have been ratified by the Honduran Congress today, but
the protests, from environmentalists and others, have caused worries in the
ruling National Party.
A supplementary agreement designed to answer protesters' concerns is under
discussion, but is unlikely to go to Congress before March.
Stone is expected to launch today a belated publicity campaign to try to win
support from sceptical Hondurans.
The agreement, still officially secret but widely leaked, involves a 40-year
concession to exploit between 125,000 and 1.6m hectares of pine forest in
the Mosquitia region of the undeveloped east for woodchip production. This
would supply Stone's US paper mills. It also contemplates construction of a
pulp mill in Honduras.
The government hopes the deal will generate Dollars 2m a year in export
revenues and up to 3,000 local jobs. The state-owned land is to be ceded
rent-free, with infrastructure provided. In return, Stone will supply
technical assistance to the government on sustainable forest exploitation
and pay normal logging fees.
Environmentalists are concerned that clear-cutting on the fragile hill
slopes will cause soil erosion and river silting, and that the possible
development of related paper production industries could bring chemical
pollution, undermining the potential of Mosquitia for ecotourism.
The deal represents a shift away from Honduran forestry policy of
privatising state sawmills and and promoting sustainable exploitation
through fiscal incentives to private operators.
Other legislation before Congress would scrap a requirement for 51 per cent
local participation in forest exploitation.
