  Yesterday, the Chinese authorities detained and interrogated 
Carrie Gracie, a female journalist with BBC. She was taken away 
for interrogation when she was going to go out by car with three 
Chinese friends. 
  Before that, she had met and talked with some Chinese 
friends 
who were regarded as dissidents. According to reports by 
foreign news agencies, Gracie was taken away at 0200 in the 
early morning and the interrogation lasted until 0600. 
  According to one of her friends, the Chinese public security 
authorities mainly interrogated her about the content of her 
talk with her Chinese friends in the late afternoon. Finally, 
they said that she did not follow the law by carrying her 
reporter's identification card, and asked her to sign some 
papers before releasing her. Her three friends also were 
released after being interrogated. [passage omitted]
