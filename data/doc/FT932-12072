FT  30 APR 93 / Czech-Slovak leaders to hold emergency talks
THE Czech and Slovak prime ministers will hold an emergency meeting today
following yesterday's unexpected cancellation of talks between finance
ministers aimed at settling financial issues emerging from the two
countries' recent division.
A spokesman for Mr Julius Toth, the Slovak finance minister, said
yesterday's talks were called off as neither side was ready for further
discussions.
But now Mr Vaclav Klaus and Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Czech and Slovak prime
ministers, will meet in an effort to defuse the increasingly bitter dispute
between the two countries over dividing the assets of the former
Czechoslovak state.
Mr Klaus yesterday called for the direct talks to resolve 'the current
crisis between the two republics.'
The dispute over who is owed what from the former Czechoslovak state has
escalated since the two countries went their separate ways on January 1.
Prague says it is owed CzK 24.7bn (Dollars 882m), a claim rejected by
Bratislava which has made its own claim for compensation.
