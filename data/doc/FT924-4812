FT  01 DEC 92 / Dutch train crash kills 5
Five people were killed and 36 injured when a crowded Dutch train was
derailed on a commuter line yesterday, Reuter reports from Amsterdam.
Hundreds of rescue workers struggled to pull survivors from the wreckage of
the seven-carriage train that came off the rails 15 km south-west of
Amsterdam. The train was en route from the city to Flushing.
Four of the dead were in the front carriage which crashed into trees before
coming to rest on its side. The fifth victim was a railway employee who was
working alongside the track and was crushed under the second carriage. Badly
injured survivors were taken to hospitals in Amsterdam, Leiden and Haarlem.
The cause of the accident was not known but a railway spokesman said there
was another derailment at the same spot on Saturday. No-one was injured in
the earlier accident and the spokesman said it was too early to conclude
that the two derailments were linked.
