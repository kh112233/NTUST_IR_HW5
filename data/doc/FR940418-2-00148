SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The petitions were received on April 30, 1992 (sodium nitriolotriacetate monohydrate), June 29, 1992 (diphenyl
oxide), and July 2, 1992 (tetrachlorophthalic anhydride). The petitioner is Monsanto Company, a manufacturer and
exporter of these substances. The following is a summary of the information contained in the petitions. The complete
petitions are available in the Internal Revenue Service Freedom of Information Reading Room.



Sodium nitriolotriacetate monohydrate





HTS number: 

2922.49.60.00

C

AS number: 

18662538




This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals methane, sodium hydroxide, propylene, and ammonia. Sodium
nitriolotriacetate monohydrate is a solid produced predominantly by the reaction of formaldehyde with hydrogen
cyanide in the presence of a catalyst, which is then further reacted with sodium hydroxide to produce sodium nitriolotriacetate
monohydrate.

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: 3 CH

 (hydrogen).

According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 61.1 percent by weight of the materials used to produce this
substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $2.45 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for methane
of 0.24, a conversion factor for sodium hydroxide of 0.52, a conversion factor for propylene of 0.25, and a conversion
factor for ammonia of 0.10.



Diphenyl oxide





HTS number:

 2909.30.00.00



CAS number:

 101848




This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals benzene and propylene. Diphenyl oxide is a solid produced predominantly
by the catalytic condensation of phenol.

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: 2 C

6

H

6

 (benzene) + 2 C

According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 78.9 percent by weight of the materials used to produce this
substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $8.13 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for benzene
of 1.05 and a conversion factor for propylene of 0.62.



Tetrachlorophthalic anhydride





HTS number: 

2916.19.00.00

CAS number: 117088




This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals chlorine and xylene. Tetrachlorophthalic anhydride is a solid
produced predominantly by the high temperature reaction of phthalic anhydride with chlorine. Phthalic anhydride
is produced by the reaction of o-xylene with air in the presence of a catalyst.

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is: 4 Cl

2

 (chlorine) + C

O (water) + 4 HCl (hydrogen chloride).

According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 80 percent by weight of the materials used to produce this
substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $5.87 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for chlorine
of 1.22 and a conversion factor for xylene of 0.53.
