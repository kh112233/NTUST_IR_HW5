FT  10 FEB 94 / Observer: Bond - the sequel
Prozac the wonder drug - it's said by some users to induce a sense of
well-being - is being given lots of free PR in Australia at the moment,
thanks to Alan Bond, the Australian tycoon whose fortunes have recently
withered somewhat.
Bond has been admitted to a Perth hospital, apparently suffering from
depression; part of his treatment is Prozac. His lawyers successfully
applied for an adjournment of a court hearing to decide whether he is fit to
give evidence at a bankruptcy examination on March 21. The fitness hearing
has been adjourned to March 14, when further psychiatric evidence is likely
to be presented.
A psychiatrist employed by Bond's lawyers said that he 'cries more often
than previously' and 'repeatedly feels that he is unable to go on'. Bond's
appearance is said to be 'consistent with patients with severe depression'.
It adds that 'he appears . . . to have difficulty in recalling even people
he appears to know well'.
