  [Text] First Deputy Foreign Minister Vladislovas Domarkas 
described as rather strange the reproaches by Russian diplomats 
that Lithuania allegedly is ignoring proposals to define the 
economic zones of both countries in the Baltic Sea. 
  Sergey Prikhotko, head of the Baltic states department at 
the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Second European 
Directorate-- commenting on the note issued by Lithuania 
concerning Russia's intentions to exploit the B6 oil deposit, 
which is situated in the sea not far from Nida--said in an 
interview to the Baltic News Service [BNS] that Lithuania failed 
to respond to the proposals advanced by Russia on the 
demarcation of the economic zones. 
  Domarkas, who is head of the state commission for 
demarcation 
of the state borders, told BNS that it was Russia who was 
avoiding negotiations on demarcation of economic zones in the 
Baltic Sea. At the latest meeting held by the negotiators in 
Vilnius at the end of January, more attention was given to the 
problems of maritime borders. It was at that time that the 
Lithuanian negotiators presented a draft of maritime state 
border demarcation prepared by the Lithuanian land surveying 
service. 
  The next meeting of the Lithuanian and Russian commissions 
for the demarcation of the state borders will be held in March 
in Kaliningrad or Moscow.
