 

An immediate moratorium, effective October 23, 1992, was established on the importation of 10 species of wild birds
of particular concern that were listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES, or Convention), two of which were moved to Appendix I at the March 1992 CITES meeting.
The prohibition on importation of those species was announced in the 

Federal Register

 on December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57510). 
During the one-year period immediately following enactment of the WBCA, from October 23, 1992, to October 22, 1993,
import quotas were established for CITES-listed bird species. Those quotas were announced in the 

Federal Register

 on December 4, 1992 (57 FR 57510). A notice published on March 30, 1993 (58 FR 16644), solicited public comments and
announced a public meeting, held April 1516, 1993, to receive input from the public for the development of regulations
to implement some of the provisions of the WBCA. Useful input was received from a broad cross-section of interested
members of the public who participated in the meeting and submitted comments in writing; that input has been used to
develop this final rule. A notice published on April 16, 1993 (58 FR 19840), announced species for which the quotas
had been met and no further individual birds could be imported. 
With the publication of the final rule of November 16, 1993, imports of all CITES-listed birds (as defined in the final
rule) are prohibited, except for (a) species included in an approved list; (b) specimens for which an import permit
has been issued; (c) species from countries that have approved management plans for those species; or (d) specimens
from approved foreign captive-breeding facilities. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a proposed
rule in the 

Federal Register

 on March 17, 1994 (59

#

FR 12784), that would implement procedures for approval of foreign captive-breeding facilities and establishment
of an approved list of species listed in the CITES Appendices that can be imported without a WBCA permit; that approved
list is published herein. 
As a result of a lawsuit filed on February 15, 1994, by the Humane Society of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife,
and a resultant District Court Order that found a portion of the regulation in the November 16, 1993, 

Federal Register

 (58 FR 60524) invalid, the Service, consistent with that Court Order, announced in the 

Federal Register

 on May 24, 1994 (59 FR 26810), that all exotic birds listed in Appendix III of CITES are covered by the automatic import
moratorium of the WBCA, regardless of their country of origin. A proposed rule was published on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28826),
to promulgate that regulatory change. 
This rule finalizes those proposals made in the 

Federal Register

 of March 17, 1994, for the approved list of captive-bred species, with some modifications based on comments received
and further analysis by the Service. The proposed regulations for the approval of foreign breeding facilities and
the approved list for wild-caught CITES-listed species will be addressed in a future final rulemaking.
