Ortho Pharmaceutical will initially pay a 5% royalty to Amgen Inc. to sell the 
anti-anemia drug erythropoietin, or EPO, less than the 10% royalty some Wall 
Street analysts had expected. Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. analyst Jeffrey Swarz 
said the information is in a licensing agreement contained in a Delaware 
lawsuit filed by Ortho against the Thousand Oaks biotechnology firm in a 
dispute over their marketing agreement. Swarz said Amgen will receive the 5% 
royalty until Ortho, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, recovers an estimated $50 
million provided Amgen to develop the drug.
