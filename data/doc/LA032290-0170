WESTSIDE DIGEST: MID-WILSHIRE; 
JEWISH TUTORS SOUGHT 
The Bureau of Jewish Education is seeking trained tutors to help the children 
of Soviet Jewish immigrants with their schoolwork. 
According to a spokesperson for the bureau, more than 1,700 Soviet Jews settled 
in Los Angeles in 1989, and 3,000 more are expected this year. 
The immigrant parents do not usually speak English, and their children 
typically need help with both their English- and Hebrew-language studies. 
The bureau, at 6505 Wilshire Blvd., is the educational arm of the Jewish 
Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. It provides services to 25,000 
students in Jewish schools and educational programs. 
Only skilled tutors are sought because no training is available. 
Children to be tutored range in age from 5 to 18. 
For more information, call Esther Krisman at (213) 852-7702.
