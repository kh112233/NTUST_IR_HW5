  [Text] Karlsruhe (DPA) -- A former official of the Workers 
Party of Kurdistan [PKK] was seriously injured by several shots 
fired at him in Krefeld on 2 May. According to statements made 
by the Federal Prosecutor's Office on 4 May, there is a 
suspicion that the crime was committed by members of a terrorist 
group within the PKK, because the 33-year-old victim intended to 
leave the Workers Party. 
  In June 1992, the Higher Regional Court in Celle sentenced 
the former high PKK official to a prison term of four years and 
two months for serious deprivation of liberty and dangerous 
injury. Meanwhile, he has served his prison term. The federal 
prosecutor general has asked the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigation to conduct the investigations on the attack.
