FT  09 SEP 94 / Ploughed back into swords: Peace deals will not stop
military spending rising in the Middle East
Even as King Hussein of Jordan was shaking hands with Israeli prime minister
Yitzhak Rabin on the White House lawn on July 25,US military officials were
busy preparing a package of arms deliveries to assist in the modernisation
of Jordan's armed forces.
The US pledge to upgrade Jordan's military, coupled with Washington's
promises to forgive up to Dollars 700m of the Dollars 950m debt owed to it
by Jordan, were important incentives for the King to make peace with Israel.
However incongruous it may seem, the unfolding Middle East peace is likely
to increase, not decrease, arms-related spending in the region. Continuing
hostility between governments, fuelled by political ambitions, border
conflicts and the challenge of Islamic fundamentalism, means that regional
military expenditure as a proportion of gross national product is likely to
remain above 20 per cent for the foreseeable future. Most Gulf states are
already running budget deficits.
Since Israel's peace breakthrough with the Palestinians last summer, some
Israeli officials have argued that one of the most important economic
dividends would be the re-allocation of billions of dollars spent on the
military forces of the Middle East. In 1991 alone, the region is estimated
to have allocated Dollars 88bn to military expenditure, a figure heavily
influenced by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf
war.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, proudly predicted in biblical
terms that the region would soon beat swords into plowshares. He foresaw a
region of government by ballots not bullets, where the only generals would
be General Motors and General Electric.
However, the trend has so far been in the opposite direction. The Israeli
army says the redeployment of troops from occupied Palestinian territory
will place additional burdens on its defence budget for several years. The
US has already granted Israel an extra Dollars 28m, on top of its annual
military aid of Dollars 1.8bn, to meet those costs. General Ehud Barak, army
chief of staff, is seeking an extra Shk500m (Dollars 170m) for the 1995
defence budget. That would be in addition to the Shk250m in 'special'
budgetary support that has already supplemented this year's Shk20.5bn total.
Domestic military expenditure is being augmented by US military assistance,
pledged as a result of peace developments. Washington is committed to
providing military aircraft: the first deliveries of 50 F-16 fighter jets
arrived in Israel in early August. In January, Israel signed a Dollars 2bn
contract with McDonnell Douglas to buy 20 F-15-E 'Eagle' warplanes, adapted
for longer-range pre-emptive missions, night-flying capabilities and air
superiority.
A possible peace agreement in the next few months with Syria, Israel's most
militarily powerful neighbour, would not ease the burden on the Israeli
defence budget. There would be further withdrawal costs as Israel pulled out
of the Syrian land it occupies, and Israel is determined to purchase
military hardware to maintain a 'strong deterrent profile' in return for
giving up strategic land such as the Golan plateau.
'The aim is long-term investment in unique battle weapons that Arab states
cannot buy,' said Lt Col Moshe Foegel, Israeli military spokesman.
Military experts said US arms transfers to Israel, Egypt, Jordan and perhaps
later to other Arab states that make peace with Israel would require large
increases in spending on runways, maintenance, training, spare parts and
salaries. 'In the short term, peace agreements will increase, not decrease,
Israel's military expenditures,' said Professor Eliahu Konovsky of Bar-Ilan
University, near Tel Aviv.
Apart from the cost of Israel's peace treaties with Arab neighbours, there
are deeper geo-political reasons for believing the military dividend from
peace is likely to prove illusory throughout the Middle East. Military
experts in Israel say the most potent threat in the past decade has been
from Iran and Iraq, not Syria or Jordan.
Iran, though diminished as a military force since the overthrow of the Shah
in 1979 and its eight-year war with Iraq until 1988, remains ideologically
opposed to the Jewish state. Tehran has sought to rebuild its armed forces
with purchases primarily from Russia and China, and has devoted some 18 per
cent of its annual budget to the military.
However, Iran's failure to manage its economy efficiently and the steep
decline in oil prices have severely limited the regime's scope for military
development.
Iraq, while considerably weakened by the Gulf war and UN sanctions, also
remains a potential menace to its neighbours, especially to Kuwait to which
it has not renounced territorial claims.
Suggestions that Iraq might be seeking to improve relations with Iran send
shivers down Israel's spine, as do editorials in US newspapers arguing for
an easing of UN sanctions against Iraq. 'As soon as UN sanctions are lifted,
the clock will start ticking for us and for the whole region,' said Lt Col
Foegel. 'While it's true that the short-term threat of war against Israel
has decreased, there are serious long-term concerns, especially from Iran
and from Iraq, when it is allowed to start rearming.'
Israel is not alone in fearing a renewal of Iraq's expansionist dreams.
Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have all suffered Iraqi troops on their soil
in the past decade. The more general threat of Islamic extremism, sponsored
by Iran, gives some countries another reason for making strategic arms
purchases and building deterrent capabilities.
Saudi Arabia, for example, which might have been vulnerable if Iraq had
continued its advance after the capture of Kuwait in 1990, had a defence
budget last year of Dollars 16.5bn - the region's highest. Since the
invasion of Kuwait, Riyadh has embarked on a big armaments programme,
ordering Dollars 30bn worth of arms from the US and UK. The latest Saudi
purchases, including the 1992 US package of 72 F-15XP fighter aircraft and
900 Maverick missiles worth Dollars 9bn, follow imports of Dollars 29.7bn
between 1987 and 1991, according to the US Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency.
Kuwait is spending at least Dollars 12bn replacing and upgrading its armed
forces, which were decimated by Iraq's occupation. Syria is believed to have
bought at least Dollars 2bn worth of aircraft, tanks and missiles from
Russia, North Korea and China since 1992. The money was mostly a grant from
Saudi Arabia (Dollars 1.5bn) and other Gulf states after Syria's
participation in the Gulf war.
Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 and received grants
and debt cancellations worth Dollars 8bn from the US after the Gulf war, has
urged the US not to cut annual military aid of Dollars 1.3bn.
The unwillingness of many Arab countries, even those at peace with Israel,
to consider cuts in their armed forces also reflects the historical
suspicion of Israeli intentions which, despite current peace moves, remains
just below the surface. They view with concern Israel's secret nuclear
capability, its latest military purchases and its widening technological
superiority.
Prof Konovsky argues Arab states will also continue to invest heavily in
their armed forces because of regional disputes over borders and water.
Saudi Arabia has border disputes with several neighbours; Iraq still lays
claim to Kuwait; Syria and Turkey are in conflict over land and the waters
of the Euphrates river; while the UAE and the other Arab Gulf states are
seeking to reverse Iran's occupation of three small islands near the Strait
of Hormuz.
The Arab-Israel peace process remains just one element in this complex
mosaic of tensions and rivalries, and despite Mr Peres's optimism, will not
of itself promote a wider settlement of outstanding issues. For western and
Middle Eastern governments to begin to address issues such as regional arms
control, countries like Iran and Iraq will have to be drawn back into the
framework of more normal international relations.
There is, as yet, little idea of how this can be achieved, while the danger
grows that other countries, such as Algeria, could be added to the list of
governments with which the west is struggling to come to terms. And while
the arms spending continues, the diversion of limited resources to
non-productive ends can but deepen the poverty in which too much of the
Middle East is steeped, and which provides such a fertile recruiting ground
for extremists. In this vicious circle, only the arms manufacturers seem
likely to come out ahead.
