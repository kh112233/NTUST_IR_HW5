  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Cuban economic developments monitored through 8 March. 
  The country's gross income from tourism in 1993 was $720 
million, 30 percent more than in 1992, according to Osmany 
Cienfuegos, Council of Ministers vice president. Cienfuegos has 
added the government expects to earn approximately $1 billion 
this year from tourism, considered one of the strategic sectors 
that helps the country overcome the difficult economic situation 
it has been facing for the past three years. He has said by 
1996 income from tourism will surpass sugar sales, the country's 
main source of foreign exchange, and that in the near future, 
tourism will be the second most important sector in Cuban 
foreign trade, after the medical-pharmaceutical and 
biotechnological industry. (Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish
