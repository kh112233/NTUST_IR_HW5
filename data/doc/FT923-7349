FT  19 AUG 92 / Rwanda's government and rebels end war
RWANDA'S government and rebels yesterday signed a formal accord that
promises sweeping political reforms and an end to a 22-month civil war in
their tiny central African country, Reuter reports from Arusha, Tanzania.
The accord was signed by Rwandan Foreign Minister Boniface Ngulinzira and
rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front's (RPF) Pasteur Bizimungu after a week of
talks in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
'The two parties concur that national unity, democracy and peace are
invaluable and solemnly undertake to do everything possible to preserve them
in the interest of Rwandan generations,' the feuding parties said in a joint
statement.
The accord calls for an all-party interim government, overhaul of the
judiciary, legislature and executive and the creation of a watchdog body to
monitor human rights abuses.
Talks on demands by the rebel for the integration of RPF soldiers into a
reformed national army and the return home of some 250,000 refugees are due
to start in Arusha on September 7.
The rebels, who first invaded from Uganda in October 1990 and whose ranks
are dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe, have been fighting the army of
the dominant Hutu.
The Hutu seized power from the Tutsi monarchy three decades ago in bloody
uprisings that killed 100,000 people.
The terms of the agreements will be effective from January 10 next year.
The two sides are observing an internationally-brokered ceasefire which will
be monitored by a neutral 50-man African military observer group from
Senegal, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.
The force is expected in Kigali, Rwanda, this week.
