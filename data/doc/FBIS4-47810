<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jerome Bicamumpaka by </F>
correspondent Beate Mueller-Blattau; place and date not 
given--recorded, in French with superimposed translation in 
German] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Welcome to the first part of Villa Bonn. 
The civil war and mass murders in Rwanda have, according to 
international estimates, already brought a death toll of 
200,000. Half a million people have fled in the past few days to 
Tanzania. Most of them belong to the Hutu population, which at 
the moment also forms the transitional government. They are 
fleeing from the rebels of the Patriotic Front of Rwanda -- who 
are mostly Tutsis -- who are taking revenge for the Hutu army's 
massacre of the civilian population. Beate Mueller-Blattau 
spoke with Jerome Bicamumpaka, the Rwandan foreign minister of 
the Hutu transitional government. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Minister, a soldier of the UN Blue Helmets 
in Kigali has said of the soldiers of the Rwandan Army, and also 
of the rebels, roughly: They are savages, they are behaving 
like animals. They are all murderers, the one side and the 
other. Is this true? 
  [Bicamumpaka] I would say that this is partly true. It is 
like this. The soldiers of the Patriotic Front -- the RPF -- 
attacked Rwanda from the neighboring country of Uganda. In so 
doing they broke the cease-fire that was negotiated in April of 
last year. Then, however, on 6 April, the RPF rebels attacked 
Rwandan Army positions in the north, on the Ugandan border, and 
also in Kigali. During these attacks they carried out massacres 
of the civilian population, because these people had helped the 
Army when the RPF opened fire. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] I still do not understand. You say that 
civilians were killed during these attacks. Were they Hutus or 
Tutsis? 
  [Bicamumpaka] You should realize that the Patriotic Front 
consists almost 100 percent of Tutsis. So there are very few 
Hutus in the RPF. The civilians slaughtered by the rebels were 
mainly Hutus, people living on the border with Uganda. To go 
back to the Rwandan Army, it was attacked in Kigali, too, and 
there the rebels infiltrated their fighters into private houses 
that belonged to people who are accomplices of the RPF. The 
Rwandan Army then did the following: They attacked the houses 
of the RPF-sympathizers in order to get hold of the rebels. 
Civilians were killed in the process. Incidentally, those who 
were hiding RPF rebels in Kigali were predominantly Tutsis. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] But I still do not understand. Are you 
trying to say that the Tutsis are the guilty ones and the Hutus 
innocent? 
  [Bicamumpaka] It is not a question of claiming that one side 
is guilty and the other side innocent. It is a question of what 
occurred on 6 April this year and the causes of the massacre. 
At that time the RPF not only assassinated the Rwandan 
president, but also, shortly afterward, the rebels attacked the 
Rwandan Army's military camps in Kigali and in the north of the 
country. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] So who has been murdering whom? 
  [Bicamumpaka] You cannot say that it is the Army that has 
committed the atrocities. It was the people of the different 
ethnic groups slaughtering each other. Our army has even 
prevented murders. There is no more killing. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Can there be any reason on earth that 
justifies these massacres? 
  [Bicamumpaka] No, these murders are never justified, this 
war 
is completely absurd. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] But you still have not answered my 
question 
-- who killed whom? For us it is very difficult to understand 
all this. 
  [Bicamumpaka] Before any investigations have been carried 
out 
it is very difficult to say exactly that this person has 
murdered that one. But to put it in general terms, the Tutsis 
and Hutus have massacred each other to an equal extent. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] It wasn't just the Tutsis who were the 
victims. Some reports say that about 5,000 people, mainly 
Tutsis, were detained in a stadium in Kigali and that every 
night about 40 to 50 of them were shot dead. 
  [Bicamumpaka] That is true, about 5,000 refugees are there. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Tutsis? 
  [Bicamumpaka] No, they are not just Tutsis. There are of 
course Hutus there too. In Kigali there are, for example, 
hotels accommodating both Hutu and Tutsi refugees. Five hundred 
people are at present living in the [word indistinct] hotel. 
There is a gymnasium accommodating at least 3,000 refugees, 
both Hutus and Tutsis. But the RPF rebels have been shooting at 
these places with artillery for the past few days -- for example 
the school with the 3,000 people. They are therefore attacking 
Hutus, Tutsis, men, women, and children. The rebels are doing 
this in order to arouse international attention and claim 
afterward that it was the Rwandan Army. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] So, it is just the rebels who are 
murdering, not the Army? 
  [Bicamumpaka] No, the Army is not killing any civilians, 
while the RPF is murdering innocent people. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Not the Army? 
  [Bicamumpaka] No, at most there are a few exceptions. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] The Army consists of Hutus, and the 
rebels of Tutsis. Is that right? So the two tribes are in fact 
again fighting each other? 
  [Bicamumpaka] You cannot put it in such sweeping terms. The 
RPF rebels have already said that they are not in the least 
interested in whether all the Tutsis, thus their own people, are 
massacred in the country's interior. It is a matter of total 
indifference to the Patriotic Front. It wants power in the 
country and nothing else. If the rebels do not even defend the 
Tutsis and even arbitrarily subject them to dangers, it is proof 
that they have totally different aims. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] A very complicated civil war is taking 
place in your country, but you still claim that your 
government's Army is disciplined and does not kill. That is 
very difficult to believe. 
  [Bicamumpaka] Of course the Army kills, but it kills the 
aggressor. The rebels are attacking the soldiers, that means 
that members of the Rwandan Army are merely defending 
themselves, just like in war. Our army's soldiers are killing 
their enemies, but our government's military do not attack 
provinces and communities in order to murder civilians there. 
That is shown for example by the fact that our government has 
convened assemblies in many communities in order to halt the 
massacres. We have succeeded in this in the seven prefectures 
under our control. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] How many people have been killed so far? 
  [Bicamumpaka] One thing is certain, I regard the figure of 
100,000 given by the Red Cross as grossly exaggerated. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] So how many was it exactly? 
  [Bicamumpaka] Perhaps 10,000, but it is difficult to say 
without exact counting. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] So the Red Cross is wrong? They gave the 
information that at least 100,000 were massacred. 
  [Bicamumpaka] But the Red Cross cannot know that. How can it 
know precise figures? The Red Cross gives humanitarian aid. It 
cannot count the number of wounded and dead or even estimate 
them. How could it? There are no witnesses to give evidence. 
There is no personnel that could gain specific on-site 
information, that is not even possible in Kigali. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali withdrew 
most of his Blue Helmet troops from Rwanda only a week ago. Now 
only around 270 are still there. Was that a mistake on the 
United Nation's part? 
  [Bicamumpaka] The withdrawal of the UN Blue Helmets was a 
very bad decision by the Security Council. Since 9 April, that 
is since the start of our transitional government, we officially 
asked that the Blue Helmets should on no account be reduced, on 
the contrary, we wanted more UN soldiers. We asked above all 
that the withdrawn Belgian contingent should be replaced by the 
UN Blue Helmets.
