<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Airport Flaps Down for Spring Festival"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing Capital International Airport has launched 
an all-out superior service campaign for Spring Festival. 
  Some 14,000 domestic and overseas travellers daily have 
transited the airport since the holiday season began January 20, 
a jump of 30 percent over regular usage. 
  The high-profile campaign spotlights resolute measures to 
guarantee ground security and flying safety-the biggest concern 
of the travelling public. 
  Approximately 300 security inspectors, using new X-ray 
machines and handheld metal detectors, are combing each 
passenger for any dangerous article. 
  The airport's 4,000 employees have pledged to improve 
service 
during the 40-day holiday period. 
  Their actions have included soliciting passenger opinions 
and 
advice through a poll conducted a few days ago. 
  The poll covered public facilities, environmental 
sanitation, 
shopping service, catering service and the security check. 
  Of the 300 travellers polled, 59.4 per cent said "very 
satisfactory," 32.1 per cent "satisfactory," and 8.5 per cent 
"discontented," particularly with catering and shopping service. 
  Travellers also suggested improving comprehensive service 
facilities in the waiting building, like more telephones and 
telegraph, more news stalls and detailed flight information.
