FT  13 DEC 93 / Scargill plans case against Labour
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, intends
to take legal action against the Labour party to try to prevent the
introduction of women-only shortlists for the selection of some of its
parliamentary candidates for the next general election, Robert Taylor
writes.
'I have not fought all my life against sexual discrimination to see one form
of discrimination replaced by another,' he says in a letter to a party
member revealed yesterday on BBC's On The Record programme.
A National Opinion Poll in the Labour party magazine New Century shows 61
per cent of people oppose all-women shortlists and only 28 per cent back
them.
