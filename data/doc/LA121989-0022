METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-RECORD PROMOTER GETS PROBATION IN PAYOLA 
CASE 
U.S. District Court Judge William J. Rea on Monday sentenced William Craig, a 
former independent record promoter, to five years' probation and 100 hours of 
community service and fined him $60,000 after his conviction on payola and tax 
evasion charges. 
Craig, 44, of Scottsdale, Ariz., was one of four people indicted on payola 
charges by a Los Angeles federal grand jury in February, 1988. At time of the 
indictment, then-U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner called it the nation's most 
significant payola case since the early 1970s. Craig, who pleaded guilty in 
October, had faced up to three years in prison for one count of failing to 
disclose payola payments and two counts of assisting in preparation of a false 
income tax return. But the prosecutor did not urge that he be imprisoned. 
Another defendant, Ralph Tashjian of San Mateo, was sentenced earlier this 
month to five years' probation and 500 hours of community service and was fined 
$100,000.
