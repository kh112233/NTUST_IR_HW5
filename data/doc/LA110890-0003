MAINSTREAMING HANDICAPPED SCHOOLCHILDREN 
While Sarah Englelmen fights for the right of her daughter to participate in 
"mainstream" education, two families in Hawaii are suing so their children will 
have the benefits of special education. 
As an educator, I am frustrated with the single-minded solutions that are 
pushed on school systems whenever the pendulum swings. 
The trend now is to mainstream. I support this trend if schools are allowed to 
prepare for this change and if parents of handicapped children are given an 
option. 
If mainstreaming is our goal and we want to provide quality education for all 
students, we would be wise to reduce the class size to a sensible 15 students. 
Mainstreaming might have a chance if we have small classes and prepared 
teachers. If we mainstream all students with special needs into the system we 
have now, everyone will lose.
