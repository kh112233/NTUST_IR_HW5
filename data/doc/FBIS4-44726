<F P=106> ["German-Saudi Arabian Research Project `Hysolar' Reports </F>
First Success"] 
  [Text] Stuttgart--The German-Saudi Arabian research project 
"Hysolar" has reported its first success. For the first time 
ever, in the Arabian desert, 40 kilometers northwest of the 
Saudi capital Riyadh, hydrogen has been produced technically in 
a procedure involving the direct coupling of solar power 
generation and the electrolysis of water. Researchers from the 
German Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) have been working on 
this project since 1986 at Stuttgart University with their Saudi 
colleagues from the King Abdulaziz City of Science and 
Technology (KACST) in Riyadh and the universities in Jeddah, 
Riyadh, and Dharan. 
  Gerd Eisenbeiss of the DLR, chairman of the German steering 
committee, called the start-up of the solar cell-powered, 
350-kilowatt-electrolysis plant in KACST's Solar Village a 
milestone. Eisenbeiss describes the accomplishment as follows: 
"The production of storable and transportable hydrogen is proof 
that a scenario incorporating solar power imports from the Sun 
belts of North Africa and Arabia is technically possible." 
  Studies relating to "Hysolar" prove that the hydrogen in 
future power supply systems having a highly regenerative power 
share can increase supply reliability. To be sure, the 
researchers admit frankly that solar hydrogen will only become 
economically attractive when the solar electricity required for 
the electrolysis process can be obtained substantially cheaper 
than it is today by means of photovoltaics and solar power 
plants, which utilize the concentrated sunlight thermally. 
  Eisenbeiss notes further that in order to optimize the 
entire 
system and to further develop the electrolysis technology, more 
work is needed. Unfortunately, financial support for the project 
is only assured until the end of 1995. Additional investments 
must follow after the DM76 million already granted. To this 
point, "Hysolar" has been financed half by Germany and half by 
Saudi Arabia. On the German side, the Federal Ministry for 
Research and Technology and the Baden Wuerttemberg Ministry for 
Science and Research share the costs. On the basis of the 
system's present still unsatisfactory 5% efficiency level, 
Saudi Arabia's "solar resources" could, were solar power 
utilized ideally on only 1% of its land surface, deliver 
the 
same amount of energy that is currently exported yearly as 
petroleum. The researchers are certain that in several years 
more advanced photovoltaic electrolysis plants could reach an 
average efficiency level of 10%. "But," Eisenbeiss 
concludes, 
"we shall never reach a price of five pfennigs a kilowatt as is 
the case for natural gas."
