CONFRONTATION AT TUSTIN'S ABORTION CLINIC 
The Times article on the July 8 confrontation at the Tustin abortion clinic 
(July 9) contained misleading statements, such as: "Nearly 1,000 anti-abortion 
activists and pro-choice advocates taunted one another," and "Overall, the 
Tustin demonstration was largely nonviolent, although tempers flared and a few 
people reported minor injuries from shoving matches." 
Of these estimated 1,000 participants, only 150 to 200 were anti-choice (it was 
easy enough to figure out who was on which side). The shoving did not result 
from flaring tempers, nor was it incidental. It resulted from Operation 
Rescue's calculated strategy of trying to push the clinic defenders out of the 
way in order to take their place and close the clinic, and from the pro-choice 
group's concerted refusal to be pushed aside.
