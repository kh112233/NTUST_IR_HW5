SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Police used a Taser gun to subdue a man Thursday night in Southeast San Diego 
after he threatened to kill them, authorities said. 
The man, King Fung Chu, 40, of San Diego, was stopped by officers about 10:20 
p.m. while driving a car with its anti-theft alarm blaring, police said. 
The car, which wasn't stolen, was traveling west on Home Avenue near California 
94, police said. 
When two officers approached Chu after stopping the car, he was uncooperative 
and shouted: "I'm going to kill an American cop. Shoot me, shoot me," said 
police spokesman Dave Cohen. 
Police summoned a backup unit with a police dog, Cohen said. 
The dog was used by officers to distract Chu on the driver's side of the car 
while an unidentified officer broke the car's right window and fired the Taser 
gun at Chu, Cohen said. 
The gun fires a dart that emits 50,000 volts of electricity, Cohen said. 
Chu, who was stunned by the dart and bitten on the left arm by the dog, was 
taken to San Diego Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital where he was treated. He 
was transferred to County Mental Health for 72 hours of observation, Cohen 
said.
