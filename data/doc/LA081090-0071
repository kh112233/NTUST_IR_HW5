SPANISH GALLEON FOUND, TREASURE HUNTERS SAY 
Treasure hunters have found what they believe are the remains of a gold- and 
silver-laden Spanish galleon sunk by pirates in 1792 in the River Plate's muddy 
waters off the Uruguayan capital's coast. 
Ruben Collado, an Argentine who heads a team of 15 divers searching for the 
galleon El Preciado, told reporters Thursday that he had located the spot where 
the ship went down.
