FT  30 DEC 94 / Saunders upbeat over appeal
Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman jailed for his role in the
1986 takeover of Distillers, yesterday expressed confidence that his
convictions for theft and false accounting would be overturned.
He welcomed the decision by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to refer
the cases of himself and the three other City figures convicted over the
affair to the Court of Appeal.
Mr Saunders told BBC Radio the Guinness trial was an 'over the top' and
'politically expedient' prosecution driven by the government's desire to
tackle 'so-called white-collar crime'. He denied reports that he had
suffered from Alzheimer's disease. His release from prison after serving 10
months of a 2 1/2 -year sentence was in line with all prisoners who received
full remission for good behaviour, he said.
The appeals of Mr Saunders, Mr Gerald Ronson, the property developer, Mr
Anthony Parnes, the former stockbroker and the businessman Mr Jack Lyons
will be heard next year.
