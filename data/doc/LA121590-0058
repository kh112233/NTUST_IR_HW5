QUOTA ON SOVIET JEWS; 
WORLD IN BRIEF 
Germany proposed Friday to set a tight quota on the immigration of Soviet Jews, 
accepting as few as 1,000 a year despite tens of thousands of applications. 
According to spokesmen, the interior ministers of the 16 German states, meeting 
in Dresden, were nearly unanimous in support of the limit.
