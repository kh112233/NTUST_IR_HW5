FLOAT BRINGS CALL FOR AUDIT OF RIDE-SHARING PROGRAM 
Following disclosures that $100,000 is being invested in a parade float to 
promote ride-sharing, transportation officials ordered an internal audit Monday 
of the entire ride-sharing program to see if there were any more questionable 
expenditures. 
Jim Drago, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation, 
confirmed that the audit of the $8.4-million program was requested by J. F. 
Maloney, the agency's chief deputy director, to determine "if all the money is 
being spent properly." 
"Any time the merits of any program are questioned, as a matter of routine we 
would go back and look at it," he said. "We want to know if the money is being 
spent as intended to promote ride-sharing." 
Caltrans has been criticized by several legislators, including the chairmen of 
both the Senate and Assembly transportation committees, for a decision to spend 
$100,000 on a float for the Tournament of Roses Parade. The float, depicting 
magical characters, encourages motorists to do their part to help unclog 
highways by sharing rides. 
Drago said the state would continue with the float project. 
Caltrans' $100,000 investment covers half the cost of the float. The rest is 
being met by other government agencies and private companies. 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) called the $100,000 expenditure "ill-timed" 
because he said it gave the impression that Caltrans did not know how to spend 
additional gas tax money approved by the voters in June. By approving 
Proposition 111, voters endorsed a phased-in, 9-cents per gallon gasoline tax 
increase. 
"On Dec. 1, fuel taxes (increased) another 5 cents per gallon nationally, and 
on Jan. 1, 1991, the state fuel tax rate will increase another penny a gallon," 
Katz wrote to Caltrans. "The first and most visible use of those new revenues 
will be a parade float. That's not what the voters expected when they approved 
Proposition 111."
