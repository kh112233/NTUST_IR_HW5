  [Text] Lu Kang, a senior journalist [fomerly of Hong 
Kong], held that the Xi Yang incident was not an affair only 
concerning Xi Yang alone; nor was it an affair only concerning 
MING PAO. Instead, it was an affair concerning the future of 
Hong Kong's mass media as a whole. So it must not be taken 
lightly. 
  He proposed that the mass media in Hong Kong should stand up 
to argue strongly on just grounds against the Beijing 
authorities, because news freedom is not something being 
bestowed by the authorities but something that people must 
strive for on their own. 
  Lu Kang revealed that according to sources in Beijing, the 
CPC authorities originally did not intend to severely punish Xi 
Yang, but Vice Premier Zhu Rongji strongly demanded that stern 
punishment be meted out to Xi Yang, because Zhu had to establish 
his personal authority while his macro-control policy 
encountered resistance from various quarters. Thus, the case of 
news coverage turned into a political case. Lu Kang pointed out 
that such behavior of haphazardly changing the law according to 
the will of an individual leader was never favorable to the 
nation and was extremely wrong. Zhu Rongji himself also made an 
extremely bad impression on the public.
