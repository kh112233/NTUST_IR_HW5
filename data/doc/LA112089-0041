3RD EX-OFFICER BACKS DEATH SQUAD REPORT 
A dispute over the existence of an official South African death squad gathered 
momentum when a third policeman alleged that the squad killed anti-apartheid 
leaders between 1980 and 1982. The Johannesburg Sunday Times said former police 
constable David Tshikalange, a black man, admitted in an interview that he 
helped kill black civil rights lawyer Griffiths Mxenge in 1981. Tshikalange's 
claims supported charges by former police Capt. Johannes Coetzee, who left the 
country after telling the liberal Afrikaans-language weekly Vrye Weekblad that 
he headed an official police death squad.
