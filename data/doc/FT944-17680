FT  07 OCT 94 / Estline's Swedish partner quits
The future of Estline, the Estonian-Swedish shipping line which operated the
doomed car ferry Estonia, was thrown into doubt last night when Nordstrom &amp;
Thulin, the Swedish half-owner of the company, announced it was pulling out
of passenger shipping following last week's disaster. The decision is a
further blow to the Estonian nation, already reeling from the catastrophe.
The state owns the other 50 per cent of Estline through the Estonian
Shipping Company.
Estline, which has a 10-year monopoly concession on the Stockholm-Tallinn
route, played a prestigious and important role in the economic development
of Estonia after the country won its independence from Moscow in 1991.
Nordstrom &amp; Thulin said it would seek a solution that allowed Estline to
continue in operation, but did not make clear how this would be done. The
Swedish company, which mainly operates tankers and bulk carriers, also
apologised for its initial public reaction to the disaster, which claimed
more than 900 lives when the Estonia sank in the Baltic Sea. Mr Ronald
Bergman, Nordstrom &amp; Thulin's managing director, asked for forgiveness for
the company's initial statement that it would not be financially hit because
it had full insurance cover and that the accident would not stop a
profitable business venture.
