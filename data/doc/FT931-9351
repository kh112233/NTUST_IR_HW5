FT  15 FEB 93 / Wave of violence in Algeria
RADICAL Islamic groups in Algeria have stepped up confrontation with the
security forces with a series of weekend attacks.
General Khaled Nezzar, defence minister and key figure in the five-man
presidency, narrowly escaped assassination on Saturday when a car bomb
exploded as he drove past.
Fundamentalists yesterday attacked a minibus carrying children of members of
the security forces to school in Algiers, wounding the driver.
At least 600 members of the security forces have been killed in the past 12
months, including four policemen in Algiers on Saturday.
The attempted killing of the defence minister came less than two days after
execution of four fundamentalists for an attack on army barracks.
Gen Nezzar has tried to hold a middle course between senior members of the
armed and security forces who want a firm line against Moslem groups and
those officers more inclined to conciliation. Mr Michel Sapin, French
finance minister, has offered Algeria FFr6bn (Pounds 752m) worth of tied
credits for 1993.
