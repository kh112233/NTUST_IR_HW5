TEXAS; 
DEATH ROW INMATE'S CONVICTION SET ASIDE 
A Texas appeals court set aside the conviction of Death Row inmate Clarence Lee 
Brandley, more than two years after a judge ruled the black man was unfairly 
tried in the slaying of a white teen-ager. Brandley, 38, spent nearly nine 
years on Death Row. He was convicted of the 1980 strangulation and rape of a 
teen-ager at Conroe High School, where Brandley was a janitor. The court said 
the state's investigation of the slaying led to a trial that lacked "the 
rudiments of fairness" and ordered Brandley released to the custody of the 
Montgomery County sheriff for a possible new trial.
