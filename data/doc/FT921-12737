FT  24 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Unions attack 'loopholes' in rules for
use of VDUs
HEALTH and safety rules covering an estimated 7m workers using visual
display units (VDUs) were issued yesterday and were immediately attacked by
trade unions and environmental health officers.
Unions said the rules provided too many loopholes for employers and failed
to meet the requirements of a European Community directive.
The Institution of Environmental Health Officers said the regulations might
lead safety inspectors to spend too much time visiting offices and
neglecting more dangerous premises.
The new rules, published in a consultation document by the Health and Safety
Executive, cover the design of desks and chairs as well as the provision of
work breaks and eye tests for VDU workers.
The TUC said the proposed regulations would not meet EC standards. Mr Alan
Tuffin, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union and chairman of
the TUC's health and safety committee, said the TUC would lobby unions
throughout the EC on the issue. Mr Tuffin is also a commissioner on the
Health and Safety Commission.
Unions say thousands of VDU workers will be excluded because the definition
of a regular user is too narrow. They also say the proposals would not
entitle all VDU workers to a full eye test.
