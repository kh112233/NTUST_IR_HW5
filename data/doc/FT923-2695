FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (8): A significant boost for tourism - 'The
garden festival factor' helps to attract visitors
THE WALES Tourist Board is calling it 'the garden festival factor.' Hotel
and guest houses bookings in Wales were 2 per cent up in July, compared with
last year, as against a decline of 6 per cent in England and a 2 per cent
fall in Scotland, according to the most recently published figures.
Paul Loveluck, chief executive of the WTB, is in no doubt that the
government-backed annual Garden Festival, located this year at Ebbw Vale in
the south Wales valleys, has given a significant boost to Welsh tourism
activity and helped shield sections of the industry from the worst of the
recession.
The festival has been huge success. Despite the weather - rainfall in August
was 81 per cent above average - it is well on its way towards meeting its
target of 2m visitors. Hotels and guest houses in south and mid Wales were
reporting a 6 per cent increase in occupancy in July, whereas in north Wales
the figures were indicating a 6 per cent drop in bookings, Mr Loveluck
explains.
Tourism has long been a key component of the Welsh economy. During the 1980s
it assumed even greater importance, as employment in Wales' traditional
industries contracted. These days the industry generates a total revenue of
about Pounds 1.3bn annually, and supports about 95,000 jobs, or 9 per cent
of all employment in Wales. Between 1982 and 1987, tourism created an
average of about 1,500 jobs per annum.
In 1990, the number of visits to Wales by domestic tourists fell back
sharply to 8.3m from 9.4m the previous year. However, last year there was a
recovery to 8.7m visits, on top of which there were some 640,000 overseas
visitors who spent an estimated Pounds 130m, and an estimated 32m leisure
trips by day visitors whose expenditure is calculated at around Pounds 229m.
As these figures indicate, the Wales tourist industry has clearly not
escaped the effects of the recession. In particular, outside the hotels and
guest-house sector, the signs are that things are getting worse.
During June, holiday caravan park bookings fell sharply by a worrying 14 per
cent. The number of visitors to tourist attractions was also 10 per cent
down during the same month from 1.26m to 1.16m. In terms of volume, the
recession is catching up with us, Mr Loveluck admits.
However, he stresses that at this stage the industry is neither alarmed nor
downhearted. To start with, the drop in visitors to traditional tourist
attractions is due in part to the fact that many end-of-term school trips
which normally boost visitor numbers in June, were this year diverted to the
garden festival.
But the garden festival promises also to have a beneficial effect long-term.
Some 70 per cent of visitors to Ebbw Vale said they intended coming back to
Wales. Information on these visitors is being incorporated into the WTB's
data- base for use in future marketing campaigns.
Second, the industry has been enjoying good levels of investment. Since June
1988, grants and loans awarded by the WTB under section 4 of the 1969
Tourism Act have generated a total of some Pounds 120m in capital investment
projects designed to improve the quality and range of Wales's tourist
facilities.
Third, the Welsh Office has authorised the Board to step up investment
incentives in the farmhouse and guesthouse sector, with a view to
maintaining capital investment improvements in the recession. Some Pounds
1.25m has been earmarked for enhanced capital grants over the next 18
months. The average rate of grant will be 30 per cent of project cost, but
up to 50 per cent will be available towards the cost of electronic equipment
necessary for today's successful tourist business, such as computers, faxes,
and telephone answering machines. This scheme was announced in July and the
number of enquiries is already been encouraging.
A fourth ground for optimism is the success of Wales's Welcome Host scheme.
Welcome Host is a network of 70 trainers who offer a one day training module
to assist whole communities to make visitors to Wales feel more welcome.
The idea originated in British Colombia in 1986 as the Super Host scheme at
the Vancouver Expo. It crossed the Pacific to become New Zealand's Kiwi Host
scheme, but Wales is the first country in Europe to introduce this new idea
in customer care.
Aimed at all who come into contact with visitors, the beneficiaries of the
Welcome Host training programme include the staff at Garden Festival Wales,
some 200 Cardiff taxi drivers and staff of the Midland Bank in Wales.
Marks and Spencer is among the companies which are about to sign up on
behalf of their staff. Such has been the interest in the scheme, the WTB is
planning to hold a seminar later this year to explain its principles to
organisations from other parts of the UK. In the meantime, the WTB has made
attendance on a Welcome Host course a condition of any financial assistance.
Fifth, the Welsh Office has made an extra Pounds 2.5m a year available over
the next three years to increase the WTB's marketing activities. Some Pounds
1.7m of the total is earmarked for image building in the north-west,
Midlands, M4 corridor and the south-east.
Using both poster and TV advertising, the board's campaign will highlight
Wales's striking scenery, peace and tranquility, and easy paced
sophistication. It will be particularly aimed at those people who do not at
present put Wales on their holiday shopping list.
One of the strengths of the Welsh tourist industry is that it has a very
loyal customer base. Visitors come back time and again for their holidays.
And response rates from recent marketing campaigns have been exceptionally
good. The board commissioned a tracking survey in 1990 and established that
45 per cent of people who asked for a copy of its holiday brochure
subsequently came to Wales for a holiday.
In these circumstances, there will be no let up in the board's direct mail
effort. The board has 1.5m names on its direct mail data-base and is
continually adding to it by buying in fresh data, confident that it knows
enough about the Wales tourist industry's customer profile to improve its
response rate.
Last but not least, the decision of the government to grant the Wales
Tourist Board the same overseas marketing powers as the Scottish Tourist
Board is also a welcome boost for the industry. The board intends to
continue working in close co-operation with the British Tourist Board.
However, the new powers will enable the board, for example, to work in
cooperation with the Welsh Development Agency on joint promotions.
A start is being made this autumn when the two organisations take advantage
of a concert tour by the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra to Paris, Amsterdam
and Brussels, to promote the virtues of Wales for both business and pleasure
in three key European markets.
