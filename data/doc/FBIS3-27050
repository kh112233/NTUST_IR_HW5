  [Text] The Hebei acrylonitrile-acrylic fiber project, a key 
project for the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, was officially 
approved for planning by the State Planning Commission. 
  The Hebei acrylonitrile-acrylic fiber project, which is to 
be 
built by Hebei and the China Petrochemical Corporation, is the 
after-process project of the Hebei ethylene project. Five units 
of equipment to produce 50,000 tonnes of acrylonitrile, 30,000 
tonnes of acrylic fibers, 6,000 tonnes of ammonium sulfide, 
2,000 tonnes of refined acetonitrile, and 10,000 tonnes of 
sodium cyanide a year will be built. Investment totals about 
1.6 billion yuan. After completed, this project will be able to 
yield fairly good economic benefits, earning more than 600 
million yuan from sales and creating more than 200 million yuan 
of profits and taxes a year. Construction of this project may 
effectively promote Hebei's textile industry and adjust its mix 
of textile goods. It will also play an important role in 
changing Hebei's long reliance on others for the supply of 
synthetic fibers and for saving foreign exchange. The 
feasibility study for this project is being stepped up and 
efforts will be made to start its construction early.
