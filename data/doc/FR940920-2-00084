SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA recognizes that many women needing or wanting breast implants would like to have a safe and effective alternative
to breast prostheses containing silicone. In addition, potential manufacturers of these medical devices would
like to know the agency's views on testing requirements for alternative breast implants intended for reconstruction
and/or augmentation. The purpose of the scientific workshop is to provide a forum for FDA to present draft guidance
concerning alternative breast prostheses testing requirements. Among the major topics planned for discussion
are developments in biomaterials, chemical characterization of materials, mechanical testing, preclinical biological
testing, clinical testing, quality of life considerations, requirements for investigational device exemptions
and premarket approval applications, and postmarket-epidemiological issues. The workshop will include discussion
and an exchange of information by invited scientific authorities.
