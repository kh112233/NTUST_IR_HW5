FT  06 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Setback for Cuba in push for investors
A CUBAN government effort to lure foreign investors has suffered a setback
with Havana's decision to discontinue work on a nuclear power plant for
which it was getting technical and financial help from the former Soviet
Union.
Havana had repeatedly said the plant was able to provide adequate power for
new industrial and commercial ventures on the island, ending the energy
shortage which has crippled economic life.
Cuba's oil supplies have fallen sharply since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, its main source of petroleum products. President Fidel Castro has
said the decision to suspend work was temporary. Russia had been making
unacceptable demands on Cuba for support in completing the plant.
The differences, say diplomats, centred on Russia's decision that its
contribution should be on a commercial basis. The Cubans were uncertain
about access to fuel for the plant. It is unlikely any other country will
offer to complete the project.
With Cuba's domestic oil output at only 5 per cent of the 10m tonnes it
needs each year, Havana will be pressed to convince prospective investors
the island represents a viable business location without the power station.
The plant, at Jurugua in Cienfuegos Province, has been frequently delayed by
technical problems. It was based on four 417MW reactors, but was planned to
start with two reactors two years ago.
The decision to suspend construction is likely to be greeted with relief by
Cuba's Caribbean neighbours. Claims by defecting Cuban scientists that it
was unsafe had forced several Caribbean governments to raise questions about
the effect on the region of a nuclear accident in the wake of the disaster
at a similar plant in Chernobyl. The Cubans denied their plant was faulty
and invited foreign experts to examine it.
