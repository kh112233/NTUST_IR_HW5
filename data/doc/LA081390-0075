SKIN CANCER SCREENING RESULTS DRAMATIZE SUN HAZARD, UCI DOCTORS SAY 
Some people in Orange County are apparently not listening: Too much sun is not 
good for you. Sun worshipers who frolic on the county's beaches without 
protection from the glare of cloudless skies may very likely get skin cancer. 
Doctors at UC Irvine's Melanoma Center say they know they sound like a broken 
record, but they figure many outdoors types in this county are still not paying 
attention. And now they have more evidence of that. 
During a skin cancer screening offered by the center during April and May, 1 of 
every 5 persons was diagnosed with skin cancer, while almost a third had 
precancerous lesions -- numbers that alarmed some doctors and others at the 
center. 
"We were really amazed at what we saw," said Leslie Ann Cyril, a spokesperson 
for the center. "Melanomas are being discovered in much younger people. That's 
what's so surprising." 
Dr. Matthew Goodman, co-director of the melanoma center, cautioned that these 
results are not an accurate measure of skin cancer prevalence among the general 
population, nor was this meant as a scientific study. The 175 people who were 
screened, he said, probably likely suspected they might have a problem with 
skin abnormalities, including skin cancer. However, he said, results of this 
screening echo trends in national studies showing that skin cancer is on the 
rise, especially among people who live in sunny Southern California. 
"It reiterates the need to use good judgment in our sun habits and the use of a 
sun screen with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of 15 or greater," he said. "It 
shows that it could happen to you." 
He also said it is an indication that there is still a great need for better 
educational programs warning about the dangers of the sun in this county of 
sunny beaches and endless summers. The melanoma center, which opened in 1986 at 
the UCI Clinical Cancer Center and is the only such center in Orange County, 
has started some educational programs for elementary school children, Cyril 
said. 
The American Cancer Society estimates that 60,000 people will develop skin 
cancer during 1990, a 4% increase from last year. Of those, 27,600 will be 
diagnosed with melanoma, the most serious form, and the Cancer Society 
estimates that 6,300 people will die from melanoma this year. 
That is why Matthews said he could not overstate the need for caution and 
prevention. The cancer center plans to offer another screening in the fall, he 
said, and he encouraged people in Orange County, especially those who engage in 
outdoor activity, to get themselves checked out. 
"In my opinion it is related to the popularity of the masses going to the beach 
and other outdoor recreation as much as they have in the last few years, almost 
to a fanatic extreme," he said. "Well, don't say fanatic extreme, because I 
think outdoor recreation is great and good. But people should be prudent." 
But Dore Gilbert, a Newport Beach dermatologist, said he thinks people living 
along the coast are well-informed about the dangers of overexposure. The higher 
incidence of skin cancer and melanoma cases, he said, could reflect an 
increased awareness among people who are seeking medical help earlier, before 
it is too late. 
"In this area, in Orange County and also in Los Angeles, people are very aware 
of melanoma," he said. "If you get out to more rural areas, areas away from the 
coast, you are going to find more people who say, 'It can't happen to me.' " 
Those, he said, are the people to worry about.
