FT  29 SEP 93 / Jordan to hold vote on time despite PLO-Israel deal
JORDAN will hold its first multi-party elections for parliament since 1956
as planned on 8 November, Mr Abdul Salam al-Majali, prime minister, said
yesterday.
King Hussein had told foreign correspondents at a private dinner over the
weekend that 'there is a likelihood of a postponement for a limited period
of time' because he did not wish the election to become a referendum on the
peace deal between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Mr Majali denied that there had been any change of tack but said that the
government had listened to debate within the country and decided there was
no need for postponement. 'We had all sorts of calls from all sorts of
places but there's been no change from our side. Everything will be held on
time,' he told the Financial Times.
His comments, however, come as a surprise to most people in Amman, and
western diplomats voiced scepticism over whether the decision is final. 'The
king has been under a lot of pressure from those for and against having
elections on time and I don't think this is the last word,' said one.
The PLO-Israeli deal had thrown Jordan's election plans into a state of
confusion over whether hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be
eligible to vote in July's elections in the occupied territories in addition
to the Jordanian poll.
The king had told the correspondents that he hoped Jordan's elections would
be held within 'a few months' or at the same time as elections under the
Palestinian-Israeli agreement.
Political parties welcomed the government's decision. 'It is good for our
democracy,' said one parliamentary candidate from the fundamentalist party,
the Islamic Action Front, which was against any postponment.
