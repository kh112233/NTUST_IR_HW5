<F P=106> [Article signed AdG: "`False Bomb Threat Was Work of </F>
Spanish Secret Service' -- ETA Suspects Deny Any Responsibility"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels -- Luis Moreno and Raquel Garcia, the 
two ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty] suspects who applied for 
political asylum in Belgium to no avail, heard the news of the 
bomb threat via Spanish television in their flat in Brussels. 
Moreno and Garcia are certain the threats are the work of 
infiltrators from the Spanish secret service. Earlier this 
month the couple appealed against the Belgian decision to not 
recognize them as political refugees. [passage omitted] 
  "They [the Spanish secret service] want to make the life of 
the Belgian Government so difficult it has to deport us from the 
country," they said. "But we know better. If the ETA is 
planning an attack, then it does so through its own channels. 
At the bottom of the threatening letter they always put the 
standard round stamp with the logo of the independence movement. 
Not some Arab signature or other." [passage omitted]
