FT  20 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Turning full circle at the
power station - Europe's first energy plant fuelled by old tyres has opened
in Britain
Most vehicles in Britain are not just running on four wheels but on a
potential energy resource - tyres - which an innovative power company has
begun burning to generate electricity.
The idea of burning tyres raises images of noxious fumes and black smoke,
but Elm Energy, a US joint venture, has won permission to open Europe's
first power station in Britain, fuelled by Michelins, Goodyears, Pirellis
and other makes.
An intensive lobbying campaign by the company has convinced regulators and
local authorities not only that drivers' last punctured tyres may be
consigned safely to the furnace, but that a stringent recycling system will
ensure they will not then inhale the by-products.
Standing outside Elm Energy's newly completed power station in
Wolverhampton, which has its formal opening early in November, Anne Evans,
the managing director, claims the recycling facility will out-perform other
waste-to-energy schemes.
An average tyre, she says, contains the equivalent energy of 12 cu m of
natural gas and is second only to oil in British Thermal Units (BTU), the
common measure of heat energy produced during incineration.
Following the completion of pre-production tests at the plant, truck loads
of old tyres are being fed into five giant furnaces where they will burn at
up to 950`C. Elm Energy expects to generate heat energy of 13,500 BTU per
pound, compared with 12,000 BTU for coal, 2,500 BTU for household rubbish
and 1,500 BTU for food waste.
Burning tyres is hot work and could easily produce the steam to drive a
turbine.
Elm Energy's success has rested on citing similar operations in the US where
the tyre industry can dispose of its rubbish at one end of a power station
and see no harmful gases emerge at the other.
The company - formed by Nipsco, the Indiana utility group, and the
Performance Service Corporation of Connecticut - has pioneered a system
which it claims will consume 21 per cent of Britain's waste tyres with
minimal emissions.
That claim is based on its unique power generation and recycling process.
Under the system, batches of tyres are rammed into furnaces, where all the
material is expected to burn so rapidly that almost no carbon gases can
form. Split-level hearths in the furnace will, meanwhile, pulsate along a
series of steps so that the ash - mostly steel wire - can be fed into
hoppers for recycling to the scrap metal industry.
Before reaching the next stage, where furnace gases flow around water-filled
drums to produce turbine-driving steam, any remaining organic material is
incinerated in reburn tunnels fed with combustion air. Having produced
enough energy for 30MW of electricity - supplying 25,000 homes - the tyres'
job is done.
If the remaining gases were pumped straight into the atmosphere,
environmentalists would have justifiable complaint. But Elm Energy says its
recycling means that emissions of harmful substances will be less than
one-millionth of the World Health Organisation limits.
First, the flue gases are filtered through hundreds of Gore-Tex bags to
extract zinc oxide. The company plans to sell this waste to the tyre
industry for re-use in new products.
Remaining waste gases flow into a lime reactor which converts harmful
sulphur dioxide into calcium sulphite. At the final stage, the sulphite will
be filtered through another series of Gore-Tex bags and the residue sold for
building materials.
'There will be no black smoke, no environmental problem,' predicts Evans.
'If this plant isn't clean enough then you cannot build anything in the UK.'
She may be right. But all this technology costs money and the government,
determined to encourage alternatives to coal, has underwritten the scheme.
Elm Energy's initial contracts with the Non Fossil Fuel Agency, which
purchases the power and resells it to Midlands Electricity company, are
confidential.
Evans says these contracts would be withdrawn if she revealed their value.
All she will admit is that the government has guaranteed the company's
short-term contracts, so helping the company to borrow the capital to set up
the plant.
More than Pounds 48m has been invested in the Wolverhampton plant and Elm
Energy is confident of a handsome return.
That income has a double bonus: on the one hand, the government wants to
promote waste-to-energy schemes; on the other, the tyre industry is keener
to see its tyres go into power generation than landfill sites.
Elm Energy says its operation will be cheaper than other waste-fuelled power
schemes because there will not be tonnes of burnt ash to dispose of.
The company is so certain it can provide energy at the right price that it
is already planning further plants in Scotland, southern England and
continental Europe.
In Wolverhampton, Evans says people have the right attitude: 'They're not
afraid of tyres.'
