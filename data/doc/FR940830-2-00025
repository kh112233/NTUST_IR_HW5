 

The least-cost strategy will provide a list of policy options that, when implemented, could meet the goals and reflect
the priorities outlined in Section 1602 of EPAct. The least-cost strategy will call upon available and anticipated
resources and technologies to satisfy final energy demands at minimum long-run cost, subject to these goals and priorities.
Section 1602(a) lists the following goals: 
&bull;Stabilization and eventual reduction in the generation of greenhouse gases 
&bull;An increase in the efficiency of the Nation's total energy use by 30 percent over 1988 levels by 2010 
&bull;An increase in the percentage of energy derived from renewable resources by 75 percent over 1988 levels by the
year 2005
&bull;A reduction in the nation's oil consumption from the 1990 level of approximately 40 percent of total energy
use to 35 percent by the year 2005.
&bull;In addition, Section 1602(d) lists the following energy production, utilization, and energy conservation
priorities: 
&bull;Implement standards for more efficient use of fossil fuels; 
&bull;Increase the energy efficiency of existing technologies; 
&bull;Encourage technologies, including clean coal technologies, that generate lower levels of greenhouse gases;

&bull;Promote the use of renewable energy resources, including solar, geothermal, and sustainable biomass, hydropower,
and wind power; 
&bull;Affect the development and consumption of energy and energy efficiency resources and electricity through
tax policy; 
&bull;Encourage investment in energy efficient equipment and technologies; and 
&bull;Encourage the development of energy technologies, such as advanced nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, that
produce energy without greenhouse gases as a byproduct, and encourage the deployment of nuclear electric generating
capacity. 


II. Content of the Energy Resources and Technology Inventory 


Section 1602(b) of EPAct requires an inventory of energy resources and technology. Conservation technologies,
which reduce the amount of energy required to provide a given energy service, are considered as energy technologies
for purposes of this inventory. 
As part of the inventory, known and anticipated primary energy inputs will be inventoried. These include coal, oil
and gas (both domestic and imported), renewable sources (including diverse solar forms, biomass, wind and ocean
energy, hydro, geothermal, and municipal waste methane), nuclear, hydrogen, and synthetic fuels and coal gases.
