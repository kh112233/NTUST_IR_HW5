FT  16 FEB 94 / Burma junta refuses to free Suu Kyi
Burma's military junta yesterday brushed off international appeals for the
release of opposition leader Ms Aung San Suu Kyi and threatened to keep her
under house arrest until 1995.
'She has been told that her house arrest will extend to next year,' Col Kyaw
Win, a senior intelligence officer in the State Law and Order Restoration
Council (Slorc), told Japanese journalists in Rangoon.
His statement came a day after Ms Suu Kyi was visited at her Rangoon home by
US congressman Mr William Richardson, together with a New York Times
reporter and a UN official - the first visit by people other than her family
since she was held nearly five years ago.
The Oxford-educated Ms Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, has
refused to leave the country in exchange for her release.
'Whatever they do to me, I can take it,' she told the New York Times. She
said the junta 'had tried to pressure me to leave in ways no self-respecting
government should try.'
The international standing of Ms Suu Kyi, her popularity within Burma and
her continued defiance are an embarrassment to the junta. Most other
democracy campaigners have been killed, jailed, driven out of the country or
browbeaten into submission.
Ms Suu Kyi is a beacon of hope for pro-democracy activists as they watch the
junta engineer a new constitution that would allow the armed forces to
continue running the country from behind the scenes.
The armed forces have held power since 1962. They crushed a popular uprising
in 1988 and allowed an election two years later which - to their discomfit -
was won convincingly by Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. The
junta ignored the result and suppressed all forms of dissent, but is now
trying to convince Japan and other countries to renew aid.
Col Kyaw Win said yesterday Ms Suu Kyi would 'interfere with politics and
create unrest' if she were set free within Burma. Ms Suu Kyi has challenged
the junta to respect the results of the election.
