  [Abstract] 96 children (52 girls and 44 boys), one to seven 
years old, were examined during the aggravation of the 
ecological situation in the Central rayon of the city of Bratsk 
at the beginning of 1991. The ecological situation was 
aggravated by accumulation, due to calm weather, of industrial 
emissions of a timber industrial complex,aluminum smelting plant 
and thermoelectric power plant. The article calls the situation 
an ``ecologic explosion''. The obtained data were compared to 
the data of a similar 1990examination of 82 children (41 girls 
and a boy) in the same age group, when the air situation was 
relatively safe. Protein, carbohydrate and lipoid metabolisms, 
peroxidelipoid oxidation (PLO) processes, the activity of 
antiradical enzymes (catalase andperoxidase) and peroxide 
erythrocyte resistance (PER) were studied. The detected 
metabolic responses in preschool children during the especially 
unfavorable ecologicalsituation indicate a considerable strain 
of their homeostasis. The concentration of malone dialdehyde, an 
end product of PLO, in blood plasma and erythrocytes 
hadincreased, while the activity of antiradical enzymes 
(catalase and peroxidase decreased. The described children's 
metabolic responses demonstrate functionally unfavorable changes 
and the possibility of transformation of adaptation-adjustment 
responses during initial stages of pathological conditions.
