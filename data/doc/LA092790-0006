USING ABORTED TISSUE IN RESEARCH 
Corbett's column portrays big medicine as a caring industry that, if unchained 
from the grips of right-wing ideology, would save us from many diseases. She 
also writes of "miracles" by using fetal tissue to lengthen the lives of 
Parkinson's disease sufferers. 
All this would be wonderful stuff if we were a species who lived in harmony 
with the others that inhabit the planet. But the facts are that humans have 
dominated, raped and plundered just about everything we have touched or could 
see. 
Any attempts to extend our lives consist of nothing more than humankind's 
egotistical quest for immortality and big medicine, i.e., big business, 
capitalizing on that, sensing money to be made. I urge everyone facing the 
potential of a degenerative fatal disease to make his peace with his God, his 
loved ones and himself, and leave life in a dignified and as untechnical a way 
as he came into the world. That in my eyes would truly be a miracle.
