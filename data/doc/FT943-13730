FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (14): Biggest splash so far / Profile
of P W V province
In the legislature of the PWV province - the industrial hub of South Africa,
rather inelegantly named for its three main centres, Pretoria, the
Witwatersrand and Vereeniging - the spirit of provincial unity is so strong
that National Party members shout 'Amandla', the black power salute, and the
African National Congress shouts 'hoor, hoor', the traditional Afrikaans
interjection - just to show willing, writes Patti Waldmeir.
It is an impressive display, led by Mr Tokyo Sexwale, the premier - a man
who proved his conciliatory credentials last year when he pleaded for racial
tolerance in the aftermath of the assassination of Chris Hani, the ANC
guerrilla leader killed by a right-wing white assassin.
True to form as South Africa's most powerful province, the PWV and its
leaders have made the biggest splash so far on the provincial scene.
Hardly a day passes but Mr Sexwale, or Miss Jessie Duarte, his diminutive
police minister, visit a black township to urge residents to co-operate with
police, or drop in on a migrant workers' hostel to try to foster peace.
Mr Sexwale's performance as premier will be judged largely by how well he
implements the reconstruction and development programme. And here, conflicts
are already looming.
In his inaugural speech to the new legislature, Mr Sexwale promised to build
150,000 houses in the province over the next year - compared with only
30,000 homes built throughout South Africa last year.
He is understood to have plans for a grand R4bn house-building project
involving massive private and public sector finance. The plan has already
caused friction with Mr Joe Slovo, national housing minister, but Mr Slovo
appears to have been powerless to prevent it.
Mr Sexwale's youthful and inexperienced cabinet - which includes a finance
minister who is regional general secretary of the South African Communist
party and other noted radicals - certainly does not lack energy.
Only time will tell whether it lacks the circumspection necessary to avoid
grand and costly development failures.
