FT  05 JUL 93 / Weekend violence erupts in Belfast
POLICE and fire crews came under attack yesterday as the weekend of violence
in Belfast continued. The civil unrest, which flared after the funeral on
Friday of Ulster Volunteer Force terrorist Brian McCallum - who accidentally
killed himself with his own grenade - was Ulster's worst for years, police
said.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, interrupted his weekend to
fly back to the city, where he condemned the 'cowardly' attacks.
An RUC spokesman said several people, including three police officers, were
injured during seven hours of 'serious public disorder' overnight.
The most serious rioting was in parts of south and north Belfast.
The overnight violence followed 15 hours of unrest during Friday and early
Saturday when RUC officers were the targets of a wave of gun and grenade
attacks, for which the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters claimed
responsibility.
