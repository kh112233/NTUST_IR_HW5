WORLD IN BRIEF; 
EUROPE, AFRICA; 
STUDY FINDS BETTER AIRPORT SECURITY 
A U.S. commission on aviation security and terrorism appointed after the Flight 
103 disaster said that airport security has improved in Europe. But, "if there 
is an Achilles' heel in aviation security, it is Africa, which is literally a 
basket case," said Rep. James L. Oberstar (D-Minn.), chairman of the House 
Public Works and Transportation subcommittee on aviation. 
Oberstar, at a London news conference, cited poor training for security 
personnel, high staff turnover, insufficient detection equipment and economic 
pressures on African governments for shortcomings there. President Bush 
appointed the seven-member commission after Pan AM Flight 103 from Frankfurt to 
New York via London was blown up by a terrorist bomb over the Scottish town of 
Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988.
