<H5>  A. Structural Strengthening of the R&amp;D System </H5>
<H5>  1. Radical Expansion of MITI R&amp;D Budget </H5>
  (1) The Need for Expansion 
  In April 1992 the Cabinet decided on a new "S&amp;T Policy 
Outline," an important measure in which is the early doubling of 
government S&amp;T investments for the objectives of humankind's 
harmonious coexistence with the earth, expansion of intellectual 
stock, and building a caring society that lives with peace of 
mind. Then in June 1992 the Cabinet decided on the "New Economic 
Plan," which calls for the government to make S&amp;T promotion 
measures one of the pillars of policy administration. Those 
measures include accelerating public fundamental R&amp;D, 
centering 
on basic R&amp;D; an early doubling of government S&amp;T 
investments; 
and helping to make private-sector R&amp;D investments replete. 
  (2) Summary of FY93 Budget 
  For the FY93 R&amp;D budget (including special accounts), 
&yen;282.0 billion are appropriated in all, which is an increase 
of &yen;22.8 billion or 8.8&percnt; over the previous year. The 
S&amp;T 
promotion budget, which centers around general account research 
expenditures, is &yen;58.9 billion for FY93. That is an increase 
of 4.8&percnt; over the previous year, which is significantly 
higher 
than the largest increase during the past 10 years (3.1&percnt; 
in 
FY81). 
<H5>  2. Formulating Guidelines on Industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D, etc. </H5>
  (1) Formulation of Guidelines on Industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D 
  It was pointed out that R&amp;D should be promoted along the 
lines of the report of the Industrial Technology Council's 
planning committee (June 1992). The report lays down guidelines 
on industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D, then comprehensively and 
concretely 
presents the directions in which MITI-driven R&amp;D should 
proceed. 
  For that reason the "R&amp;D Guidelines Committee" (chaired 
by 
Hiroshi Inose, head of the National Center for Science 
Information Systems (NACSIS)) was set up in the general meeting 
of the Industrial Technology Council, and in January 1993 
tentative guidelines on industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D were drafted. 
  Those guidelines set forth a basic policy, under the concept 
of technoglobalism, to promote S&amp;T in three directions: 
basic, 
creative R&amp;D; R&amp;D based on a global, international 
viewpoint; 
and R&amp;D aimed at improving the Japanese people's lifestyle. 
  While MITI will endeavor in R&amp;D based on that draft of 
the 
guidelines, it will broadly seek out viewpoints from all 
perspectives and will work to quickly gain a definite plan. 
  (Components of the tentative guidelines) 
  a) Objectives of the guidelines 
  b) Perception of current state of affairs surrounding 
industrial S&amp;T 
  c) Basic policies on future industrial S&amp;T R&amp;D 
  d) How MITI's R&amp;D should proceed 
  e) R&amp;D directions and topics, by field

  (2) History and Creative Application of Industrial 
Technology 
  &yen;36 million 
  The history of Japan's industrial technology is not only 
significant in that it makes up an important area in history. It 
also tells of the dreams, passions, and efforts that pioneers 
have challenged, and it fosters an environment in which young 
people want to take up the fruitful challenge of creating 
something. 
  Nevertheless, the relics, materials, and living witnesses of 
the history of industrial technology are rapidly disappearing, 
and if activities relating to the history of industrial 
technology are left as they are now, i.e., localized and 
sporadic, it will be very difficult to pass on the history of 
industrial technology to the next generation. 
  Therefore, there is a need for expeditious maintenance of a 
system for passing on the history of industrial technology and 
applying it in the promotion of creative and effective R&amp;D 
and 
the cultivation of excellent researchers. During FY93 MITI will 
promote surveys of materials pertaining to the history of 
industrial technology. 
<H3>  3. Formulation of a Five-Year Plan for Maintenance of MITI 
Research Facilities </H3>
  (1) Already 14 years have passed since the 1979 transfer of 
the Tsukuba research institutes, and the research facilities and 
equipment that were the newest at that time are now 
deteriorating and becoming obsolete. In addition, many of the 
regional test research institutes were built before 1975 and are 
showing marked deterioration. 
  The maintenance of these facilities and equipment forms the 
foundation for R&amp;D activities; and, the level of research in 
the 
future, systems of international cooperation, etc., are 
important issues relating to the roots of research. Therefore, 
facilities maintenance plans must be formulated from a mid-range 
viewpoint, and MITI's test research institutes must be 
systematically equipped and maintained. 
  (2) From that sort of perspective, studies on how mid-range 
maintenance, e.g., 
  a) better facilities and equipment that correlate with 
the state of progress in R&amp;D, 
  b) renovating facilities and equipment based on their 
actual state of deterioration, 
  c) maintaining facilities for promoting and aiding 
international research exchange, and 
  d) maintaining the facilities of regional test research 
institutes, 
  are being made by the Facilities Maintenance Studies 
Committee (chaired by Hisao Oka, director of NEDO) that was 
newly established in the general meeting of the Industrial 
Technology Council. 
  (3) Incidentally, regarding the entire government's research 
facilities maintenance, the government's "Five-Year Plan for 
Maintenance of Research Facilities" is now being drawn up by 
concerned ministries and agencies. 
<H5>  B. Expanding Basic, Creative Research, etc. </H5>
<H3>  1. Establishment of the Industrial S&amp;T Frontier Program 
(ISTF) </H3>
  &yen;25.267 (23.563) billion 
  To promote R&amp;D in basic and innovative areas that will 
contribute to the progress of future societies, the current 
National R&amp;D Programs (large-scale, system-oriented projects) 
and the R&amp;D Program of Basic Technologies for Future 
Industries 
(element- and materials-oriented next-generation projects) are 
not enough. In addition, dealing with the international 
situation that is accompanied by a shift into basic research is 
also difficult with those programs. Another important issue is 
the development of technology to realize a more comfortable way 
of life and to cope with more sophisticated lifestyles. 
  For that reason MITI will integrate the current large-scale 
projects, next-generation projects, etc., and will largely 
distinguish the R&amp;D efforts as follows. 
  (1) Basic and innovative R&amp;D in a serial stream, ranging 
from uncovering seeds to fomenting projects and evaluation, that 
deals with international demands and is aimed at the 
construction of new technology systems and the realization of 
dramatic breakthroughs in technology. 
  (2) R&amp;D for the well-being of communities and societies 
that embraces issues that need to be dealt with from the 
viewpoint of the well-being of communities and societies, e.g., 
resource problems with which the private sector cannot cope 
subjectively and positively, and problems in the differences 
between the north and south. 
  MITI will also conduct leading research that will involve 
preparatory, basic research before the projects begin so that it 
can promote the projects in an efficient, systematic manner. 
  (Budget) 
  -- Leading research 
  &yen;246 (0) million 
  The FY93 research themes are: 
  1) High-order structurally controlled fused inorganic 
materials 
  2) Autonomous response materials 
  3) Technology for utilizing the functions of tropical 
organisms 
  4) Femto-second technology 
  5) Eco factories 
<H3>  2. Comprehensive Energy/Environmental Technology Development 
Promotion Projects (New Sunshine Project) </H3>
  &yen;53.901 (50.255) billion 
  Sustaining continued growth while overcoming environmental 
and energy constraints is an urgent issue for the world. To 
achieve that technological breakthroughs are essential, and the 
development of energy/environmental technology must be promoted 
comprehensively and in an accelerated manner. 
  From such a viewpoint, MITI consolidated the AIST R&amp;D 
programs for new energy technology (Sunshine Project), 
energy-conservation technology (Moonlight Project), and global 
environmental technology, and formulated the New Sunshine 
Project (energy/environmental technology development promotion 
projects) to promote the development of revolutionary 
energy/environmental technology. 
  In the New Sunshine Project, MITI will 1) gradiently 
accelerate and promote internationally open projects involving 
the development of revolutionary energy/environmental 
technology, the aim of which is the realization of the "Action 
Plan for Prevention of Global Warming"; actively promote 2) 
large-scale international joint research programs, the aim of 
which is to promote the "Global Renewal Plan"; and 3) joint 
research programs on appropriate technologies, the aim of which 
is to help alleviate the energy/environmental constraints in 
nearby developing countries. 
  Concretely, under this project MITI will begin new joint 
international technology development efforts to develop a 
"wide-area energy-use network system" (eco-energy city) for the 
first project cited above, a "hydrogen-use international clean 
energy system" (WENET) and exhaust-gas denitration catalysis 
technology for low-fuel-consumption combustion engines for the 
second project above, and a solar-energy-use system for the 
third project above.

<H3>  3. Promotion of R&amp;D of Medical Equipment and Equipment 
for 
the Elderly and Disabled </H3>
  In cooperation with concerned ministries and agencies, MITI 
will establish the "Law to Facilitate R&amp;D and the 
Distribution 
of Implements for the Elderly and Disabled" (tentative name), 
the purpose of which is to radically accelerate the R&amp;D of 
high-tech equipment for the elderly and disabled and facilitate 
the spread of factories that produce such equipment. Along with 
devising the necessary support measures, MITI will a) conduct 
research studies and build a database to give concrete 
expression to the technology, b) conduct research on the basic 
technologies, c) carry out project R&amp;D, and d) aid in the 
development of practical-use equipment for the elderly and 
disabled. In addition, MITI will continue to promote projects 
involving medical equipment R&amp;D.

to accelerate the spread of factories that produce such 
equipment, MITI in cooperation with concerned ministries and 
agencies will look into establishing the "Law to Facilitate 
R&amp;D 
and Distribution of Implements for the Elderly and Disabled" 
(tentative name). Then MITI will proceed with systematic R&amp;D 
that ranges from research studies on concrete realization of the 
technology to assistance in developing practical-use technology. 
  (3) Promotion of the Mellow Society Concept 
  &yen;230 (204) million 
  MITI will strive to expand the mellow society concept, which 
supports elderly people's active participation in society 
through the use of information systems. Concretely, this effort 
involves the development of interfaces that elderly people will 
find easy to use, the construction of a system to centrally 
manage year-to-year health and medical information on 
individuals, and the establishment of a model mellow society. 
  (4) Promotion of Safety Base Maintenance 
  &yen;10 (0) million 
  In order to contribute to better consumer protection, e.g., 
the prevention of accidents involving commercial product and 
quick aid in fixing damages, starting in FY93 the International 
Trade and Industry Inspection Institute will be central in 
promoting the development of technology for investigating the 
causes of product accidents. The technology that is needed for 
elucidating the cause-and-effect relationship in those accidents 
will be based on information about the occurrences of accidents 
in recent years, analyses of causes, etc. 
<H5>  3. Promotion of Information-Related Technology Development </H5>
  (1) Promotion of New Information Processing Technology 
Development (Fourth-Generation Computers) 
  &yen;3,605 (884) million

microgravity environments in space (Free Flyer and 
independent-return-type recovery capsules); and, for 
international global observation programs, the development of a 
futuristic resource-probing sensor (ASTER) that will be mounted 
on U.S. (NASA) satellites. 
<H5>  3. Facilitating Technology Transfer </H5>
  (1) Expanding International Energy/Environmental Cooperation 
(Green Aid Plan) 
  &yen;12.894 (2.671) billion 
  Under the Green Aid Plan, MITI will make the best possible 
use of Japan's advanced technology and experience to solve 
global-scale energy and environmental problems and promote 
cooperation in training, research, surveys, energy conservation 
and new energies, desulfurization technology demonstration 
surveys, etc., for the purpose of transferring and spreading 
energy and environmental technology to developing countries. 
  (2) Research Cooperation Efforts 
  &yen;2.800 (2.613) billion 
  (In which &yen;779 (463) million are for 
energy/environmental 
research cooperation) 
  In the developing countries of Asia where the growth of 
industrialization is astounding, energy and environmental 
problems are becoming serious. In connection with those and 
other technology development issues that are difficult to solve 
given the R&amp;D capabilities of developing countries, MITI will 
effectivate technology cooperation aimed at the transfer of 
existing technologies as well as joint R&amp;D between Japanese 
research organizations and the research organizations of 
developing countries. 
  That research cooperation will not only help to solve the 
individual technology development problems of the developing 
countries. Joint research with Japan's research organizations 
will also help to improve R&amp;D capabilities, which are 
essential 
for the independent development of developing countries.
