FT  12 AUG 93 / Angolan rebels 'pushed back'
THE Angolan government said yesterday it had repelled Unita rebels from
central parts of the city of Cuito, where hundreds of people have been
killed in recent heavy fighting, Reuter reports from Sao Tome.
State radio, monitored in the island state of Sao Tome and Principe, said it
had pushed the rebels back to the outskirts, from where they continued to
shell the central highlands city.
The radio denied reports that Unita had gained the advantage in Cuito. Unita
had controlled some streets but the situation had now been reversed, it
added.
Unita said on Tuesday it had seized part of Cuito, where the government says
rebel shelling has killed more than 200 civilians in the past few days.
Hospital sources quoted by Angolan state radio said more than 20 civilians
were killed in the rebel shelling of the city on Tuesday.
