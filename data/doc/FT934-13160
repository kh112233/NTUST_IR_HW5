FT  22 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin price manipulation alleged
SUGGESTIONS THAT the tin price was being manipulated upwards emerged
yesterday after the metal's price moved decisively through Dollars 5,000 a
tonne on the London Metal Exchange only one month after dropping to a
20-year low point of Dollars 4,360.
Metal for delivery in three months closed yesterday at Dollars 5,053, nearly
16 per cent above last month's low.
'Most of the recent price increase is artificial, the result of a
well-timed, concerted effort to boost the price,' said Ms Lesley Campbell,
analyst at Rudolf Wolff, the commodity broker. As the operation was centred
on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market, rather than the LME, it was probable that
the manipulation was producer  - and not just merchant  - inspired, she
suggested in a special report.
Ms Campbell said the timing of the manipulation was perfect as the market
was oversold and nervous. But also the fundamental situation of the tin
market had changed in the past six weeks as mines had cut production of
concentrate (an intermediate product). The market had not responded to this
trend previously because refined metal is available from other sources such
as the US official stockpile and LME stocks, currently standing at 20,500
tonnes. 'The concentrate tightness could take another year to filter through
and give real support to prices,' said Ms Campbell.
Meanwhile, Reuter reported that delegates at a meeting of the Association of
Tin Producing Countries feared tin stocks could rise from 33,000 to 38,000
tonnes by the end of 1993 against an ATPC target of 20,000 tonnes.
