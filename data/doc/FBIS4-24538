  [Text] Guiyang, May 29 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Guizhou Province, nicknamed the "park province" for its rich 
natural resources and its attractive folk arts and custom, 
received more than 100,000 overseas tourists and 16 million 
domestic visitors last year. 
  The province has eight national scenic spots and four nature 
reserves. It also has many ethnic groups with unique custom and 
traditions. 
  To improve the tourism environment high-quality highways 
have 
been built to link all the main scenic spots, and more than 20 
air routes have been opened from the provincial capital to other 
parts of China. More than 60 travel service companies have been 
established and 17 hotels accredited to accommodate foreign 
tourists have been built in the province. 
  The boom in tourism has brought not only a great amount of 
revenue to the province but has also made changes in many other 
local aspects, according to Yang Shengming, director of the 
provincial tourism administration. 
  Partly as a spinoff of tourism, the province has attracted 
more than 90 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment, which 
has funded more than 820 joint ventures. 
  Meanwhile, local people have begun to learn to speak 
standard 
Chinese and foreign languages, and to do business. Economic and 
cultural exchanges with foreign countries have increased. 
  The provincial government has invited some tourism experts 
to 
help draw up an overall tourism development program for the 
province, according to a local official.
