  [Excerpt] In the Latvian sea resort of Jurmala on Tuesday, 
the Lithuanian and Latvian prime ministers, Adolfas Slezevicius 
and Valdis Birkavs, discussed border delimitation issues. 
Pollution of the sea border with Latvia is a very sensitive 
point, which is related to the construction of an oil terminal 
on the Baltic Sea coast. The two prime ministers also dealt 
with issues of the export and import of farming produce, 
population, and environmental protection, as well as between the 
parliaments and governments of the two states. 
  Unofficial sources say that if Latvia's position on the sea 
border is not acceptable to Lithuania, Prime Minister Adolfas 
Slezevicius is not going to sign any agreement on that issue. 
  Also on Tuesday, the negotiating delegations of Lithuania 
and 
Russia opened a new round of talks. Two expert groups 
coordinated their positions on the issue of border checkpoints 
between Lithuania and the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. Three 
transit points are planned to be opened; one of these in Nida in 
[words indistinct], a narrow strip of land jutting out into the 
Baltic Sea north of the Kaliningrad Region, and as far as the 
Lithuanian sea port of Klaipeda. Another two border crossing 
points of [words indistinct] will be used only by citizens of 
Lithuania and Russia. [passage omitted]
