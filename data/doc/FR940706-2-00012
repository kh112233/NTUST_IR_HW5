SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 27, 1994, notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (59 FR 27535) that a modification of Permit No. 918, issued May 20, 1994 (59 FR 27535), had been requested by the above-named
organization. The requested modification has been granted under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act
of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1361 

et

 

seq

.), the provisions of 216.33(d) and (e) of the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine
Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et

 

seq

.), and the provisions of 222.25 of the regulations governing the taking, importing, and exporting of endangered
fish and wildlife (50 CFR part 222).


Permit No. 918 authorized inadvertent harassment of harbor seals, and the incidental harassment of California sea
lions, Northern elephant seals (

Mirounga

 

angustirostris

), Northern fur seals (

Callorhinus

 

ursinus

) during harbor seal surveys. The modification authorizes inadvertent harassment of harbor seals during scat collections
and Steller sea lions (

Eumetopias

 

jubatus

) and Guadalupe fur seals (

Arctocephalus

 

townsendi

) during aerial surveys to collect data on abundance and distribution of these species along the California coast
and the Channel Islands.
Issuance of this modification, as required by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, was based on a finding that such permit:
(1) Was applied for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the endangered species which is the subject
of this permit; and (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the Endangered Species
Act.
