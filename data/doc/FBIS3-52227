  [Excerpts] Amman--PETRA, Agencies--The Jordanian and 
Palestinian sides led by His Majesty King Husayn and Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat held talks in the royal quarters at 
Queen Alia International Airport upon 'Arafat's arrival 
yesterday afternoon. [passage omitted] 
  An authoritative Jordanian source said that the talks 
covered 
the latest developments in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations 
on the implementation of Palestinian autonomy and obstacles 
preventing it. 
  During the meeting, 'Arafat affirmed the PLO's rejection of 
the Israeli proposals, affirming that the text which was 
published in occupied Jerusalem is an Israeli document which the 
PLO has rejected, the source added. 
  The source also noted that the talks dealt with the 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations and promoting joint coordination. 
  A Palestinian source said that the two sides decided to 
activate their six joint committees and to hold a meeting by the 
higher committee in Amman next week under Prime Minister 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali and PLO Executive Committee member 
Mahmud 'Abbas.
