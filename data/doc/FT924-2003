FT  15 DEC 92 / International Company News: Toshiba in technology deal with
US group
TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics company, and National Semiconductor, of
the US, yesterday announced an alliance aimed at developing a market for
Toshiba's proprietary technology for flash memory devices, semiconductors
which retain information when the power is switched off, much like hard disk
drives.
Flash memory is one of the hottest products in the electronics industry and
is expected eventually to replace disk drives and other magnetic recording
devices in a wide range of portable electronic equipment.
Sales have been dominated by a technology developed by Intel of the US,
which dominates the world's microprocessor market.
Although Toshiba is credited with inventing flash memory, its design of
flash memory has proved more difficult to develop into useable products.
The company earlier this year formed an alliance with IBM, in which Toshiba
would share its flash memory technology, while IBM would share technology
for a controller device allowing high-speed read and write functions.
Toshiba and National Semiconductor said yesterday the Toshiba technology was
most suitable to replace hard and floppy disk drives in computers and
workstations.
Under the terms of the deal, Toshiba will licence its technology to National
Semiconductor and will have rights to derivative technology developed by
National Semiconductor.
Toshiba said a principal motivation for the deal was to encourage
development of the market for its technology by developing a second source
of supply for would-be users.
The agreement follows a common pattern of deals between US and Japanese
semiconductor makers, who have sought shelter from the risks of the
semiconductor business by working together.
