BBC SHOW SAYS STEROID EFFECT MAY BE MENTAL 
Anabolic steroids may have a greater effect on the minds than the bodies of 
athletes trying to improve their performances, a British television documentary 
says. 
"QED: The Steroid Myth" presents evidence from the United States, Britain and 
Italy challenging the view that the physical effects alone of steroids can turn 
good athletes into world champions. 
"The idea that steroids enhance performance may be another damaging myth," the 
program, scheduled for airing Wednesday, concludes. 
At a press briefing today, the program's producer, Chris Thau, said the 
muscle-building powers attributed to steroids can help certain athletes at 
certain times.
