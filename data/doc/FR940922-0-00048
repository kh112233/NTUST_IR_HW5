SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
On December 21, 1990, RSPA issued a final rule under Docket HM181 (55 FR 52402) that comprehensively revised
the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR Parts 171180) with respect to classification, hazard communication,
and packaging requirements of hazardous materials. In Docket HM181, RSPA adopted standards based on United
Nations (UN) recommendations, including replacing the term ``etiologic agent'' with the term ``infectious substance''
and expanding the definition to include additional agents having the potential to cause severe, disabling, or fatal
disease. On January 3, 1991, RSPA issued a final rule under Docket HM142A (56 FR 197), removing the previous
exception from regulation for cultures and stocks of etiologic agents (infectious substances) of 50 milliliters
or less total quantity in one outside package (the ``50 milliliter exception''). 


On December 20, 1991, in response to a large number of petitions for reconsideration, RSPA published a final rule making
editorial and substantive revisions to the December 1990 final rule (56 FR 66124). In response to one petition for
reconsideration, RSPA identified a subcategory of Division 6.2 (infectious substances) materials described as
``regulated medical waste'' (RMW), and provided packaging requirements for RMW which were less rigorous than those
for other infectious substances. Following issuance of the December 1991 rule, RSPA received additional petitions
for reconsideration and numerous comments and requests for clarification concerning provisions applicable to
infectious substances and RMW. Petitioners were concerned that RSPA had not adequately considered the costs and
other ramifications of adopting requirements for RMW. Commenters were concerned over potential overlaps or inconsistencies
with other Federal agencies that regulate infectious substances. In partial response to the petitions, RSPA extended
the compliance date for infectious substances from October 1, 1992, to April 1, 1993 (October 1, 1992; 57 FR 45442).
This extension and others which followed (March 3, 1993; 58 FR 12182 and December 20, 1993; 58 FR 66302) also applied
to the 50 milliliter exception which was removed under Docket HM142A.

On March 3, 1993, RSPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) and announced a public hearing under
Docket HM181G (58 FR 12207) concerning the need for additional regulatory changes pertaining to infectious
substances. In order to provide time to evaluate the oral and written comments received in response to the ANPRM, RSPA
also extended the compliance date (58 FR 12182) for provisions applicable to infectious substances from April 1,
1993, to January 1, 1994. The ANPRM addressed a number of complex issues, pertaining to scope of regulation, consistency
with regulations of other agencies, the need for revised standards for non-bulk and bulk packagings, and defining
criteria for infectious substances and RMW. Following issuance of the ANPRM, RSPA continued its efforts to gain information
on other Federal agencies' regulatory requirements, and hosted and participated in a number of interagency meetings
on this issue. Federal agencies that regulate infectious substances include the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration of the Department of Labor, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration
of the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Postal Service and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service of the Department of Agriculture. On December 20, 1993 (58 FR 66302), RSPA again extended the compliance date
for provisions applicable to infectious substances from January 1, 1994, to October 1, 1994, to provide additional
time for resolving the issues of concern. 
RSPA intends to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the near future. The NPRM will address those issues
concerning infectious substances and RMW that must be addressed in the near term to ensure the safe transportation
of these materials. The NPRM also will outline RSPA's intent to make a longer-term effort to harmonize requirements
of the HMR with international regulations and with the regulations of the other Federal agencies, and identify and
address gaps in regulation that may adversely impact transportation safety. 
Based on the merits of comments and petitions, RSPA believes there may be undue adverse impacts if regulatory provisions
for infectious substances go into effect on October 1, 1994 without change. Therefore, in this document, RSPA is revising
49 CFR 171.14(b) to extend the compliance dates. For regulatory requirements for RMW and for materials infectious
to animals only, the compliance date is extended from October 1, 1994, to October 1, 1995. This time period should be
adequate for RSPA to publish the NPRM, evaluate comments received in response to the NPRM, and make any necessary changes
to the HMR based on the merits of those comments. Without an extension of this compliance date, shippers and transporters
of these materials would have to comply with regulations that are likely to be changed in the near future and, thereby,
incur unnecessary costs. 
For other infectious substances, i.e., for cultures and stocks of substances infectious to humans, the compliance
date is extended from October 1, 1994, to January 1, 1995. The requirements for these materials generally were not
at issue in comments or petitions to the December 1991 final rule. The principal impacts of the January 1, 1995 compliance
date will be a nomenclature change from the old ``etiologic agent'' hazard class to the new ``Division 6.2'' classification,
elimination of the 50 milliliter exception for cultures and stocks, and expansion of the definition of infectious
substances to cover substances, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Lyme disease, which are not listed
in the CDC regulations (42 CFR 72.3). The removal of the 50 milliliter exception and expansion of the definition of
infectious substances originally were to have occurred on February 19, 1991 (Docket HM142A; January 3, 1991;
56 FR 197). RSPA believes it is necessary to implement these requirements as quickly as possible to ensure public safety
and end confusion as to the status of materials that were not regulated prior to 1990. 
During the transition periods provided in 171.14, a person may comply with either the applicable ``old'' requirements
of the HMR (i.e., those which were in effect on September 30, 1991), or the current requirements adopted under HM181.
If a material is an etiologic agent under the old regulations and does not meet any of the old exceptions, it must conform
to either the old requirements (i.e., must be described, labeled and packaged as an ``etiologic agent'') or the current
requirements of the HMR for ``infectious substances.'' (Note that Section 171.14(c)(3) provides for limited intermixing
of old and new requirements).
