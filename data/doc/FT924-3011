FT  10 DEC 92 / Neo-Nazi jailed for racist acts
A COURT yesterday sentenced a leading German neo-Nazi to two years and eight
months in jail as part of a crackdown on extreme-right violence against
foreigners and Jews, Reuter reports from Rudolstadt, Germany. Thomas Dienel,
the boss of the far-right DNP party, was found guilty by a court in the
eastern town of Rudolstadt of inciting racist violence by calling for the
mass murder of Jews and asylum seekers.
Separately, the German government announced that Dienel and another leading
neo-Nazi would be stripped of their constitutional rights.
