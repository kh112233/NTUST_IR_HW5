LOCAL; 
4 SUSPECTS INJURED IN CRASH 
Four suspected car thieves -- who crashed one stolen vehicle and then attempted 
to escape in another -- were seriously injured today when the second vehicle 
collided head-on with a semi-trailer truck, Los Angeles police said. 
The first stolen car was carrying six people when it overturned shortly before 
3:30 a.m. in front of a home on Devonshire Street near Woodman Avenue in 
Mission Hills. 
Police were investigating the possibility that the car ended up on the lawn as 
a result of a hit-and-run collision. 
Neighborhood residents wakened by the crash saw the car's six occupants climb 
out and attempt to run away. The residents chased and caught two of the 
suspects, Officer Clarence Dean said. 
The remaining four ran to the intersection of Sepulveda Boulevard and 
Devonshire Street, where they commandeered a Toyota pickup truck and robbed its 
driver, police said. 
The four, two in front and two riding in the bed, drove west to Chatsworth. 
Police said the pickup was traveling at a high speed in the 20500 block of 
Nordhoff Street when it crashed head-on into an eastbound 18-wheel truck. 
The front passengers suffered broken legs and internal injuries and the two 
riding in the back also were seriously injured, police said. The driver of the 
semi-trailer truck was not hurt. 
The injured, who were not immediately identified, were taken to Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center and West Park Hospital.
