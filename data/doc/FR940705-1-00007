Nutrition Labeling of Ground Beef and Hamburger 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Extension of comment period. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On May 24, 1994, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) published a proposed rule (59 FR 26916) to amend the Federal
meat inspection regulations by permitting percentage labeling for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger, provided
such product labeling contains nutrition information. FSIS has received a request to extend the comment period on
the proposed rule so that additional data and information can be provided. FSIS has determined that the request should
be granted and, therefore, is extending the comment period on the proposed rule for 45 days. FSIS is continuing to evaluate
the effect that this extension will have on issues such as the survey for significant participation for voluntary
nutrition labeling and the approval of labeling for ground beef and hamburger pending the outcome of this rulemaking.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On May 24, 1994, FSIS published in the 

Federal Register

 a proposed rule (59 FR 26916) to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations by permitting percentage labeling
for lean and fat on ground beef and hamburger, provided such product labeling contains nutrition information. The
proposed rule would provide increased flexibility in the labeling of ground beef and hamburger, and would also allow
consumers to readily identify and differentiate between the varying lean/fat percentages of these products. 



Interested persons were given until July 8, 1994, in which to comment on the proposed rule. FSIS has received a request
from a consumer interest group to extend the comment period on the proposed rule to allow additional time for consumer
survey data to be gathered and submitted. FSIS noted in its proposed rule on percentage labeling for lean/fat on ground
beef and hamburger (59 FR 26916) that it had not assessed whether multiple uses of the term ``percent lean'' might result
in consumer misunderstanding that would limit informed consumer choice. The consumer survey will provide information
on consumer perceptions of the terms ``lean,'' ``extra lean,'' ``percent lean,'' ``reduced fat,'' and ``percent
daily value.'' FSIS is interested in receiving such data to assist in its efforts to develop comprehensive nutrition
labeling regulations that will help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. FSIS believes that it would be
a disservice to consumers and industry for FSIS to deny an opportunity for further input into a decision on the labeling
of ground beef and hamburger. Therefore, FSIS is extending the comment period on the proposed rule for 45 days so that
any labeling decision resulting from its proposed rule reflects the greatest amount of data and information available
on this important issue. FSIS is continuing to evaluate the effect that this extension will have on issues such as the
survey for significant participation for voluntary nutrition labeling and the approval of labeling for ground beef
and hamburger pending the outcome of this rulemaking.
