Sulfiting Agents; Withdrawal of Regulation Revoking Gras Status for Use on ``Fresh'' Potatoes Served or Sold Unpackaged
and Unlabeled to Consumers 



<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Food and Drug Administration, HHS. 



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing a final rule that revoked the generally recognized as safe (GRAS)
listing of sulfiting agents (i.e., sulfur dioxide, sodium sulfite, sodium and potassium bisulfite, and sodium and
potassium metabisulfite) on ``fresh'' potatoes that are intended to be served or sold unpackaged and unlabeled to
the consumer. The agency is revising its regulations in accordance with the withdrawal. This action is being taken
in response to a court ruling.

 

</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 December 22, 1994. Insofar as it prohibits the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes that are intended to be
served or sold unpackaged and unlabeled to consumers, the final rule being withdrawn has been null and void since a
court ruling to that effect on August 3, 1990.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 15, 1990 (55 FR 9826), FDA published a final rule that amended the GRAS regulations to revoke GRAS status for
the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes. The rule was challenged by the ``fresh'' potato industry and invalidated
by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on procedural grounds; subsequently, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, i.e., the full court, heard the case and, by an equally divided
vote, let the district court's decision stand. In accordance with the court's ruling, the agency is withdrawing the
revocation of GRAS status for the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes and is revising 
182.3616, 182.3637, 182.3739, 182.3766, 182.3798, and 182.3862 (21 U.S.C. 182.3616, 182.3637, 182.3639,
182.3766, 182.3798, and 182.3862) accordingly. 




Because the issuance of this document is in response to a court order, FDA finds that providing notice and public comment
prior to the publication of this final rule is unnecessary and may therefore be dispensed with for good cause under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Therefore, publication of this rule withdrawing the revocation of GRAS status for use of sulfiting
agents on ``fresh'' potatoes constitutes final action. The agency advises, however, that it has continuing concerns
about the safety of this use of sulfiting agents and is considering further action.
