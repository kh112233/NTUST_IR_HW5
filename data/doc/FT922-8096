FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: Audi looks for transatlantic
base
AUDI, the up-market subsidiary of Volkswagen, is looking at the possibility
of building a car plant in North America, where its sales are recovering
after several difficult years.
Mr Ferdinand Piech, Audi chief executive who takes over as head of VW next
year, said yesterday Audi was evaluating sites in Mexico, the US or Canada
to produce cars from the mid-1990s. VW already has a plant in Mexico which
it has modernised to serve the US market.
Audi's efforts to set up a transatlantic base are in line with Mercedes-Benz
and BMW, its main German rival. Mercedes, owned by the Daimler-Benz group,
will begin small-scale assembly of car kits in Mexico next year. BMW is also
looking at likely US production sites, with a decision expected soon.
Audi, whose net profits jumped 30 per cent last year to DM370m (Dollars
224m) on a turnover rise of 22 per cent to DM14.8bn, has suffered in the US
from allegations that its cars accelerated without warning.
But with new models priced competitively in the US at levels near those of
Japanese cars, Audi's sales in the US rose 41 per cent to 5,100 cars in the
first four months of 1992.
The company said profits should show a further increase this year, with
turnover expected to reach DM16.2bn.
