FT  18 FEB 93 / Laureates fight for Burma dissident
A CAMPAIGN launched yesterday for the release of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the
detained Burmese opposition leader, has rekindled a fierce debate in Asia
about human rights and the merits of Asian countries intervening in their
neighbours' affairs.
Eight Nobel Peace Prize winners, after being refused entry to Burma, came to
neighbouring Thailand to start the campaign for their fellow laureate. Ms
Suu Kyi won the prize in 1991 and has been held under house arrest for over
three years by Rangoon's military junta.
The campaign has won support from the Clinton administration and
prizewinners unable to come to Thailand, such as Mother Teresa and Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev, former Soviet president. But China issued two warnings to
Thailand in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the Dalai Lama, the exiled
Tibetan spiritual leader, from taking part. China invaded Tibet in 1950.
The campaign to release Ms Suu Kyi marks a break from the traditional
South-East Asian policy of 'constructive engagement' with Burma. Thailand's
armed forces, enjoying lucrative logging concessions there, have criticised
the Thai government for hosting a visit they fear will damage Bangkok's
relations with both Beijing and Rangoon.
Gen Vimol Wongwanich, army commander, said such campaigns should be held in
the US, not Thailand. 'It's like inviting the battle into our house,' he
said. The Thai army banned the screening of an interview with the Dalai Lama
on one of the TV stations it controls.
Previous Thai governments have bowed to Chinese pressure over the Dalai
Lama, refusing him a visa in 1987 and 1990. But Mr Chuan Leekpai, the
civilian prime minister elected on a liberal ticket last year, has allowed
all the Nobel laureates into the country. Both he and King Bhumipol are
scheduled to meet them.
In Bangkok yesterday, the Dalai Lama avoided overt criticism of China or
Thailand, but implicitly chided them for supplying weapons and aid to the
Burmese junta and suggested an arms embargo would be a good idea.
'In Thailand and everywhere, the value of human rights and of democracy is
increasing,' he declared. 'In a new era, everyone is concerned about
democracy, human rights and freedom.'
The visiting laureates, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa,
northern Ireland peace campaigners Ms Betty Williams and Ms Mairead Maguire,
and an Amnesty International representative, are to meet Burmese refugees
today.
At the weekend some of them will go to Geneva to make a submission to the UN
Human Rights Commission.
