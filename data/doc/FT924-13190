FT  16 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Producing the perfect droplet
A new liquid spray technology which enables droplets to be produced in a
uniform size has been invented by Cambridge Consultants (CCL), the UK design
and development group.
Conventional liquid spraying technology produces droplets of varying size
over a wide range, but uniform droplets offer potential benefits to a
variety of users.
In agricultural spraying, for example, a more regular drop size maximises
the amount of insecticide, fungicide or herbicide reaching the plants. The
drops will not be so small that they are blown away or so large that they
fall straight to the ground.
And in vehicle fuel injectors, a more uniform spray offers cleaner and more
predictable combustion, says CCL, while controlled drop size in fire-
fighting could reduce the amount of water needed. Cambridge Consultants: UK,
