FT  18 JUN 92 / Estonia to issue its own currency
ESTONIA will issue its own currency, the kroon, on June 20-22, becoming the
first former Soviet republic to abandon the rouble zone and introduce a
separate national currency.
The kroon is to be tied to the German D-Mark, with a 3 per cent fluctuation
band allowed. But its initial exchange rate against the D-Mark has yet to be
fixed, as has the rate for conversion of cash roubles into kroons.
The kroon is to be the only legal tender in Estonia and all hard currency
accounts will be converted into the new currency. But this could be a
problem if doubts about the kroon's convertibility arise. Estonia, with only
1.5m people, has just Dollars 120m in gold - as well as central bank-owned
stretches of forest - with which to back its currency.
Trade with the rouble zone could be seriously disrupted. An agreement for
clearing payments has been agreed only with Ukraine, but a draft treaty with
Russia, with which Estonia conducts over half its trade and from which it
gets vital fuel supplies, has not yet been signed.
Success or failure of the kroon will determine the course taken by other
former Soviet republics anxious to dump the 'occupation rouble'. Ukraine has
signalled that it will issue its own currency later this summer if the
Estonian move is successful.
Estonia's two Baltic neighbours, Latvia and Lithuania, have already taken
steps towards new currencies.
