SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
I. Background 


On November 8, 1990, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub L. 101535) (the 1990 amendments)
was enacted. This new law amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number of important ways. One
of the most notable aspects of the 1990 amendments is that they added section 403(q) to the act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)). This
section provides that, with certain exceptions, a food_that is, both a food in conventional form and a dietary supplement
of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances_is misbranded unless its label or labeling
bears certain nutrition information (nutrition labeling). 

The 1990 amendments, however, also provide an exemption from mandatory nutrition labeling for small businesses.
Section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act provides that:




[I]f a person offers food for sale and has annual gross sales made or business done in sales to consumers which is not
more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers which is not more than
$50,000, the requirements of subparagraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) [the provisions that establish the nutrition labeling
requirement] shall not apply with respect to food sold by such person to consumers unless the label or labeling of food
offered by such person provides nutrition information or makes a nutrition claim.

 


In the 

Federal Register

 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60376), in a document entitled ``Food Labeling; Reference Daily Intakes and Daily
Reference Values; Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrient Content Revision'' (hereinafter referred
to as ``the mandatory nutrition labeling proposal''), FDA proposed to reflect this provision of the 1990 amendments
in 101.9(j)(1) of its regulations (21 CFR 101.9(j)(1)). 

Many comments to the mandatory nutrition labeling proposal stressed that the dollar exemption limits that FDA proposed
to implement in the 1990 amendments were too low. The comments argued that the sum of the analytical, printing, and
other costs of nutrition labeling are prohibitively expensive for low-volume products. FDA found that these comments
were persuasive, and that some adjustment to this exemption was necessary. Additionally, FDA participated in a series
of public forums that had been scheduled by the United States Department of Agriculture to discuss the small business
issue. These forums were held in May 1992 in Kansas City, MO; Atlanta, GA; and San Francisco, CA. In the 

Federal Register

 of May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19410), FDA announced its participation in the public forums and requested comment on a number
of issues concerning exemption of food products of small businesses. 

The agency compiled the information that it received in response to the notice and at the public forums. This information
helped form the basis for the agency's ``Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis of the Regulations Implementing
the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990'' (Ref. 1). FDA announced the public availability of this analysis
in the 

Federal Register

 of July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36205). 

In adopting the exemption for food labeled by small businesses in its final rule on nutrition labeling of January 6,
1993, entitled ``Food Labeling: Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrient Content Revision, Format for
Nutrition Label'' (58 FR 2079 at 2144) (hereinafter referred to as ``the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule''),
FDA stated that it was constrained by the requirements of section 403(q)(5)(D) of the act. Therefore, the agency adopted
the exemption for small business, as it had proposed the exemption, as part of the mandatory nutrition labeling final
rule in 101.9(j)(1)(i). This exemption (as corrected on August 18, 1993 (58 FR 44063 at 44083)) states:




Food [is exempt from 101.9 

Nutrition labeling of food

 when] offered for sale by a manufacturer, packer, or distributor who has annual gross sales made or business done in
sales to consumers that is not more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers
of not more than $50,000, 

Provided

, That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information in any context on the label or in labeling or
advertising. Claims or other nutrition information subject the food to the provisions of this section.




The agency stated, however, that it would make changes in 101.9 with respect to products labeled by small businesses
if Congress were to amend the statute.
