FT  16 FEB 94 / World Trade News: US seeks to dog Chinese copycats - Tony
Walker on moves to halt copyright infringements
When Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, passes through the ornate portals of
China's leadership compound in Beijing next month, he will have more on his
mind than simply paying respects to senior Chinese officials.
Ostensibly, Mr Gates will be in the Chinese capital to meet Microsoft
executives and local distributors, but he is certain to use the occasion to
complain about the rampant pirating of his company's products in potentially
the world's largest software market.
Industry representatives in Beijing estimate that Chinese software pirates
are costing US manufacturers, notably Microsoft, about Dollars 500m (Pounds
342m) a year in lost revenues.
Software piracy is at the top of the list of intellectual property rights
infringements that are preoccupying US trade officials in their testy
relationship with their Chinese counterparts.
Indeed, it may well become an issue in Washington's annual wrangle with
Beijing over the continuation of China's Most Favoured Nation trading
status. China's attempts to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade may also be affected.
Later this month in Beijing, when officials from the office of the US Trade
Representative conduct their third session since October with Chinese
counterparts on the issue of intellectual property rights, discussions are
likely to have a sharper focus.
This is because the US Trade Representative is obliged by April to recommend
whether to place China on a priority list of foreign countries infringing
copyright covenants, and thus begin the six-months countdown to the
imposition of trade sanctions under section 301 of the US Trade Act.
These semi-regular meetings have not been without their theatrical moments.
To reinforce their point, US officials have gone to the streets of the
capital, bought boxes full of counterfeit items such as CDs and American
brand-name clothing and dumped them on the table in front of their startled
Chinese counterparts.
Among steps being sought by US representatives is more vigorous Chinese
customs co-operation to curtail either the export or import of pirated
goods.
US officials note that US Customs ranks China first on the list of countries
exporting counterfeit items to the US market. Some Dollars 120m worth were
seized in 1992.
Chinese intellectual property rights abuses tend to run the gamut of
transgressions against trademarks, patents and copyright in spite of Beijing
having become a signatory recently to a range of international conventions,
including the Geneva (Phonograms) Convention, the Berne Convention for
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Universal Copyright
Convention.
China and the US also initialled an intellectual property rights memorandum
of understanding in January 1992. This document, with its safeguards
provisions against abuses, is the basis of ongoing official discussions.
Apart from software piracy, the recording industry is the other big loser in
a fast growing China consumer market. According to the International
Federation of the Phonographic Industry, the representative body for
producers of records, cassettes and CDs, 'piracy is becoming rampant . . .
as an entrepreneurial spirit develops alongside economic reforms'.
The IFPI estimates that 15 pirate CD plants are operating in China,
including eight in southern Guangdong province, with a total production
capacity of more than 50m units a year. This compares with estimated
domestic demand for legitimately produced CDs of just 3m units in 1993.
Chinese officials, recognising perhaps that pirating has got out of hand,
have begun to emphasise steps they have been taking to crack down on
intellectual property rights infringements, including the establishment of
special courts to deal with the problem.
People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, reported this week that a
Taiwanese had been successfully prosecuted before a Shanghai court for
illegally manufacturing CDs. The paper accused the man of 'damaging China's
reputation' and said the case had 'brought to light the illegal
proliferation of laser CD production in China'.
Ms Wu Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic co-operation,
insisted at a recent press briefing that the authorities were doing all they
could to counter such abuses, but China was a 'large country' and
enforcement was not easy.
Western lawyers in Beijing say that China appears more sincere in its
efforts to deal with infringements, but a big problem was the huge gap
between the enactment of regulations and their implementation.
'Western companies seeking redress before the courts are only going to have
limited success. It's such a vast problem that it's really difficult to get
enforcement,' said one.
Lawyers tend to advise clients to use 'administrative means', such as
appeals to the authorities, to press their concerns. Recourse to the courts,
which lack sophistication in dealing with anything but the simplest cases,
should be a last resort.
