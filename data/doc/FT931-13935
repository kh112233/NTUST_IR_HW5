FT  21 JAN 93 / Europarks was 'damaged goods'
INDUSTRIAL espionage allegedly ordered by Mr Gordon Layton, the former chief
executive of National Car Parks, could have cost his main business rival
millions of pounds, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Stephen Tucker, former head of Europarks, the car parking company, said
he had 'lost the future' of his business after it became public knowledge
that KAS, a security company, had allegedly spied on Europarks for NCP.
Europarks had become 'damaged goods', Mr Tucker said.
Documents allegedly obtained by KAS for NCP would have been very valuable to
a business rival, he agreed. These included documents about potential future
sites, Europarks' financial position and plans to turn it into a public
company.
His company was left in a very poor position to compete with NCP and
potential purchasers of Europarks were well aware its most sensitive
information was in the hands of NCP, Mr Tucker said.
He sold his company to NCP in 1990 for Pounds 3.3m and accepted Pounds 1m
damages, the court heard. Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bankers, had advised
him the company was worth between Pounds 5m and Pounds 15m, he said.
Mr Layton and Mr Simon Hewitt, a former KAS employee, both deny conspiring
to defraud Europarks by dishonestly acquiring information relating to its
business affairs between January 1987 and November 1989. The trial continues
today.
