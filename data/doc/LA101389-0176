POPE ATTACKS BIRTH CONTROL IN INDONESIA ON LAST DAY OF VISIT 
John Paul II today attacked birth control in Indonesia, a Third World pioneer 
in restricting population growth. 
In a speech on the last day of his five-day visit to predominantly Muslim 
Indonesia, he told Catholic bishops: "You are sometimes painfully aware that 
certain traditional practices and other contemporary social influences bring 
about an obscuring of fundamental principles regarding family life and the 
responsible transmission of life." Vatican officials confirmed that this was a 
reference to birth control as well as polygamy and the subordinate position of 
women. 
Aggressive promotion of birth control has been official policy since 1970 in 
Indonesia, the world's fifth most populous country. President Suharto this year 
received the first U.N. award for population growth control.
