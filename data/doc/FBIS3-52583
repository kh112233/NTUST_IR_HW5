  [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal says the most 
important issue to be discussed at the Taba talks next week will 
be the relationship between the Israeli security forces and the 
Palestinian police. 
  Minister Shahal, addressing the Israeli Association for 
Industrial Security this morning, said the agreement between 
Israel and Jordan is finalized and there is absolutely no 
controversy between the two countries on any issue. Shahal 
expressed the opinion that King Husayn is waiting for the right 
time to announce the signing of a peace treaty with Israel, and 
this could happen after the Clinton-al-Asad meeting. 
  Our correspondent Shim'on Vilna'i adds that Minister Shahal 
denounced the planting of the bombs near the Peace Now offices 
in New York. He said the police will strive to uncover elements 
such as those who have tried to smuggle arms into Israel.
