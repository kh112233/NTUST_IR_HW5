  [Text] On 4 May, the newspaper GRANMA published an 
editorial entitled, South Africa: Triumph Belongs to Those Who 
Struggle, on the ANC victory in the South African elections. 
GRANMA highlights Nelson Mandela's words during his visit to 
Cuba: We are determined to have the people of South Africa forge 
their own future. When that moment comes, it will not have been 
solely through our own efforts, but also thanks to the 
solidarity, support, and encouragement of the extraordinary 
people of Cuba. 
  The editorial goes on to point out that the Cuito Canavale 
victory overturned the balance of power in South Africa, which 
resulted in consolidation, through the ballot, of the efforts 
cemented for years with blood. The GRANMA editorial pays tribute 
to Mandela's wisdom, revolutionary determination, and strength, 
noting that he and his valiant people are today the fulfillment 
of hopes and dreams.
