FT  20 JAN 94 / Customs warns Eurotunnel over its security measures
Customs officials have warned Eurotunnel that attempts to police the Channel
tunnel once it opens will be undermined by the company's rules on obtaining
information on passengers.
According to a senior official, there are concerns that Customs will not
have the information it needs, although passengers will be subject to
standard passport checks.
'From a purely Customs point of view, it's going to mean more drugs getting
through. From a security angle, it could mean that some terrorists will be
travelling and no one will pick them up,' he said.
Customs views the threat as so serious that it has been considering asking
the government to put pressure on Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator, to change
its practices.
However, the company said last night: 'We never intended to give full
passenger details. We are a railway, not a ferry company. It's a
turn-up-and-go system. We think the controls we will have will be
sufficient.'
Customs officials believe that effective policing of Channel crossings is
dependent on being given full information on vehicle registrations,
passengers and freight. The system planned by Eurotunnel will limit the
information it can give to Customs to advance reservations only, which it is
estimated will account for only about 30 per cent of those actually using
the trains on any particular day.
A senior Customs official said: 'If we are not given full information as to
who is travelling, we can't select individuals for target searching based on
intelligence.' Claims that the first year of the Single Market would provide
opportunities for drugs smuggling have been disproved, Sir John Cope,
paymaster-general, said yesterday.
Sir John, the minister responsible for Customs, said: 'After this first year
it is clear that our anti-smuggling controls, together with
intelligence-based strategies, have maintained effectiveness in the fight
against drugs.'
