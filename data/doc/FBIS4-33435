  [Text] Havana, 4 Jun (PL) -- Cuba today announced that, 
despite current economic difficulties, its infant population is 
totally protected by massive vaccination against illnesses 
common in other countries. A Public Health Ministry report 
states that top priority is given to vaccinating children 
against tuberculosis, hepatitis-B, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, 
whooping cough, meningococcus groups B and C, mumps, German 
measles, measles, and typhus. 
  These maladies cause a great number of deaths in 
underdeveloped countries, including Latin American countries, 
but in Cuba, with its prevention policies, a 95 percent rate of 
eradication among the country's children has been guaranteed. 
  The system begins working immediately after the child is 
born, through tuberculosis and hepatitis B vaccinations; and 
when they are four weeks old children receive the polio vaccine, 
which is then reactivated in subsequent booster shots. 
  Cuba produces the only effective meningococcus groups B and 
C 
vaccine in the world, as well as the tetanus toxin and vaccines 
intended to prevent typhoid and hepatitis B. 
  The newspaper GRANMA reported today that a vaccine against 
leptospisarosis, as well as other vaccines designed to prevent 
various illnesses, is currently being clinically tested as part 
of the program that fully protects children and adults.
