FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Genentech drug clears hurdle
GENENTECH, the US biotechnology company, yesterday moved a step closer to
launching its proposed new treatment for cystic fibrosis when the key Food
and Drug Administration committee reviewing the drug unanimously recommended
its approval.
The company earlier in the day received an apparent setback when staff
members of the US Food and Drug Administration said the drug, known as
Pulmozyme or DNase, needed further testing.
The company's shares had fallen Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 42 3/8 by the close
in New York on the staff report, which called into question the long-term
safety and effectiveness of the drug. The report was presented to the FDA's
pulmonary-allergy drugs advisory committee, which issues recommendations on
whether or not the full FDA should approve new drugs in its area.
After the stock market close, however, the advisory committee unanimously
voted to recommend that the drug be approved.
Although the committee's recommendation is not binding, is almost always
accepted by the FDA.
