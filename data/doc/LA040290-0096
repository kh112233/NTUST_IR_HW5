ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
BACK IN THE FRAY: Tom C. Rogers, above, a slow-growth advocate from San Juan 
Capistrano, has started a statewide group to help defeat Proposition 111, the 
governor's June ballot proposal to increase the gas tax for major road 
improvements. . . . Rogers says he is against the initiative because it tampers 
with state spending limitations put in place by Paul Gann's Proposition 4 in 
1979. . . . It's "misleading," he says, because "you have to read it four times 
before you get the notion that it's a gas tax hike." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve
