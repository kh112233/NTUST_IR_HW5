<F P=106> [Report by Luc Van Broeck: ``With MOX in Nuclear Plant, </F>
Radiation for Staff Increases Slightly''] 
  [Text] Doel, 28 Dec -- Following an extremely turbulent 
discussion, the Chamber passed the controversial MOX resolution. 
From now on spent nuclear fuels can be recycled into MOX fuel, 
to be used in nuclear plants. According to Electrabel the 
recycling of plutonium into MOX from spent nuclear fuels is a 
far better solution than the very expensive storage. Electrabel 
points out that MOX is already used on a regular basis in 
similar reactors in Switzerland, Germany, and France, without 
any safety problems. 
  According to Electrabel the use of MOX will hardly change 
anything to Doel's operation and safety. ``Surveys have 
established that the use of MOX in a nuclear plant raises the 
collective radiation dose for the staff by 1 percent at the 
most, which is much less than the normal variations from one 
year to another. For the people living close to the nuclear 
plant nothing changes,'' Electrabel says. 
  The standard fuel elements which are currently used in the 
nuclear plants at Doel and Tihange do not contain any plutonium 
when they are loaded into the reactor, but they do when they are 
removed from the reactor at a rate of roughly 5 kg of plutonium 
per element. So the main difference between a MOX- and a 
standard fuel element is the presence of plutonium. The term 
MOX refers to mixed oxide, made up of uranium and plutonium 
oxide. 
  In pursuance of a contract which was concluded in 1978, a 
small part of Belgium's spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed 
in the French reprocessing plant at La Haque until the year 
2000. Approximately 4,600 kg of plutonium will be recovered from 
these nuclear fuels. From the end of 1993 onwards, this 
quantity must return to Belgium, through annual deliveries. 
  ``We should not forget,'' Electrabel emphasizes, ``that 300 
to 400 tonnes of MOX fuel is enough to ensure the whole Belgian 
power production for three years.''
