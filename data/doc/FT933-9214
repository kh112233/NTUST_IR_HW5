FT  11 AUG 93 / Argentine threat to UK over S Atlantic fishing
ARGENTINA has threatened to retaliate against the UK's introduction of a new
fishing licence regime in the waters around the British-held South Georgia
and South Sandwich islands, which Argentina claims as its own.
Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, said: 'Britain will pay a very high
price for this joke.' He said Argentina would censure the British decision
in multilateral conservation bodies covering the Antarctic.
However, the ministry did not expand on what price Argentina planned to
exact from the UK or how it would do so.
Britain had told Argentina privately that it intended to introduce a fishing
regime in the two islands' territorial waters on August 1, but made no
statement on the issue.
Mr Di Tella only announced the British decision on Monday.
London had already extended to 200 miles, from 12 miles, the islands'
territorial waters prior to imposing the licence regime, similar to one
introduced in the nearby Falkland Islands seven years ago.
UK officials said they have already received considerable signs of interest
from fishing companies to take out the new licences, with fees to be based
on a percentage of the catch.
Debate in Argentina over the future of the Falkland Islands has intensified
in the past 10 days, after it had emerged that the Argentine government was
considering the concession, under its sovereignty, of a special status for
the islands, similar to Puerto Rico's status as an associate of the US.
This would enable the islands to retain all their present rights of
self-determination, the use of sterling as currency, and allegiance to the
British crown, while transferring only formal sovereignty to Argentina.
However, some Argentine analysts feared that changing the nature of
Argentina's claim to the islands was only a prelude to surrendering it
altogether.
