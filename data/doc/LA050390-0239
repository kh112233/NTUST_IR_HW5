BUSH 'CAN'T REJOICE' WHILE 6 OTHERS ARE HELD HOSTAGE 
President Bush said today that while he welcomes the recent release of two 
Americans hostages in Lebanon, he "can't rejoice . . . as long as six others 
are held hostage." 
Asked whether the release of Frank Reed and Robert Polhill might foretell the 
release of all Americans, Bush said, "I can't say that our actions facilitated 
the release of Reed and Polhill. 
"I hope that the affirmation and reaffirmation of our policy contributed, but 
there were no behind-the-scenes actions that pulled this off." 
The President said at a morning news conference that he welcomed the release of 
Reed and Polhill, "but I can't rejoice and say my heart is full of hope and 
goodwill as long as six others are held hostages." 
The six include Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the 
Associated Press, who was kidnaped in March, 1985, and is the longest-held 
Western hostage in Lebanon. 
Bush said he would be willing to make goodwill gestures to Iran "that wouldn't 
be perceived as negotiating for the release of hostages." 
Asked what those gestures might be, the President mentioned that Iran is eager 
to learn about four Iranian diplomats kidnaped in Lebanon in 1982. 
"If we could go back and get any information that would relieve the anxiety of 
the loved ones of those people, we ought to do that," Bush said. "I can 
understand the Iranians wanting the full accounting. Here they've said, 'Here 
is an area where we can get information.' " 
He added that the United States does not think the four diplomats are alive.
