FT  04 APR 92 / Election 92: No deals, says Plaid Cymru
PLAID CYMRU, the Welsh nationalist party, yesterday declared that it would
not enter any political deals with the London-based parties if there were a
hung parliament, Anthony Moreton writes.
'Our priority is that a Welsh parliament should be set up within a year of a
new government taking office,' said Mr Dafydd Wigley, the party's president
and MP for Caernarfon in the last parliament.
But Mr Wigley did leave the door ajar.
'There is no question of Plaid Cymru entering into a coalition,' he said.
'Our MPs would keep their hands free to consider every issue in the House of
Commons on its merits. We will consider the proposals in the first Queen's
Speech of the new parliament in the light of the policies in our manifesto.'
Plaid Cymru held three seats in the last parliament.
Mr Wigley was speaking as an NOP poll for HTV television suggested that
Labour would win the Tory-held marginal Cardiff Central by a big majority.
