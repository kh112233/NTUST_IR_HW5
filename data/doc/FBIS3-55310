  [Text] Supporters of deposed Georgian President Zviad 
Gamsakhurdia said he might be alive. 
  A source at the information center of Gamsakhurdia's rebels 
told Interfax that the conclusion was based on a careful 
analysis of the situation, but that the truth would be known 
after several days, for everything depended on whether a reply 
came from Gamsakhurdia himself, to whom an inquiry had been sent. 
  The source said those who had told Gamsakhurdia's wife 
Manana 
about his death had not been to western Georgia for two weeks. 
  The source said the rumors about Gamsakhurdia's suicide had 
apparently been launched by the Georgian leadership and had 
three aims: prepare a basis for his planned assassination, deal 
a mortal blow at the national liberation movement in western 
Georgia, and force Gamsakhurdia's closer relatives to return to 
Georgia in order to, by taking them hostage, force him to 
surrender to the authorities. 
  The source said the plot had had the opposite effect, 
Gamsakhurdia having received more support.
