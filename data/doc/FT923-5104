FT  03 SEP 92 / Slovaks adopt new constitution
SLOVAKIA has taken one more step towards independence with the adoption by
local MPs of a separate constitution for the republic, writes Ariane
Genillard. Articles on creating a Slovak central bank and on the border with
the Czech republic will be frozen until next January 1, thus avoiding any
violation of the current federal constitution.
Czech and Slovak leaders recently agreed on constitutional steps to
establish two independent states by the start of next year.
The new Slovak constitution caused considerable controversy in Bratislava,
the capital, and Slovak Hungarian parties walked out of the local
parliament. Leaders of the ethnic Hungarian minority in the republic - 12
per cent of the population - have warned about the discriminatory nature of
Slovakia's new nationalist government.
