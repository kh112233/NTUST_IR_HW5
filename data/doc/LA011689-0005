THE STATE; 
PILOTS HELD IN SMUGGLING 
The pilot and co-pilot of a Salvadoran jetliner were arrested at Los Angeles 
International Airport on suspicion of attempting to smuggle a cache of firearms 
to El Salvador. Customs agents said they recovered seven semiautomatic pistols 
and a .12-gauge semiautomatic shotgun after receiving a tip from an informant. 
The agents said it was not immediately determined whether the weapons were 
intended for any organized group. Special Customs agent Ed Adamson said the Los 
Angeles office received a tip Friday night saying that the cockpit crew of 
Flight 2511 of TACA International Airlines would be attempting to smuggle guns 
out of this country. Agents found the weapons in luggage being carried by two 
TACA flight attendants. Customs agents boarded the plane shortly before it was 
scheduled to take off and arrested pilot Francisco Jerez, 30, and co-pilot 
Francisco Panameno, 29, without incident. They were booked into the federal 
detention center in downtown Los Angeles on suspicion of violating the 
Neutrality Act, which prohibits the export of weaponry without a State 
Department license. Agents said the flight attendants, who apparently had no 
knowledge of the weapons, were not arrested. The airline had no immediate 
comment.
