FAMILY SPOTS: WHALE OF A TIME FOR YOUNG LANDLUBBERS 
Whale watching from land is an inspired arrangement for families. Not only is 
it cheaper than a boat trip, it allows antsy youngsters to walk around when 
they've reached the limit of their whale-watching enjoyment. The National Park 
Service opens its whale-watch station today at Point Dume State Preserve for a 
six-week session. 
Last year, two to 20 gray whales were spotted every Saturday and Sunday, often 
just 100 to 200 feet from shore. Naturalists will be on hand from 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m. to answer questions and provide information on whales, dolphins and other 
marine life. 
Although the whales can be spotted with the naked eye, the naturalists will 
have a few spotting scopes or binoculars. 
Even from land, visitors can observe "spouting" (the fountain-like spray), "spy 
hopping" (when the whale pokes its head out of the water to look around) and 
"breaching" (rising completely out of the water, turning sideways and falling 
back). 
The station is at the end of a sandy trail on an elevated area of coastline. It 
is not a difficult walk but is inaccessible to wheelchairs and strollers. Bring 
a picnic basket and enjoy lunch on the beach below. The station is open 10 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. weekends through March 26. 
Point Dume State Preserve is off Pacific Coast Highway, south of Zuma County 
Beach in Malibu. Information: (818) 888-3770.
