FT  06 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank: Clinton's Dollars 100m enterprise fund
President Bill Clinton yesterday launched a new Dollars 100m (Pounds 63.2m)
US enterprise fund to invest in small to medium-sized businesses in the
southern Africa region, reports George Graham from Washington.
Speaking on the White House lawn after a meeting with South African
President Nelson Mandela, Mr Clinton said the fund would be chaired by Mr
Andrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta and US ambassador to the UN.
Separately, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US government
agency charged with encouraging US investment overseas, announced that it
would provide political risk insurance for two private equity funds
totalling Dollars 150m to invest in southern Africa.
Mr Mandela has been winning considerable support from US venture capitalists
on his visit to the US, but no new direct US aid package beyond the Dollars
600m the Clinton administration has already committed to South Africa.
Mr Clinton said the next phase of that package would provide loans to
guarantee Dollars 500m in new housing construction, as well as Dollars 50m
to provide electricity and Dollars 30m for basic healthcare in South
Africa's poorest areas.
