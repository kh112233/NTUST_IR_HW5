COULD UPSET BALANCE OF FORCES; 
WEST WARY OF SWIFT PACE OF CHANGE IN EAST EUROPE 
It's just a political joke making the rounds of Hungarian coffee shops: The 
last Soviet division in Hungary should not be withdrawn, but rather redeployed 
to the southeast to keep the peace with Romania. 
"Except it's not that funny," said a Hungarian diplomat here. Romanian 
President Nicolae Ceausescu has twice hinted at his country's capacity to build 
nuclear weapons and is reportedly taking part in a program to develop a 
ballistic missile, the diplomat said. 
This the is new reality of Eastern Europe as President Bush leaves today for 
visits to Poland and Hungary. The dismantling of the Soviet empire, the last 
colonial empire in the world, is moving almost too fast, even for American 
comfort. 
Consequently, the post-World War II U.S. policy of containing communism, a 
reaction to the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe, is a dead letter. At least 
in Poland and Hungary, where Bush will travel, the political ideology and 
centrally planned economies of Marxism are being buried -- and age-old national 
and ethnic animosities are resurfacing in ways that recall the chaos of 
pre-World War I Europe. 
Washington may not be fully prepared for the consequences. 
"You call for tearing down the Berlin Wall," Henry Trofimenko of the Soviet 
Institute for the Study of United States told a recent conference here. "But 
then what?" 
The Bush Administration, reacting to the changes instituted by Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, put forward a new policy this spring called "beyond 
containment." Its goal is to eliminate the barriers between the two Europes, to 
ease the nations of Eastern Europe out of the Soviet orbit without blasting 
them out. 
Bush did not call on the Eastern European nations, for example, to leave the 
Warsaw Pact. That would change the balance of forces in Europe radically. 
Power Sharing Urged 
Likewise, a Polish diplomat said that during the recent negotiations between 
the Polish government and the Solidarity trade union, the United States urged 
"cooperation in the peaceful transition" to power sharing, not "breaking down 
the (communist) system." 
And the United States has put no particular pressure on East Germany, 
Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria, which have vigorously rejected the 
reformist course, to follow the examples of Poland and Hungary. 
But Bush has left no doubt about his goal. "The Cold War began in Central 
Europe, with the building of the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall," he said 
after the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit meeting in Brussels. 
"If the Cold War is to end, it will have to end where it began." 
Cautious on Interfering 
Until recently, the Soviets have had relatively few complaints about the new 
policy, in part because the Administration was very cautious about interfering 
in Eastern Europe. 
"We obviously do not want to promote instability in that region," explained a 
senior U.S. official. "Events there have gone beyond our resources. For the 
past decade, we have spent our wealth on military weapons that are useless in a 
situation that calls for economic aid." 
But last week Bush called for the unilateral withdrawal of all Soviet forces 
from Poland and, implicitly, from the entire region. That appears to have 
raised the hackles of Gorbachev as he visited France last week. 
If Eastern European nations want to remake their political and economic 
systems, Gorbachev said, that is the "internal affair" of the individual 
nations concerned. The changes should remain within a "socialist framework," he 
added, using a phrase he has used before without defining it. 
But then, in what was seen as a warning to Bush as he prepared to leave for 
Poland and Hungary, Gorbachev said that "the present political processes (in 
Eastern Europe) are positive, but they are complex and they are also fragile. 
They are subject to various risks, including destabilization and rupture." 
Anti-Soviet Demonstrations 
"Russians go home" demonstrations have already broken out in Hungarian and 
Polish cities. The most violent of them took place in Krakow, Poland, with 
bottles and other trash thrown at the Soviet Consulate. Moscow has chosen to 
ignore the provocation so far. 
But anti-Soviet emotions can quickly get out of hand, especially in the 
superheated mood generated by Bush's impending visit. If Bush appeals for a 
total Soviet troop withdrawal while visiting Poland, for example, that could 
provoke escalating attacks on the Soviets that Moscow could not ignore. 
Gorbachev reportedly told his French hosts what he has said privately to 
others: that the Soviets will not interfere in Eastern Europe as long as the 
West seeks no military advantage there. 
Consensus on Reforms 
The consensus among U.S. and foreign experts is that the best interests of 
Washington and Moscow will be served if the political, economic and social 
reforms in Eastern Europe -- some call them revolutions -- are peacefully 
managed. 
Any reversal of the process, and particularly any Soviet military intervention 
in Eastern Europe, would have far worse consequences than Moscow's previous 
invasions. It would plunge U.S.-Soviet relations into a new and deeper Cold War 
for at least the rest of the century, according to a senior U.S. official. 
It would also put an end to Gorbachev's internal reforms of perestroika 
(restructuring) and glasnost (openness), and to his "new thinking" in foreign 
policy, which has yielded the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and unilateral 
troop reductions in Eastern Europe. 
Intervention is most likely if the pressing economic problems of Poland and 
Hungary turn to riots. 
Looking for Bailout 
Neither nation can generate enough wealth to restructure its economy on its 
own. Both countries -- and the Soviets -- want the West to bail them out. 
But the West is insisting on continuing political and economic reforms as a 
condition for aid. At the Paris economic summit, which Bush will attend next 
weekend after leaving Hungary, the world's seven leading industrial democracies 
are expected to devise a cooperative economic plan to help Poland and Hungary. 
The four other Soviet Bloc nations -- Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany 
and Romania -- are in better economic shape today, but most experts predict 
they will soon have similar problems. 
"The main issue," said a Polish scholar who asked not to be named, "is how East 
Europe and even the Soviet Union itself can be integrated into the Western 
economic community." 
Multi-Party Systems 
Both Hungary and Poland are on the way to multi-party political systems with at 
least some of the trappings of market economies. Poland is more advanced 
politically, but its economic problems are so urgent and all-consuming that 
beyond solvency, its reformers have not laid out coherent national goals. 
Hungary has had greater success with economic reforms while moving slower 
toward political pluralism. Its long-term goal is to become the Sweden of 
Central Europe, according to Hungarian officials. They said the nation would be 
"a neutral, socialist democracy," operating under a constitution in which the 
legislative and judicial branches are separated from the executive. 
Communists Lack Majority 
That government would be leftist, with communists playing a major role but 
lacking an absolute majority in Parliament. The country would be owned 
one-third by the state, one-third by industrial and agricultural cooperatives, 
and one-third by private individuals or corporations, including foreign firms. 
Hungarians believe the Soviets would not object to these goals, even to 
neutrality of the country, in a decade or so. But they recognize the danger of 
Soviet intervention if they move too fast, particularly in seeking new security 
arrangements. 
The Kremlin would be less likely to accept the neutrality of Poland, a more 
strategic territory than Hungary. The critical supply lines to its forces in 
East Germany, considered the Soviets' most important ally in Eastern Europe, 
run through Poland. 
Soviet Forces in Poland 
"The Soviets tell us that stability in Poland is most important, even more 
important than Poland remaining communist," said a Polish diplomat. "They also 
indicate that they would want to move troops into Poland if there was a war." 
About 40,000 Soviet troops are now based in Poland, but they are logistical 
support personnel rather than combat forces. 
Least tolerable to the Soviets, experts believe, would be for either Hungary or 
Poland to leave the Warsaw Pact and join the NATO alliance, as Hungary seemed 
tempted to do in 1956. A Hungarian diplomat concluded: "Unless there was a 
profound military threat to the Soviet Union from Central Europe, we don't 
believe the Soviets would intervene." 
A Kremlin official was not so sure. Citing a Russian proverb, he said: 
"Everything is reversible in life, except time."
