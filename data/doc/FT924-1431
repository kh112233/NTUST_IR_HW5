FT  18 DEC 92 / Argentina's capital inflow tops Dollars 1bn
ARGENTINA'S central bank says capital inflows have topped Dollars 1bn so far
this month, a record since the country made its currency convertible in
April 1991. The record is all the more remarkable because in November the
country suffered its first sustained currency crisis in nearly two years.
A central bank official said yesterday the bank has added Dollars 1.008bn to
its reserves so far this month, bringing net capital inflows for this year
to Dollars 5.76bn. Between April and December last year, the central bank
bought Dollars 3.11bn in foreign currency.
To prevent a return to its tradition of heavy inflation and massive
devaluations, Argentina has made its central bank independent and pegged the
peso to the US dollar by law. Under this so-called convertibility law, the
central bank may print money only if it is fully backed by foreign currency,
gold or a limited quantity of government bonds.
Last month, investors, who were worried that economy minister Domingo
Cavallo's policies were unravelling and his grip on power slipping, bolted
for the exits by selling pesos, leading to a Dollars 230m net outflow of
funds, the first since Mr Cavallo took office in January 1991.
Although December's strong capital inflow is a sign of renewed confidence in
Mr Cavallo's policies, analysts warn investors are being attracted by high
interest rates that yesterday stood at 22 per cent a year in dollar terms.
They warn that once companies' traditional end-of-year demand for local
currency eases, the inflow of foreign capital may slow down sharply.
