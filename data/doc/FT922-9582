FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: VW net edges ahead to DM202m
PROFITS growth at Volkswagen, the German motor concern, lagged behind
turnover expansion in the first quarter of this year, with domestic earnings
showing a sharp drop.
VW, which is cutting jobs and reducing costs to improve competitiveness,
said group net income in the period was 3.5 per cent higher at DM202m
(Dollars 122m). Turnover grew by 11 per cent to DM21bn.
Earnings at the parent company, which reflect profitability of VW cars in
Germany, dropped 35 per cent to DM103m; last year, these were 33 per cent
lower at DM447m.
In the first four months, group vehicle deliveries were 5 per cent higher at
1.2m units. Mr Carl Hahn, chief executive, said VW would have a good year in
1992.
Mr Dieter Ullsperger, finance director, said VW had made full use of special
depreciation allowances carrying tax advantages. These were mainly related
to the geographical situation of VW's Wolfsburg headquarters, near the
border with the former East Germany, and previously subject to state
assistance.
He said profits were reduced by nearly DM3bn due to: DM340m in start-up
costs of new projects; the DM1.3bn expense of bringing the new Golf and
Vento family cars into production; and the special depreciation of DM1bn.
Pre-tax profits fell 25 per cent last year to DM1.8bn. Mr Ullsperger said
they would have shown a 25 per cent rise, to DM2.8bn, if the group had not
raised its depreciation provisions considerably.
Earnings per share were flat at DM36, while cash-flow was 25 per cent higher
at DM7.1bn. VW's high depreciation also cut its tax bill. Net profits,
therefore, showed a 2.6 per cent rise to DM1.1bn. Turnover in 1991 was 12
per cent higher at DM76bn. Group capital spending was 84 per cent higher at
DM9.9bn; Mr Hahn said this year's figure would be around DM12bn.
Total VW group output - including the up-market Audi subsidiary in Germany,
Seat in Spain, and Skoda in Czechoslovakia - would rise from 3.3m to 3.6m
units.
In the US, where VW makes a loss, competitiveness would be restored by
production of the new Golf and Vento models in Mexico. Sales in the first
four months were 4 per cent higher in the US, while Audi gained 40 per cent.
Audi's net profits last year were 30 per cent higher at DM370m. Mr Ferdinand
Piech, head of Audi, will become the new chief executive of the VW group
next year.
