  [Text] Presidential Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu 
held his weekly news conference at Cotroceni Palace today. 
Referring to the recent initiative of the Russian Federation, 
which, in the opinion of one of the journalists, has eased the 
situation in Sarajevo, Chebeleu said that our country salutes 
any action that leads to the calming down of the situation in 
that area and that supports the peace process. 
  Our correspondent, Sorin Croitorescu, reports that in the 
beginning of the news conference Mr. Chebeleu read out a 
statement referring to the arrest of a Craiova journalist, 
Nicolae Andrei [for having published two items allegedly 
offending President Ion Iliescu]. The statement says that the 
presidency has made no complaints incriminating that journalist, 
after which it notes that this is not a singular case in the 
Romanian press, despite the fact that one of the fundamental 
principles of democracy is the respect that ought to be shown to 
state authorities.
