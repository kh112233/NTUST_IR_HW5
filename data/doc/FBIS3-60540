  [Text] Donor blood: Even if there is no risk for Danish 
patients, the authorities are taking very seriously the matter 
of German blood that has not been HIV tested. 
  Danes must feel completely safe in the medicine they 
receive. 
  Therefore the Danish authorities will go through the 
country's hospitals and apothecaries with a fine-tooth comb 
looking for preparations of blood from the German blood bank UB 
Plasma Laboratory that have not been HIV tested. 
  Even if the preparations are in no case dangerous. 
<H5>  Every Detail </H5>
  ``We intend to show that we have examined every detail. 
Therefore we are checking to see whether any medical firms 
represented in Denmark can have bought blood products that have 
not been tested for the HIV virus,'' Eva Sandberg, a section 
head in the Health Department, said. 
  ``If there is, we will call the preparations back. We do not 
want to have any of that rubbish on the Danish market.'' 
  Sandberg stressed that as things stand now only blood that 
has been tested is used in Denmark. All imported blood is 
cleaned and heat treated--virus inactivated, as it is 
called--for example, 10 hours at 60 degrees centigrade. 
  ``The HIV virus is not very robust, so that a completely 
unimaginable concentration of the virus would be necessary for 
there to be a risk of any of it surviving,'' Sandberg said. 
  The Health Department has written to producers and importers 
of blood products in Denmark and asked them to answer as soon as 
possible whether they have used any of the ``risky'' deliverers. 
  Imported blood products are, for example, albumin, which is 
used for patients who have lost a great amount of blood, gamma 
globulin, which among other things is used to prevent liver 
infections, as well as factor products for bleeders. 
<H5>  Letter From Novo </H5>
  Among the large producers of blood preparations is 
Novo-Nordisk in Gentofte, which has already sent a letter of 
reply. Communications Chief Mike Rulis answers with a flat 
denial. 
  The largest of the rest of the producers is 
Seruminstituttet, 
and then come in random order Kabi Pharmacia, Beringvaerket, 
Sanders, and Immuno. 
  At Seruminstituttet only Director Leif Pallesen can reply. 
He 
could not be found this evening. 
<H5>  How Danish Blood Is Tested </H5>
  During the past eight years, all Danish blood has been 
screened, that is, tested for the AIDS virus and Hepatitis C and 
D. This is the way Danish blood is made safe: 
  1. Blood donors must be healthy and sound. They must not be 
taking medicine (birth control pills, headache pills, etc., are 
accepted). Homosexuals and drug addicts are rejected. After 
stays in areas of risk such as, for example, Africa, there is a 
period of quarantine. 
  2. All blood is tested for the AIDS virus (HIV), Hepatitis 
B, 
and Hepatitis C. 
  3. Blood for blood transfusions cannot tolerate heat 
treatment and is used directly, but is not mixed. Blood plasma 
for blood products (bleeder medicine, etc.) is mixed and treated 
thermally.
