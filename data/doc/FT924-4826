FT  01 DEC 92 / International Company News: Solvay acquires stake in
Japanese drugs specialist
SOLVAY, the Belgian chemical group, has acquired 96 per cent of the shares
in Kowa Yakuhin Kogyo of Japan, agencies report.
Kowa, a specialist in the production, development and distribution of human
health drugs in Japan, had sales of around Y3bn (Dollars 24m) in 1991.
Solvay said the acquisition would allow it to market its pharmaceutical
products directly in Japan, which represents around 20 per cent of the world
market.
The Belgian company is indirectly present in Japan through products sold
under Solvay licences by several Japanese companies, which represent annual
sales of around Y9bn.
Solvay has also been active through the Solvay Meiji Yakuhin joint venture,
set up in 1989, which has been developing a number of Solvay research and
development projects including the antidepressant fluvoxamine which will be
launched in Japan in 1996.
Solvay shares closed BFr100 higher at BFr11,150 on the Brussels stock
exchange.
Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
Solvay said Kowa Yakuhin, which had turnover of about Y3bn in 1991, was
preparing to launch a 'promising product' in the field of urology.
