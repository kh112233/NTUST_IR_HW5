FT  20 JAN 94 / Dawn raids in Cairo
More than 1,000 police commandos swept through Moslem militant hideouts in
southern Cairo yesterday in the biggest operation this year, Reuter reports
from Cairo.
One policeman and a militant were killed and two policemen and one militant
wounded in the dawn raids, the interior ministry said in a statement. At
least 60 suspected militants were arrested.
The government sent 15 to a military court on charges of belonging to the
illegal group which tried to kill Prime Minister Atef Sedki in a bomb attack
in November.
