FT  20 JUN 94 / International Company News: Anheuser expands Chinese
interests
Anheuser-Busch, the biggest brewer in the US, is continuing the
international assault on China's beer market with the planned takeover of
the Zhongde brewery in Wuhan on the Yangtze River.
The group, which produces Budweiser beer, has announced that it would take
an 80 per cent stake in the Wuhan brewery and expected the deal to be
completed by the end of this year.
Last year, Anheuser-Busch secured a 5 per cent stake in the Tsingtao
brewery, China's best known brewer and one of nine companies selected for a
listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
The US company's investment in the Wuhan brewery will be made through
Anheuser-Busch International and is part of aggressive expansion plans in
emerging markets.
It is certain to pay a premium price for its stake in the Zhongde
Chinese-German joint venture, which was established in 1988 and produces the
Steinbrau brand. It plans to use Wuhan as a base for production of
Budweiser.
Anheuser-Busch last year acquired a 17.7 per cent stake in Grupo Modelo,
Mexico's largest brewer for Dollars 477m. The Wuhan investment would be its
first majority stake abroad.
Foster's Brewing of Australia and Anheuser-Busch are leading the charge
among international brewers to secure a niche in the Chinese market, but
they are far from the only players.
San Miguel, Carlsberg, Becks, Pabst Blue Ribbon and Holstein are among
foreign companies who have either established joint ventures or licensing
arrangements with local brewers.
China is the world's third largest and fastest growing beer market. Per
capita consumption at 8.4 litres is negligible compared with 92 litres in
the US and 158 in Germany.
China last year produced 12m tons of beer, passing Germany to become the
world's second biggest producer after the US.
