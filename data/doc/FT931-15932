FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to beat the average
PAST performance has a bearing on the future, the Weekend FT's analysis of
unit trusts over 1991-92 concludes. Buying the best, or most consistent
performing unit trusts, appears to give the investor a better chance of
beating the average.
To test the theory, we assumed that an investor was selecting a unit trust
in October 1991, and chose, as his options:
One of the best 10 performing trusts in each sector over the previous year;
One of the worst 10 performing trusts in each sector over the previous year;
Trusts with a long record of consistency, ie those with an above average
performance in their sectors over one, two, three, five, seven and (where
possible) ten years.
All figures were taken from Finstat, on the basis of offer-to-bid with net
income reinvested.
The next step was to see how those selections performed over the year to
October 1992. The table shows the result, and includes the average for each
sector over the same period.
Choosing one of the best 10 trusts would have enabled the investor to bear
the sector average in nine out of the 14 categories, or 64.3 per cent. A
good example is the Far East (excluding Japan) where October 1991's top 10
funds rose by an average 18.1 per cent over the following year, compared
with the sector average of 10.8 per cent.
Buying each of the top 10 trusts in a sector would be cumbersome. But the
encouraging news is that the top trust over the previous year beat the
average in 10 out of 14 cases.
The theory that the worst performing unit trust in the sector might rebound
has often been a market favourite. The idea is that the management group
will put effort into improving a poorly performing fund, perhaps by changing
the manager. Funds have been launched with the main aim of investing in the
worst - performing unit trust of the previous year.
But the table does not give much succour to this theory. The 10 worst trusts
failed to beat the sector average on nine out of 14 occasions.
Consistency of performance might well be a better indicator of a manager's
skill than being top of the table over as short a period as a year. The
table shows that trusts selected on this basis beat the sector average on
seven out of 12 occasions - and beat the average of the 10 top performers in
six out of the 12 categories (in two sectors, no trust meet the consistency
criteria).
The table is only a rough-and-ready analysis, and does not claim to settle
an issue which has provoked much academic head-scratching in the past.
Statistics can easily mislead, as those who followed the opinion polls
during the last general election can attest.
But one further statistic might help convince the doubters. A single
calendar year is not an ideal period over which to measure a unit trust;
since trusts are long-term investments. So we also analysed how the investor
would have done had he backed the top performing fund over the two, three,
five and ten years to October 1.
In each case, the top performer would have beaten the sector average over
the following 12 months more times than not and, in the case of the three -
year champion, the average was beaten 11 out of 13 times.
