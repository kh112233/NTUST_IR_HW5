  [Excerpt] Most of the publicly-owned and independent 
newspapers cease publication today and tomorrow. This decision 
was made directly by the publishers following the armed attack 
on the premises of the L'HEBDO LIBERE weekly last Monday. 
  The attack led to the killing of a cameraman and one worker 
and the serious wounding of three other. The weekly's sources 
had said that one of the wounded, Nadir Mahmoudi, brother of the 
L'HEBDO LIBERE's director, died of his wounds. The papers 
involved are EL WATAN, EL MOUDJAHID, El HAQ, LA GAZETTE, 
CONFIDENCE, OLYMPIQUE, ALGER REPUBLICAIN, L'ECHO DU CENTRE and 
other newspapers. 
  This is the first time national newspapers are to cease 
publication for two consecutive days in protest against repeated 
armed attacks on journalists and media men. 
  The security issue, which is an aspect of the political 
crisis the country has experienced for over two years, is a 
source of concern for the government. The series of 
negotiations President Liamine Zeroual has been holding is 
expected to resume this week in the framework of the dialogue he 
had started since the beginning of last week aimed at seeking 
the best means to overcome the current crisis the country is 
experiencing. [passage omitted]
