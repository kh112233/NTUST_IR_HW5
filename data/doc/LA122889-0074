THEY'RE IN THE FUNNY MONEY 
For at least a moment, it must have seemed like Christmas came late to a 
northeast Los Angeles neighborhood Tuesday. 
Police responded to a 7:30 a.m. call about $20 bills "flying all over" Los 
Feliz Boulevard near Lowry Road, Officer Gene Hancock said. By the time 
officers arrived at the scene -- within six minutes -- the money was virtually 
gone. 
One problem, said Hancock. Turns out the bills were fake. 
"It was a good photographic copy of the money, but it was obviously the wrong 
kind of paper," he said. 
The police weren't the only ones who realized the money was funny. "People kept 
calling and saying, 'It's fake' and hanging up," Officer Cook Barela said. 
One woman brought in 41 of the $20 bills Wednesday morning, Hancock said. For 
others holding onto the fake cash, Hancock politely warns that possession of 
counterfeit currency is against the law. 
Police remain uncertain how much may have been scattered. And how the bills 
came to rest on Los Feliz Boulevard is still unexplained. 
It's not unusual for people to throw money around at Christmas, the officers 
noted. But Barela offered a few suggestions. 
"I think it was 'Totally Hidden Video,' " he said, referring to a current 
television show similar to "Candid Camera." "Either that, or a present from 
Noriega." LORI GRANGE
