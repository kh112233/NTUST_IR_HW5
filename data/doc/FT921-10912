FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Dow Corning declines 35.3% to
Dollars 29m
DOW CORNING, the US maker of silicon breast implants at the centre of a
controversy over their safety, yesterday reported a 35.3 per cent drop in
fourth-quarter 1991 net profit, to Dollars 28.9m.
The Michigan-based company, which is jointly owned by Dow Chemical, the
large chemicals group, and Corning, the glass products maker, said the
fourth-quarter results included a previously announced Dollars 25m pre-tax
charge related to the breast implant business.
Fourth-quarter revenues were Dollars 472.3m, compared with Dollars 449.2m in
the last quarter of 1990.
For the whole of 1991, Dow Corning's net income declined to Dollars 152.9m
from Dollars 171.1m the previous year. Revenues in 1991 were Dollars 1.85bn,
compared with Dollars 1.72bn in 1990.
Mr Lawrence Reed, chief executive of the company, said Dow Corning continued
to be in close contact with the US Food and Drug Administration and was
continuing to provide scientific information about the implants.
Controversy over the implants has escalated in recent weeks amid concern
over the product's safety.
Mr Reed yesterday claimed the implants are 'efficacious and have limited
risks and complications'.
Dow Corning recently hired Mr Griffin Bell, the former US Attorney-General,
to investigate the develop-ment and marketing of the implant.
