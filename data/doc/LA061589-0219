2 MORE CANADIAN ATHLETES SUSPENDED AFTER TESTING POSITIVE FOR STANOZOLOL 
Canadian weightlifter Bob Karsch has been suspended from competition for two 
years after testing positive for use of steroids, the Canadian Weightlifting 
Federation confirmed Wednesday night. 
Federation President Yvon Chouinard said a urine sample provided by Karsch at 
the national championships in Sarnia, Ontario, two weeks ago revealed traces of 
the anabolic steroid stanozolol, the same muscle-building drug used by sprinter 
Ben Johnson, who was banned for two years after testing positive at the Seoul 
Olympics. 
Earlier in the day, the Canadian Track and Field Assn. announced that national 
women's hurdles champion Julie Rocheleau-Baumann was suspended after a positive 
out-of-competition test, also for stanozolol.
