TERRORIST ABBAS DIRECTS THREAT AT PRO-WESTERN ARABS 
Palestinian guerrilla leader Abul Abbas has threatened unspecified reprisals 
against pro-Western Arab states in the Persian Gulf he accused of expelling 
Palestinian residents. 
Abbas, head of the Baghdad-based Palestine Liberation Front best known for 
masterminding the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship in the 
Mediterranean, accused some gulf states of repressive measures against 
Palestinians. 
"The repressive measures which have been committed against our people strike at 
the heart of the Palestinian issue.
