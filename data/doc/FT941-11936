FT  02 FEB 94 / Argentina to get US Skyhawks
Washington has finally agreed to sell Argentina 36 Skyhawk fighter bombers
to replace aircraft shot down in the 1982 Falklands conflict, despite
British opposition.
London opposed transfer of the aircraft, claiming they represented a threat
to the Falklands and would necessitate an expensive upgrading of the
islands' air defences.
However, in a statement Washington said the sale was 'a demonstration of the
excellent ties' with Argentina and its armed forces.
The government of President Carlos Menem has lobbied hard for the aircraft
and made the issue a test of its strongly pro-US foreign policy. Mr Guido di
Tella, foreign minister, said the sale was a clear sign of US confidence in
Argentina. Argentina's claim to the Falklands is a highly emotional domestic
issue.
