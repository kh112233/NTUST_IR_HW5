FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Falling down on health
and safety - In a Nutshell
Three-quarters of British companies are failing to comply with new health
and safety legislation six months after it came into force, a survey by the
Eagle Star insurance group showed.
The survey of health and safety managers from 185 companies - one-third
employing fewer than 100 people - revealed that only 23 per cent had fully
implemented the changes, which covered areas such as the use of visual
display screens and the manual handling of loads. And 44 per cent of
companies had yet to comply with the Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health regulations, which came into effect in 1989, Eagle Star said.
