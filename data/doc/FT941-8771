FT  18 FEB 94 / De Beers and GE indicted over diamond prices
General Electric, the American conglomerate, and an affiliate of De Beers
Consolidated Mines, the South African mining house, were yesterday indicted
by the US Justice Department on charges of conspiracy to fix the worldwide
price of industrial diamonds.
The move follows a two-year Justice Department anti-trust investigation,
during which GE and De Beers, which together control more than 80 per cent
of output of industrial diamonds, denied collusion.
GE said yesterday there had been no anti-trust violation by it or its
employees. It would defend the case and was confident it would prevail at
trial.
The Justice Department's investigation grew out of claims by Mr Edward
Russell, a former executive of GE's superabrasives division, which makes
diamonds, that he had been fired by GE for blowing the whistle on
price-fixing.
However, on Wednesday, days before Mr Russell's lawsuit against GE was due
to go to trial, he withdrew his allegations and said he was now aware that
'GE removed me based on its view of my performance, and not because I was a
whistleblower'. He added that he had no knowledge indicating that GE
personnel had violated anti-trust laws.
Despite this retraction, the Justice Department yesterday filed an
indictment in the federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, against GE and
De Beers Centenary AG, as well as Mr Peter Frenz, a GE employee in Europe,
and Mr Philippe Liotier, a De Beers official.
It alleges that the conspiracy to fix prices began as early as 1991 and
continued through some time in 1992, and aimed to raise the list price of
various diamond products.
GE said 'the government is now trying to salvage its effort by bringing a
wholly circumstantial case of indirect price fixing that is without merit'.
