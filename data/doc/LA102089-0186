PISA TOWER PERIL SEEN 
Italy should close the Leaning Tower of Pisa because it is a danger to 
tourists, government-appointed experts said today. Public Works Minister 
Giovanni Prandini, responsible for the 800-year-old tower, said in September 
that something must be done urgently about its tilt and asked the committee to 
come up with ideas within a month.
