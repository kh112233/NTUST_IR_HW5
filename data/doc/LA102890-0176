BEIRUT PRESS MARKS HOSTAGE ANDERSON'S BIRTHDAY 
Lebanese newspapers published birthday letters to American Terry A. Anderson on 
Saturday, his 43rd birthday and his sixth in captivity. One newspaper reported 
that fellow hostage Terry Waite will be freed soon. 
Seven newspapers printed birthday greetings to Anderson from his sister, Peggy 
Say, his youngest daughter, Sulome, and Madeleine, Sulome's mother. They 
published the original English text so that Anderson, who did not know Arabic 
when he was kidnaped, would be able to read them if his kidnapers allow him to. 
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press, is the 
longest-held of the 11 Western hostages in Lebanon. He was kidnaped March 16, 
1985, by a pro-Iranian group known as Islamic Jihad. 
The newspaper Al Diyar, meanwhile, said British hostage Terry Waite will be 
freed either "by the end of this month or within the first half of the coming 
November, at the latest." 
The short, front-page report attributed the information to an unnamed security 
source. The conservative Al Diyar is not known to have special insight into the 
hostage issue, but the report was the latest predicting Waite's release since 
Iran and Britain agreed Sept. 27 to restore diplomatic ties. 
Waite, 51, an Anglican Church envoy, was kidnaped Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving 
his West Beirut hotel to negotiate with representatives of Anderson's 
kidnapers. Like Anderson, he is believed to be held by Islamic Jihad.
