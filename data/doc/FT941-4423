FT  11 MAR 94 / Tunnel start day still a mystery
Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, is still unable to give a starting
date for its services but expects to be open before the start of the summer
season, Mr Andre Benard, co-chairman said yesterday.
He told a meeting of the French Chamber of Commerce in London that the
company still had to solve a range of problems involving its mechanical,
electrical and computer systems.
Most of the problems involved rolling stock but there were also difficulties
with the fixed systems.
Delays in commissioning the Channel tunnel's operating systems have forced
Eurotunnel to postpone its opening, prompting fears that it could miss the
crucial summer season for passenger journeys.
Freight services were expected to start on March 7 but all that Eurotunnel
has been able to say is that it expects them to start before the official
opening on May 6. Through passenger services between London Waterloo, Paris
and Brussels are expected to start some time in the summer.
Mr Benard said: 'The fixed equipment has been nearly debugged but the
rolling stock has not. We want to be sure we can commission (the trains)
before we go out and give a date. We are making a lot of progress. Problems
are being corrected but it takes time.
'We are confident that the system is sound and it will operate as planned.
There is nothing fundamentally wrong but there are tricky little problems
which need to be solved in a reliable way.'
Mr Benard said Eurotunnel has approached 750 road hauliers in the UK and
more than 1,000 on the Continent of which more than 500 had opened accounts.
