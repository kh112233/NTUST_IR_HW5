FT  08 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Clash threatens dam project
Work on a multi-million-dollar dam project in Malaysia in which the British
company Balfour Beatty has a major share is threatened by arguments between
local authorities and the country's main electricity company, writes Kieran
Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
The authorities in the state of Kelantan, on Malaysia's east coast, have
blocked roads leading to the Dollars 710m Pergau hydro-electric dam.
Kelantan, a Moslem state controlled by the opposition Parti Islam, is in
dispute with Tenaga Nasional, the recently-privatised electricity utility,
over payments of water rights.
