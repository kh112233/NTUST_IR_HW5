<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The invention listed below is owned by an agency of the U.S. Government and is available for licensing in the U.S. in
accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 to achieve expeditious commercialization of results of federally funded research
and development.



U.S. Patent Application Number 08/153,930, filed November 15, 1993, and entitled ``Method and Apparatus To Characterize
Ultrasonically Reflective Contrast Agents''_The present invention relates in general to a method and apparatus
for characterizing the time and frequency response of ultrasonically reflective contrast agents.

The present invention is a method and apparatus for characterizing the time and frequency response of an ultrasonically
reflective contrast agent. An ultrasonically reflective contrast agent is injected, under constant pressure,
into a fluid flowing through a pump flow circuit. The fluid and the ultrasonically reflective contrast agent are uniformly
mixed in a mixing chamber, and the uniform mixture is passed through a contrast agent chamber. The contrast agent chamber
is acoustically and axially interposed between an ultrasonic transducer chamber and an acoustic isolation chamber.
A pulse of ultrasonic energy is transmitted into the contrast agent chamber from the ultrasonic transducer chamber.
An echo waveform is received from the ultrasonically reflective contrast agent, and it is analyzed to determine the
time and frequency response of the ultrasonically reflective contrast agent.

The invention claimed in this patent application is available for licensing on an exclusive, partially exclusive
or nonexclusive basis for upfront, running and annual minimum royalty payments to a partner committed to commercializing
this technology.
