  [Text] Paris, March 27 (AFP) -- Libya is pledged to comply 
with a court order to quit the disputed Aouzou Strip, but wants 
the Organisation of African Unity [OAU] to supervise the 
pullout, Libya's foreign secretary told AFP Saturday [27 March]. 
  Sa'd Mujbir [an official of the Libyan parliament] said 
Libya 
had accepted the February 3 ruling by the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague in favour of Chad's territorial claims to 
the Aouzou Strip, which Libya has occupied for the past 20 years. 
  "There's no question of reneging," he said. "But we want to 
withdraw within the rules in such a way as to avoid future 
conflict, preserving the dignity of all parties." 
  He said the OAU should act fast to supervise the withdrawal, 
saying Libya had asked current OAU chairman Egypt to put 
together a team of observers to carry out the task. 
  He rejected claims by Ndjamena that Libya was setting 
preconditions for a withdrawal, and denied that Libya was 
sending reinforcements to the territory.
