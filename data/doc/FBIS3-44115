  [Text] Botswana's foreign minister, Legwaila wa Legwaila, 
has negotiated a truce between Lesotho's warring army factions 
in overnight talks. Lesotho's prime minister, Ntsu Mokhehle, 
said the two sides had agreed in principle to lay down their 
arms, but the situation had not yet been fully resolved. Mr. 
Legwaila, who was in the Lesotho capital on behalf of the 
Organization of African Unity, returned to Gaborone early this 
morning, leaving behind calm but tense conditions in Maseru. 
Labor and church organizations have called for a national 
stayaway from work tomorrow to protest against the death of 
three civilians, blamed on the government's mishandling of the 
crisis.
