FT  10 APR 92 / Attack on foreigners' tax reporting in US
THE US Congress is taking aim once again at what it believes to be
widespread evasion of US taxes by foreign-owned businesses.
Various Congress members claim that foreign companies are systematically
understating the earnings of their US subsidiaries, and so evading US
corporate income taxes, by using inflated transfer prices to siphon profits
back to their home base.
In a hearing at the House ways and means committee yesterday, methods to
plug this hole were suggested, ranging from a new border tax to an
alternative minimum tax levied at 5 per cent of sales on foreign
subsidiaries.
However, officials from the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service urged
Congress not to press ahead with new legislation until they have had time to
see whether reforms on transfer pricing, enacted in 1990, have worked.
Mr Alan Wilensky, Treasury deputy assistant secretary for tax policy,
acknowledged that foreign-owned businesses showed a much lower rate of
return on assets than comparable US-owned companies, but warned that the US
might face retaliation if it were to introduce rules that discriminated
against foreign companies.
New tax data for 1989 - before the new 1990 rules took effect - showed that
foreign-controlled companies made an average return of 0.51 per cent of
assets, compared with 1.97 per cent for US-controlled companies.
Congressman Duncan Hunter argued that the US Treasury was losing more than
Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.4bn) a year because foreign companies were
artificially lowering their US profits.
