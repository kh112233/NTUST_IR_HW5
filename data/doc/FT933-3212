FT  15 SEP 93 / Labour starts review of education system
LABOUR yesterday launched what it called 'the biggest consultation of the
education profession since 1944'. Its education policy paper was intended to
lead to a 'national consensus'.
Mr John Smith, party leader, said the next Labour government would be an
'education government'. He added: 'Ministers, for the most part, do not use
the state system for their own children and therefore have no personal or
vested interest in its success.'
The party was keen to contrast its approach with the government's stance
which has led to confrontation with the teachers' unions over national
curriculum testing.
Labour's 'green paper' on education had been planned for several months. The
launch came after claims that the party had failed to capitalise on the
political difficulties of Mr John Patten, education secretary.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said detailed policies would
await further consultation, but that the main structure was in place. The
party intends to:
Reject the 'prescriptive national syllabus approach' - Labour will open
debate on the purpose as well as the content of the national curriculum.
Return grant-maintained schools to local education authority control.
Reject proposals to 'de-professionalise teaching' by allowing non-graduate
entry routes.
Abandon 'discredited and meaningless' league tables of schools' examination
results.
Abolish national tests which have the sole aim of producing 'simplistic
league tables'.
Mr Patten attacked the proposals as a 'so-called consultation paper that
actually gives the answers before the consultation has taken place'. He
said: 'It's back to the educational past for Labour.'
Teachers' unions welcomed the proposals, however. The Association of
Teachers and Lecturers, which is not affiliated to the TUC, said that it
would be 'delighted to be given a proper consultation over education
policy'.
