FT  14 FEB 94 / Breakthrough hopes for vaccine against malaria
Scientists yesterday reported significant promise in the century-long
struggle to develop a vaccine against malaria, Reuter reports. Malaria kills
up to 1m children a year in Africa, and there are up to 500m cases of the
disease each year globally. The disease is showing resistance to drugs
traditionally used to treat it.
Scientists working for a tropical disease programme jointly sponsored by the
UN Development Programme, World Bank and World Health Organisation said a
vaccine known as SPf66 has shown promising results in first phases of human
trials in a region of Africa.
