FT  22 FEB 93 / Letter: Closures part of a pattern
Sir, Your editorial on the proposed changes to the NHS in London ('Health
care in London', February 17) presents the controversial hospital plans as
'rationalisation'. This was certainly one feature but severe cuts were also
part of the package - 2,500 acute bed closures despite 132,000 Londoners on
waiting lists. For similar closures, the King's Fund estimated the annual
savings at Pounds 200m.
When it is realised that closure of several thousand other acute hospital
beds throughout Britain is currently planned, (for instance, 1,000 in
Edinburgh and in Glasgow, 500-1,000 in Liverpool), the London proposals are
seen as part of a pattern.
That pattern will delight a far-sighted Treasury, inflate waiting lists and
further fuel commercial medicine.
It would be most useful if the FT were to publish a national survey of these
planned closures and the estimated financial savings.
