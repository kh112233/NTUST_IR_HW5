FT  11 JUN 93 / W Europe 'must tackle joblessness'
WESTERN Europe must tackle high unemployment if it is to compete in the
modern world economy, Mr Gary Becker, Nobel economics prize winner said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Madrid.
'Europe has an essentially skilled work-force but its jobless rate is
unnecessarily high and must be overcome for it to succeed as well as it
might,' Mr Becker told a business seminar.
Western Europe's jobless rate has been running at an average 9 per cent over
the past five years.
Mr Becker, who won last year's Nobel economics prize, said that in a free
trade era countries with the best-trained people will compete most
efficiently, provided companies are not stifled by employment taxes.
He said a serious by-product of unemployment is that those out of work are
not getting trained, and they lose skills. 'The unemployed have no
opportunity to learn on the job, and the skills they learned on the job are
gradually lost.'
