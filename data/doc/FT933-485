FT  29 SEP 93 / World Trade News: South African venture for UK food
subsidiary
PILLSBURY, the US subsidiary of UK food, drinks and retailing group Grand
Metropolitan, announced yesterday the creation of a joint venture with
Foodcorp of Johannesburg to manufacture and sell Pillsbury products in
southern Africa.
The announcement of the agreement, the terms of which were not disclosed,
came just three days after Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African
National Congress, called for the removal of all remaining economic
sanctions against South Africa.
Former President Bush lifted federal restrictions against investing in South
Africa in 1991, but many state and city governments across the US maintain
some form of sanctions against the country.
Pillsbury said it would form the new company, called Pillsbury Africa with
Foodcorp's Table Top unit, South Africa's leading branded vegetable business
and the top producer of frozen vegetables.
The joint venture will manufacture Pillsbury's green giant vegetable
products and Pillsbury baked goods at Table Top's plants in the cities of
George and Port Elizabeth in the eastern Cape province. A 'significant'
number of local jobs would be created over the next three years, said
Pillsbury. The US group said it hoped the venture would provide a
springboard into other African markets.
