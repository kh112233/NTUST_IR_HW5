FT  01 JUN 94 / Associated to spend up to Pounds 50m on cable
Associated Newspapers plans to spend up to Pounds 50m over a number of years
to create Channel One, its new cable television channel aimed at cable
subscribers in London.
The owner of the Daily Mail and London's Evening Standard intends to launch
the channel in November on the London Interconnect Network, which links the
cable franchises of London.
There are 205,000 cable subscribers in the capital region - although the
total will almost certainly be higher when the channel is launched.
The investment cost has been pushed up from about Pounds 30m as the plans
have moved towards a considerable emphasis on news. Previous plans were more
entertainment-based.
The increased cost and the move towards news persuaded Mr Allan McKeown,
chief executive of SelecTv, to drop out of the project. Mr McKeown, whose
company has produced programmes such as Birds of a Feather, intended to take
a 20 per cent stake.
SelecTv plans to set up its own cable venture, The People's Channel, which
will use a lot of library material and will have a maximum cable requirement
of Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m.
Associated, which will get a monthly fee for each subscriber, is clearly
hoping to take a version of the channel to other large urban areas which are
being cabled. Channel One is seen as a long-term strategic investment by the
company.
According to official Independent Television Commission figures 642,377
homes are connected to modern cable networks. But although more cable is
being laid, the penetration rate - the proportion of those subscribing to
those who could - of 21.5 per cent has not risen over the past year.
Channel One can only be seen as a long-term strategic investment by
Associated, whose chairman Lord Rothermere has been determined for some time
to increase the group's presence in the electronic media.
