  [Text] Bratislava, March 15 (CTK) -- The Slovak Syndicate 
of Journalists (SSN) today called for police protection for 
their members against angry crowds after two reporters were 
beaten up while covering a demonstration in Bratislava on Monday 
[14 March]. 
  "Incidents of physical violence in the last few days ranks 
Slovakia amongst countries where freedom of speech and thought 
is not guaranteed," an SSN statement obtained by CTK reads. 
  An angry mob participating in a demonstration outside the 
residence of President Michal Kovac yesterday evening beat up 
two reporters working for Radio Free Europe (RFE). One of them, 
Stefan Hrib, was taken to hospital for examination after being 
kicked to the ground and having his bag stolen. An RFE editor 
and her colleague from Slovak Radio were also attacked. The 
journalists later accused the police of refusing to help. 
  Slovak deputy Ludovit Cernak, who is taking part in the 
discussions on the formation of a new government, said he was 
"surprised by the activity of the security forces" and added 
that, judging by what had happened during the demonstration, not 
one of ministers responsible for the police would qualify for a 
seat in the new government.
