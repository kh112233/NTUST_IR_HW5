&bull;For code 996.89 (Complications of other specified organ transplant) V42.8 (Other specified organ or tissue

All of the changes discussed above have been added to Table 6f, Additions to the CC Exclusions List, in section V of the
addendum to this proposed rule. 

Tables 6f and 6g in section V of the addendum to this proposed rule contain the proposed revisions to the CC Exclusions
List that would be effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994. Each table shows the principal diagnoses
with proposed changes to the excluded CCs. Each of these principal diagnoses is shown with an asterisk and the additions
or deletions to the CC Exclusions List are provided in an indented column immediately following the affected principal
diagnosis. 

CCs that are added to the list are in Table 6f_Additions to the CC Exclusions List. Beginning with discharges on or after
October 1, 1994, the indented diagnoses will not be recognized by the GROUPER as valid CCs for the asterisked principal
diagnosis. 

CCs that are deleted from the list are in Table 6g_Deletions from the CC Exclusions List. Beginning with discharges
on or after October 1, 1994, the indented diagnoses will be recognized by the GROUPER as valid CCs for the asterisked
principal diagnosis. 

Copies of the original CC Exclusions List applicable to FY 1988 can be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS) of the Department of Commerce. It is available in hard copy for $84.00 and on microfiche for $20.50,
plus $3.00 for shipping and handling. A request for the FY 1988 CC Exclusions List (which should include the identification
accession number, (PB) 88133970) should be made to the following address: National Technical Information
Service; United States Department of Commerce; 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161; or by calling
(703) 4874650. 

Users should be aware of the fact that all revisions to the CC Exclusions List (FYs 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, and
1994) and those in Tables 6f and 6g of this document must be incorporated into the list purchased from NTIS in 
order to obtain the CC Exclusions List applicable for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994. 

Alternatively, the complete documentation of the GROUPER logic, including the current CC Exclusions List, is available
from 3M/Health Information Systems (HIS), which, under contract with HCFA, is responsible for updating and maintaining
the GROUPER program. The current DRG Definitions Manual, Version 11.0, is available for $195.00, which includes
$15.00 for shipping and handling. Version 12.0 of this manual, which will include the changes proposed 
in this document as finalized in response to public comment, will be available in September 1994 for $195.00. These
manuals may be obtained by writing 3M/HIS at: 100 Barnes Road; Wallingford, Connecticut 06492; or by calling (203)

6. Review of Procedure Codes in DRGs 468, 476, and 477 



Each year, we review cases assigned to DRG 468 (Extensive OR Procedure Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis), DRG 476
(Prostatic OR procedure Unrelated to Principal Diagnosis), and DRG 477 (Nonextensive OR Procedure Unrelated 
to Principal Diagnosis) in order to determine whether procedures are properly assigned among these DRGs. 

DRGs 468, 476, and 477 are reserved for those cases in which none of the OR procedures performed is related to the principal
diagnosis. These DRGs are intended to capture atypical cases, that is, those cases not occurring with 
sufficient frequency to represent a distinct, recognizable clinical group. DRG 476 is assigned to those discharges
in which one or more of the following prostatic procedures are performed and are unrelated to the principal diagnosis:

 


60.0_Incision of prostate 
60.12_Open biopsy of prostate 
60.15_Biopsy of periprostatic tissue 
60.18_Other diagnostic procedures on prostate and periprostatic tissue 
60.2_Transurethral prostatectomy 
60.61_Local excision of lesion of prostate 
60.69_Prostatectomy NEC 
60.81_Incision of periprostatic tissue 
60.82_Excision of periprostatic tissue 
60.93_Repair of prostate 
60.94_Control of (postoperative) hemorrhage of prostate 
60.95_Transurethral balloon dilation of the prostratic urethra 
60.99_Other operations on prostate 



All remaining OR procedures are assigned to DRGs 468 and 477, with DRG 477 assigned to those discharges in which the
only procedures performed are nonextensive procedures that are unrelated to the principal diagnosis. The original
list of the ICD9CM procedure codes for the procedures we consider nonextensive procedures if performed
with an unrelated principal diagnosis was published in Table 6C in section IV of the addendum to the September 30, 1988
final rule (53 FR 38591). As part of the final rules published on September 4, 1990, August 30, 1991, September 1, 1992,
and September 1, 1993, we moved several other procedures from DRG 468 to 477. (See 55 FR 36135, 56 FR 43212, 57 FR 23625,
and 58 FR 46279, respectively.) 



a. Adding Procedure Codes to MDCs.

 We annually conduct a review of procedures producing DRG 468 or 477 assignments on the basis of volume of cases in these
DRGs with each procedure. Our medical consultants then identify those procedures occurring in conjunction with
certain principal diagnoses with sufficient frequency to justify adding them to one of the surgical DRGs for the MDC
in which the diagnosis falls. On the basis of this review, 
we are proposing the following DRG classification changes in order to reduce unnecessary assignment of cases to DRG
468 or 477.
