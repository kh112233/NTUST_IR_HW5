FT  29 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: French fishermen abduct Royal Navy
officers
Three Royal Navy officers were returned to their ship yesterday after being
abducted by French fishermen. The officers, from the fishery protection ship
HMS Brocklesby, suspected the French trawler of illegal fishing and boarded
it off Alderney. La Calypso ignored orders to make for Guernsey and headed
for Cherbourg with the officers on board. It was the second time in three
days that a French fishing boat had been challenged inside the Channel
Islands' six mile limit. Later French fishermen seized the Royal Navy patrol
boat HMS Blazer in Cherbourg harbour, where it was on a goodwill visit. They
held the vessel for three hours and burnt its white ensign flag.
