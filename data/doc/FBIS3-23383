  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A team from the Islamic Group 
attacked a tourist boat on the morning of 'Id al-Fitr [13 March] 
near the Island of Mijris, Markaz Sidfa, directly opposite 
al-Badari Island. The same boat came under another attack half 
an hour later near Asyut. The boat's guards exchanged fire with 
the terrorists, who fled in the direction of al-Badari Island. 
  On the same day, the Islamic Group issued a statement 
justifying its operations by saying that they were in 
retaliation for the massacres of Bosnia's Muslims. 
  The group distributed the statement in Asyut and al-Minya 
immediately after the 'Id al-Fitr prayers. It threatened to 
continue the jihad despite the military trials and arrests. 
  Appealing to Muslim religious scholars, the group said in 
its 
statement: To our ulemas who are feigning sorrow over national 
unity with the Orthodox Christians in Egypt and traveling across 
the country to attack the Muslim youths and excuse the regime's 
mistakes, we say that the international news agencies have 
feigned sorrow over the 200,000 Muslims butchered by Orthodox 
Serbs, the more than 50,000 Muslim women and girls publicly 
raped, and the thousands of children buried alive, slaughtered, 
or placed in cement mixers and fodder mills. What have you done? 
  The statement also appealed to police officers to join the 
Islamic Group. 
  The statement did not refer once to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque 
in 
Hebron despite its lengthy talk on Bosnia and the mujahidin in 
Algeria, Tunisia, Kashmir, Libya, Burma, Morocco, Iraq, and 
Syria. [passage omitted]
