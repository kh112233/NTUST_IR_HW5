  [Text] A spokesman for the National Peacekeeping Force says 
that the situation at Thokoza on the East Rand is still very 
tense following yesterday's gun battle between residents of 
Thokoza Hostel and members of the force. Late yesterday 
security forces cordoned off the area surrounding Thokoza 
Hostel. A well known newspaper photographer, Mr. Ken 
Oosterbroek was killed and two of his colleagues were wounded in 
yesterday's shooting. The two wounded journalists and two 
members of the peace keeping force who were also injured are out 
of danger. 
  Meanwhile there is controversy regarding Mr. Oosterbroek's 
wounds. A doctor at the Natalspruit Hospital says that Mr. 
Oosterbroek's body has no bullet wounds. However, THE STAR 
newspaper says that he died of a bullet wound to the chest. Dr. 
Dimitrius Paguiges said that the photographer's neck had been 
broken. A post mortem is to be held tomorrow. Journalists at 
the scene said that they believe the shots that had struck their 
colleagues had been fired by members of the National 
Peacekeeping Force. 
  Mr. Oosterbroek's death has been widely condemned. The 
National Party, the ANC, the DP [Democratic Party] and the PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] have expressed their condolences with 
his family and friends, and have repeated that attacks on 
journalists are unacceptable. The South African Union of 
Journalists and the media worker's union, MWASA [Media Worker 
Association of South Africa], condemned the violence, while the 
police on the East Rand said that they were deeply shocked by 
the tragic news. Newspapers and news agencies, including the 
BBC and REUTERS, have also expressed their condolences.
