FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Indian iron project planned
MUKAND, the Bombay-based subsidiary of Bajaj - India's fourth largest group
 -is ready to set up a sponge iron plant in Maharashtra state in a joint
venture with Bharat Forge, part of the Pune-based Kalyani iron and steel
group.
The companies are engaged in talks aimed at reaching an agreement on
building a Rs6.5bn (Dollars 225.6m) plant producing 800,000 tonnes of hot
briquetted iron a year.
Mukand already operates the largest electric arc furnace in India, while
Bharat Forge has the largest forge in the country's private sector.
The groups are among the largest buyers of sponge iron and scrap in India.
Once the new plant comes on stream, at least 70 per cent of its capacity
will service the raw material needs of the companies.
The new facility is expected to be a setback for the growth plans of Essar
Gujarat, the Ruia group company which was hoping to supply Mukand with at
least half the capacity of its huge new sponge iron plant at Hazira.
The joint venture also puts a question mark over other plans by the
companies. Earlier, both Mukand and Bharat Forge announced ambitious plans
to build large integrated steel plants. These may well now be shelved.
Meanwhile, Indian government studies anticipate a six-fold rise in sponge
iron production over the next three years.
