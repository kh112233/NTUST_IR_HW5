Exxon Corp. abruptly ceased its wildlife rescue and collection efforts off 
environmentally battered Kodiak Island, Alaska, despite a new wave of bird 
deaths there. The firm had already been under fire for deciding to end the 
overall cleanup of its March 24 oil spill by mid-September. The early quitting 
date at the start of the fall bird migration surprised and angered the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, said Paul Burke, assistant spill coordinator for the 
agency in Kodiak. There has been no official response to the criticism from 
Exxon. "We are considering a response," said Ann Frechette, an Exxon 
spokeswoman in Valdez.
