FT  08 JUL 92 / Tunnel sleeper trains approved
BRITISH RAIL'S plans to run sleeper night trains through the Channel tunnel
were yesterday given provisional approval by the European Commission.
The EC's competition directorate indicated that it was prepared to let the
services go ahead provided BR and its Continental national railway partners
did not attempt to bar other train operators from setting up in competition.
