ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA ANA; 
PRINTER ADMITS GUILT IN COUNTERFEITING CASE 
A Costa Mesa printer pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges of forging almost $10 
million in cash in what authorities say was one of the biggest counterfeiting 
schemes in U.S. history. 
Tracing a trail of phony cash spotted in Orange, Los Angeles and Riverside 
counties, federal prosecutors charged after his arrest in April that Hal J. 
Stepanich, 33, produced the fake cash in a garage near Palm Springs, using 
about $10,000 in printing equipment. 
Authorities described the product -- in denominations of $20, $50, and $100 -- 
as passable to the untrained eye, but could be spotted under expert inspection 
because of discrepancies on the back of the bills. They believe that the bulk 
of the phony currency was recovered from a Costa Mesa hiding place before 
entering circulation. 
Stepanich, who worked as a pressman at a Costa Mesa print shop until February, 
was to have gone on trial beginning Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Santa 
Ana. Instead, he changed his plea to guilty after reaching an agreement last 
week with federal prosecutors. 
Prosecutors agreed to recognize Stepanich's cooperation in leading authorities 
to the hidden cash after his April arrest and providing other information. That 
acknowledgement by prosecutors may help him at his Sept. 26 sentencing, his 
attorney said. Stepanich could face more than three years in prison on the 
counterfeiting conviction under federal sentencing guidelines. 
Another former Orange County man who allegedly conspired in the plot, Richard 
L. Wattel, 62, pleaded guilty earlier this month in U.S. District Court in 
Houston to two counterfeit-related charges, court officials there said Tuesday. 
A longtime friend of the Stepanich family, Wattel is to be sentenced Sept. 11.
