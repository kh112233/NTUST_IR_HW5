FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sales rise, but Lilly still
posts loss
Eli Lilly, the US drugs group, recorded faster-than-expected sales growth of
9 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn in the last quarter of 1993 compared with a year
before. But Dollars 1.2bn of restructuring and other charges dragged the
group into loss.
The higher sales were supported by products such as Axid, Humatrope, Prozac
and Vancocin, the company said. Sales of Ceclor, an antibiotic which is
Lilly's second-biggest product after Prozac, the anti-depressant, declined
slightly during the year, it added.
Due to previously announced charges, the company reported a net loss for the
quarter of Dollars 523.6m, or Dollars 1.77 a share. Excluding one-off items,
net income would have risen to Dollars 332.4m, or Dollars 1.14, from Dollars
311.1m, or Dollars 1.06, a year ago, when Lilly took restructuring charges
of Dollars 46.1m pre-tax.
Like other companies, Lilly has experienced a slow-down in the US market.
Sales there last year grew by 4 per cent, held back by 'downward pressure on
prices resulting from Medicaid rebates, which increased to Dollars 156m, and
greater participation in managed care programmes'.
Sales outside the US grew by 6 per cent, taking overall sales up 5 per cent
to Dollars 6.5bn. Pharmaceuticals accounted for Dollars 4.75bn, up 7 per
cent, and medical devices and diagnostics - earmarked for disposal - for
Dollars 1.25bn, up 4 per cent.
For the year as a whole, net income fell to Dollars 480m, or Dollars 1.63,
from Dollars 709m, or Dollars 2.41, in 1992.
