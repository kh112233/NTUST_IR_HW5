    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 26 
April. 
  The National Statistics Institute has reported inflation 
reached 3.7 percent during the first three months of the year. 
The institute has stated goods and services in the education 
sector registered the highest increase in prices. (Mexico City

  Tourism sector representatives have reported 40 percent of 
tourism reservations have been canceled due to the U.S. State 
Department's travel advisory following violent actions against 
U.S. citizens. The losses might reach $100 million. During 
1993 560,000 tourists entered the country, and the goal for 1994 
had been 600,000, a figure that is now unlikely to be achieved. 
Tourism was the second leading source of foreign exchange for 
Guatemala during 1993. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1133 GMT 26 Apr 94)
