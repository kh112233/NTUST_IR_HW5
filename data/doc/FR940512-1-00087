ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 HUD is proposing to amend its regulations regarding the elimination of hazards due to lead-based paint and inviting
public comments on the amendments. The amendments would remedy inaccuracies and respond to advancements in the state
of knowledge in the field of lead-based paint testing and hazard reduction. This proposed rule would amend both the
Department's basic regulation concerning lead-based paint poisoning prevention in residential structures and
additional regulations pertaining to specific programs of the Department. The changes would include revising the
definitions of an elevated blood-lead level, defective paint and chewable paint; redefining the age of concern for
children subject to lead hazards; providing definitions of hazard reduction methods; adding the option to test defective
paint surfaces and permitting the use of laboratory analysis such as atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS); modifying
approved abatement practices to control lead-based paint dust; revising requirements pertaining to the number
of dwelling units to be sampled under the random sampling provision.
