2 CAPTURED AFTER SANTEE JAIL ESCAPE 
Two inmates at the Las Colinas Men's Detention Facility in Santee escaped 
Monday night, but sheriff's deputies found them about an hour later less than 
200 yards away. 
Michael Clark and Donavan Chapman, both 19, escaped about 9:45 p.m. by throwing 
a mattress across the top of a 12-foot-high razor-wire fence and then climbing 
over, authorities said Tuesday. 
Clark and Chapman then fled into a nearby dry river bed area, but a deputy 
spotted the two. The area was sealed off, and deputies with dogs closed in. The 
men were found hiding in the river bottom about an hour later. 
Clark is in custody for possession of stolen property, possession of drugs and 
auto theft. Chapman is serving time for convictions related to burglary and 
several outstanding warrants for previous violations.
