LIBERIA FACTION CHIEF THREATENS U.S. MARINES 
Rebel leader Prince Johnson, who holds several foreign hostages, said today 
that he will attack American Marines at the U.S. Embassy if U.S. or other 
foreign troops do not intervene to end Liberia's civil war. 
A group of West African countries meeting in Gambia announced today that they 
will send a joint military task force to Liberia, but they did not say when it 
would be mobilized. 
Some of the 235 Marines airlifted into Monrovia to evacuate Americans and other 
foreign nationals on Sunday took up defensive positions within the walled U.S. 
Embassy compound after Johnson's threat. 
Johnson also presented eight foreign hostages to reporters and said he would 
not free them until a peacekeeping force comes to this West African nation torn 
by a 7-month-old tribal conflict in which 5,000 people have died. 
The hostages shown included one American, identified as Chris Mendes, 27, a 
mining engineer from Sacramento; three Britons; two Germans; a Dutch national, 
and an Argentine. Johnson has pledged not to harm them, but said he would hold 
them until an outside force arrives. 
Johnson, who killed a relief worker Friday who he said was selling rice to 
Monrovia's starving citizens, said he had killed one Liberian congressman for 
spying and would kill another. 
The hostages were abducted Monday night from Hotel Africa, on the northwestern 
outskirts of Monrovia.
