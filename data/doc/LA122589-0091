SAN DIEGO FIRM EARNS MILLIONS FROM KELP TRADE 
While Mendocino County's seaweed farmers wrung $73,000 in sales from the ocean 
in 1989, San Diego-based Kelco was harvesting millions of dollars in giant 
kelp. 
Kelco, a division of pharmaceuticals giant Merck &amp; Co., is the largest 
company of its kind in the world. It has three 140- to 180-foot ships, kelp 
cutters that mow the tops off the fastest-growing and tallest plants in the 
ocean. 
This seaweed, however, isn't harvested to be eaten. It is used in 70 different 
products, including textiles, cosmetics, dental impression compounds and wound 
packings for hospitals. It also makes for longer-lasting foam in beer. 
The biggest application of the algin -- the gelatinous substance extracted from 
kelp -- is in the textile industry's printing paste. The algin thickens the 
paste and provides sharp and well-defined prints. 
It is also used to change flow characteristics in such foods as salad dressing, 
to thicken or make them smoother. 
Kelco does not reveal annual production or sales figures, but one official said 
the largest annual harvest the 60-year-old company ever made was 170,000 tons 
of seaweed in the 1970s off the California coast. 
Its ships trim the surface canopy of giant kelp, usually within a mile of shore 
up and down the coast, from the Mexican border to Monterey, where giant forests 
of the huge plant exist. The kelp forests are leased from the state of 
California. CHARLES HILLINGER
