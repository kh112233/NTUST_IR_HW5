</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This notice announces the acceptance, under Notice 8961, 19891 C.B. 717, of petitions requesting that
cyclododecanol, 1,5,9-cyclododecatriene, and adiponitrile be added to the list of taxable substances in section

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The petitions were received on July 12, 1994 (cyclododecanol and 1,5,9-cyclododecatriene) and July 20, 1994 (adiponitrile).
The petitioner is E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, a manufacturer and exporter of these substances. The following
is a summary of the information contained in the petitions. The complete petitions are available in the Internal Revenue
Service Freedom of Information Reading Room.



Cyclododecanol



HTS number: 2906.19.00

CAS number: 1724396




This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals butadiene and methane. Cyclododecanol is a solid produced predominantly
by air oxidation of cyclododecane. Cyclododecane is produced by hydrogenation of 1,5,9-cyclododecatriene which
is produced by the trimerization of butadiene.

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is:

According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 80.18 percent by weight of the materials used to produce
this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $6.21 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for
butadiene of 1.22 and a conversion factor for methane of 0.08.



1,5,9-cyclododecatriene



HTS number: 2906.19.00

CAS number: 4904614




This substance is derived from the taxable chemical butadiene. 1,5,9-cyclododecatriene is a solid produced predominantly
by trimerization of butadiene in the presence of a coordination-type catalyst.

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is:




3 C

 (1,5,9-cyclododecatriene)




According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 100 percent by weight of the materials used to produce this
substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $5.64 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for butadiene
of 1.16.



Adiponitrile



HTS number: 2926.90.50

CAS number: 111693




This substance is derived from the taxable chemicals methane, ammonia, and butadiene. Adiponitrile is a liquid produced
predominantly by the reaction of butadiene with hydrogen cyanide (derived from ammonia and from methane in natural
gas).

The stoichiometric material consumption formula for this substance is:




2 CH

According to the petition, taxable chemicals constitute 55.55 percent by weight of the materials used to produce
this substance. The rate of tax for this substance would be $5.72 per ton. This is based upon a conversion factor for
methane of 0.52, a conversion factor for ammonia of 0.42, and a conversion factor for butadiene of 0.58.



Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing



Before a determination is made, consideration will be given to any written comments (a signed original and eight (8)
copies) that are submitted timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public
hearing may be scheduled if requested in writing by a person that timely submits written comments. If a public hearing
is scheduled, notice of the date, time, and place for the hearing will be published in the
