FT  14 MAR 94 / The Markets: A nasty splash of Whitewater - Global Investor
The curious American political melodrama known as Whitewater has started to
produce a whitish knuckle or two in the US capital markets.
Nervousness over the implications of the affair for the Clinton presidency
could be a significant feature of the markets this week, together with the
central issue worrying Wall Street, which is the statistics for US inflation
due out tomorrow - the producer price index - and on Wednesday - the
consumer price index.
The Whitewater mess - it is not yet, and may never be worth dignifying with
the word scandal, despite all the baying for blood on Capitol Hill  - has
been building for months, but it was only late last week that it began to
impinge significantly on the consciousness of Wall Street.
The market's initially relaxed attitude was understandable.
The controversy revolves around some arcane investments, made more than a
decade ago, by Mr Clinton and his wife Hillary, in the Whitewater
Development Company, an Arkansas real estate venture, and that company's
ties to a failed Arkansas savings and loans business, Madison Guaranty.
When a group of investigative journalists initially started asking whether
the Clintons had benefited improperly from this web of relationships, the
question seemed of largely historic interest, and not one that impinged too
closely on the credibility of the Clinton administration.
However the issue has been so badly handled by the White House that the
Attorney General has had to appoint an independent special prosecutor to
investigate and over the past two weeks the focus of attention has switched
from the propriety of investments made long ago to whether the White House
has tried to 'cover up' the affair. This in turn has allowed Republicans to
draw a parallel with the Watergate 'cover up' which toppled President Nixon.
On the present evidence, it is preposterous to suggest that a similar fate
could befall Mr Clinton. But several events last week brought home to the
markets the extent to which Whitewater is consuming the President's time and
possibly eating into his political popularity, even though most Americans
seem to regard the affair as an incomprehensible storm in a Washington
teacup.
In quick succession last week the markets saw Whitewater claim a White House
staff member, Mr Bernard Nussbaum, who resigned over his contacts with
federal investigators; saw Mr Clinton besieged at news conferences with
questions about the matter and watched White House aides appear for the
first time before a federal grand jury looking into the matter.
The cumulative effect was to create an impression of a White House under
siege and a climate where wild market rumours could flourish. And they did
last Thursday, when an unsubstantiated report in an obscure Washington
newsletter raised questions about last summer's suicide of Mr Vincent
Foster, a White House aide and Arkansan friend of the Clintons. The bond
market plunged, and equities and the dollar dipped.
Weak dollar
The market hates political uncertainty and is growing concerned lest
Whitewater should weaken Mr Clinton, at least temporarily. Traders ask
whether he might then be tempted to take populist measures to restore his
popularity, such as tough trade sanctions against Japan or spending
programmes which might push up inflation.
Political uncertainty also weakens the dollar, and that inflates the cost of
imported goods. At the same time, a lame duck president would be unable to
take tough foreign policy action on some of the world's trouble spots.
That, together with political violence in South Africa, helps explain a
sharp rise last Thursday in the price of gold, a traditional safe harbour
against political turmoil.
However, last week's market reaction to Whitewater says more about Wall
Street's extreme jitteriness, which is the result of the Federal Reserve's
tightening of monetary policy last month, than it does about the political
risks of Whitewater to equity and bond values.
At present the risks still seem very small, though there is no real way of
knowing what dirt the investigative hounds may throw up. Still, the climate
is such that all sorts of rumours can be set running over the next few
months, allowing market speculators to make some quick killings. Past
investigations by special prosecutors have always been accompanied by a
constant drip of leaks and this one seems unlikely to be different.
Unless Whitewater turns into a genuine scandal, the biggest effect of the
affair could be to weaken the political clout of the unelected Mrs Clinton,
who is overseeing that central piece of the White House legislative agenda,
its heath care reform package.
Even before Whitewater, Congress had been expected to approve a far less
ambitious reform package than Mrs Clinton was seeking and this prospect has
been greatly reinforced by the events of the past two weeks.
That may be good for stocks in the health care sector, which have been
hammered by expectations of government price restrictions. In the short run,
a restricted health package might also give a little fillip to economic
expansion, ameliorating companies' fears that hiring workers would burden
them with a big rise in healthcare costs.
Inflation
Politics apart, Wall Street's central focus this week will be on the US
inflation figures for February, which are expected to show producer prices
rising at a rate of about 0.3 per cent, up from 0.2 per cent in January, and
consumer prices up by a similar amount, compared to no change in January.
Figures like this are hardly a sign of rampant inflation but the market is
currently so bearish that it tends to discount almost all good news and
pounce with relish on figures that are worse than expected. So getting
through this run of statistics without a further bond market dip may not be
easy.
The futures market is already suggesting the yield on the benchmark 30-year
issue may top 7 per cent before the bear run is over, and as Mr John Lipsky
of Salomon Brothers points out: 'The structure of forward rates now
anticipates much higher short rates and significant yield curve flattening.'
This stems in large measure from market expectations that the Federal
Reserve is likely to tighten monetary policy again in the next few weeks,
possibly on March 22, when its policy-making Open Market Committee next
meets.
The sharp and unexpected drop in global bond markets which accompanied
February's tightening may make the Fed cautious about further tightening
until the market calms down, yet it is unlikely to do so while the world
waits for the Fed to move.
The bull case
US economists are deeply divided over the need for the Fed's February
tightening, its first in five years. Most argue that it was a timely, even
overdue, response to the threat of inflation, which was already evident in
the sharply rising price of financial assets. Yet some argue that Mr Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is fighting an inflationary demon which does
not exist.
One of the most bullish of this school is Mr Edward Yardeni, chief economist
at CJ Lawrence, the brokers, who reckons that US inflation will run at only
2 per cent this year - the consensus is about 3 per cent. His central
argument is that this is not a typical recovery because of new, powerfully
disinflationary factors around the globe.
For one thing, the end of the Cold War has opened up huge pools of cheap
labour in the Eastern bloc, putting downward pressure on Western wage rates.
For another, the US is in the early stages of an information technology
revolution, demonstrated by a huge jump recently in its spending on
high-tech capital equipment. This should feed through into a big increase in
productivity, again ameliorating inflationary tendencies.
Mr Yardeni reckons that the Fed Funds rate will end 1994 where it is now, at
3 1/4 , and that the yield on long bonds could fall to the 5 per cent range
in 1995, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 5000. Hence his
current slogan: '5/5 in 95.'
It is certainly not a mainstream view, but at the least it is a useful
reminder, amid the gloom of the current market correction, that the economic
outlook in the US remains bright, that the bull market in stocks may have
some way yet to run, and that next year could see Europe emerging from
recession.
