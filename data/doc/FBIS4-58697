  [Text] Cairo, 5 May (MENA)--The scheduled Arab League 
mission to Yemen to try to end the political crisis and prevent 
a destructive civil war has been postponed. 
  A responsible source at the Arab League said that Arab 
League 
Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid asked Major General 
Sa'id Bayraqdar, assistant secretary general for military 
affairs, and Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Sakit, the Arab League's 
expert on Arab affairs, to travel to Yemen today. But the 
delegation could not leave Cairo International Airport after 
officials said that the plane to Sanaa would not depart today 
following the closure of Sanaa Airport because of the 
deteriorating security situation.
