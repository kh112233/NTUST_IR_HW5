SEARCH CONTINUES FOR 6 REMAINING JAIL ESCAPEES 
About 200 police using helicopters and dogs searched Saturday for six inmates 
who fled a jail by sawing through the bars on a window and shimmying over a 
razor-sharp fence. 
The inmates escaped in a group of 13 Friday night from the Norfolk County House 
of Correction. Two were quickly captured, and five others were caught Saturday. 
Overcrowding and racial tensions have fueled several outbreaks at the prison 
recently, officials said.
