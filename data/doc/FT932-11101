FT  06 MAY 93 / Mandela in S Africa aid status call
THE ECONOMIC rebuilding of a post-apartheid South Africa would be hampered
unless multilateral organisations acknowledge wealth disparities and
reclassify it as a developing country, Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president,
warned last night, Our Foreign Staff writes.
In a speech for delivery at Westminster to MPs and peers, he said the
classification as a middle-income country was a 'false perception', ignoring
the fact that 'the majority of our population, which happens to be black,
lives in conditions of dire poverty'. Mr Mandela, who will be in Geneva
today, said eligibility for aid from such bodies as the UN Development
Programme was being put at risk because 'so rich are the few that are rich
that it becomes impossible to see that the poor exist at all'.
Earlier he met Mr John Major, UK prime minister, to outline difficulties in
the transition to democracy.
