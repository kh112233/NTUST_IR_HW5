FT  20 JUL 92 / Wellcome expects good news on Aids drug tests
THE FINAL phase of Wellcome's international share offer is expected to
coincide with positive news for the company's anti-Aids drugs.
The results of clinical trials involving the company's AZT drug Retrovir,
which still has a virtual monopoly of the Aids drug market five years after
its launch, will be given later this week at a world conference on Aids,
taking place in Amsterdam.
Hopes are high that a study to be released by Prof David Cooper of the
University of New South Wales, Australia, will provide new evidence that AZT
helps delay the onset of Aids symptoms in people infected with HIV, the
virus that causes the disease. Wellcome needs such evidence to expand AZT
sales.
Another study is expected to show that a combination of Wellcome's two
best-selling drugs - AZT and Acyclovir, which is normally used to treat
herpes infections - can prolong the life of people with advanced HIV
infection.
Other conference sessions will show that the level of medical concern about
AZT's side-effects is declining. Although the drug is still controversial,
it is becoming established as a reliable Aids treatment.
Few of the exciting leads on Aids treatment discussed at previous world Aids
conferences have come to anything. The handful of promising new treatments
mainly give their best results in combination with the Wellcome drug.
