FT  01 DEC 92 / Arrest over Molln arson
German authorities yesterday announced the arrest of a 19-year-old youth on
suspicion of causing the arson attack which killed three Turks in the
northern town of Molln last week, writes Judy Dempsey in Bonn.
A woman and two girls died after a fire bomb was thrown into their home, an
incident which prompted the authorities to take a much tougher stance
against the rise of the far-right. A 25-year-old man, Mr Michael Peters, was
arrested last week on suspicion of leading a right-wing terrorist movement.
Mr Alexander von Stahl, the federal public prosecutor, said yesterday he was
also investigating the activities of four other right-wing groups.
