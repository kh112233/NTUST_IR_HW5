  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 27 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
has categogically denied that there is any link between a 
hydroelectric project and the building of a special forces 
complex under the Malaysia-United Kingdom memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) on the purchase of defence equipment. 
  Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak Said: I deny categorically 
the connection between the Pergau Dam (in the northeastern 
Kelantan State) and the MOU which is a programme for the 
modernisation of the Malaysian Armed Forces. 
  The establishment of the special forces complex in Mersing 
Town in the southern Johor State was one of the armed forces' 
development projects, the masterplan of which had been 
completed, he told reporters at a press conference here 
Wednesday. 
  Najib said the construction of the multimillion camp 
complex, 
basically for special forces troops, would be implemented under 
the Seventh Malaysia Plan (1996-2000) as the financial ceiling 
for the project had been exceeded. 
  He said British special forces personnel might be involved 
in 
the construction phase of the complex. 
  The master plan for the Mersing project was drawn up by 
British construction company John Laing International. 
  Najib said some foreign military personnel might be trained 
at the Mersing special forces camp but there would be no 
permanent basing of large foreign troops there. [passage omitted]
