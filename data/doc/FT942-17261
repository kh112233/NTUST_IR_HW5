FT  06 APR 94 / Private cash targeted in energy plan
The government hopes that its subsidy programme for renewable energy will
attract Pounds 3bn of private investment into 'green' power sources by the
end of the decade.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said yesterday that subsidies, budgeted at
just under Pounds 20m this year, will be concentrated on key technologies
which are environmentally acceptable and have good prospects of commercial
exploitation. He mentioned solar power, wind power, fuel cells and energy
from coppice (managed woodlands) and waste. But he said that other sources
would cease to be subsidised when current commitments expire because of
their limited commercial potential. These are tidal power, wave power and
geothermal research.
The renewable energy sources must contribute to diverse, secure and
sustainable energy supplies, to reductions in the emission of pollutants and
the encouragement of internationally competitive industries.
Mr Eggar's statement on renewable energy strategy, which reaffirmed the
government's goal of creating 1,500MW of renewable energy capacity by the
year 2000, came in response to the 1992 report of the Renewable Energy
Advisory Group which assessed Britain's capacity to produce electricity from
'green' sources.
Mr Eggar said the main vehicle for promoting renewable energy was the
non-fossil-fuel (NFFO) programme which subsidises electricity companies for
buying electricity generated by fuels other than oil, gas and coal. The
government is considering bids from renewable energy projects for the next
round of NFFO contracts.
Mr Eggar stressed, however, that the purpose of the NFFO was to draw in
private funds, which he expected to total Pounds 3bn by 2000.
