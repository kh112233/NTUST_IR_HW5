WOUNDED WOMAN ARRESTED IN HUSBAND'S SLAYING IS FREED 
A Simi Valley woman suspected in the shooting death of her husband was released 
Wednesday because investigators said they were unsure how the man was killed. 
Christopher Fortunato, 29, was found shot to death in the couple's home in the 
1100 block of Hudson Court at 6 a.m. Tuesday. 
Officers were called to the home by a neighbor after the victim's wife, Kari 
Fortunato, 31, ran to the neighbor's home and asked them to call for help, 
police said. 
Sgt. Tony Harper said Kari Fortunato, who was covered with blood, was taken to 
Simi Valley Adventist Hospital, where she was arrested on suspicion of slaying 
her husband. At the hospital, it was determined that she had gunshot wounds in 
both hands and on the top of her head. 
She was reported in stable condition at the hospital Wednesday. 
Police said the couple were arguing inside their house before the shooting. 
Christopher Fortunato was found in a hallway, shot in the head. A handgun 
believed to have been used in the shooting was found in the home. 
After the shooting, Kari Fortunato declined on the advice of an attorney to 
talk with investigators about what had happened, police said. 
Because of her wounds, the lack of witnesses and other information about the 
shooting, detectives on Wednesday decided not to seek a murder charge against 
Kari Fortunato, Harper said. He declined to speculate whether Christopher 
Fortunato could have been shot by his wife or if she may have been injured 
while trying to prevent his suicide. 
"We have not yet determined what happened," Harper said. "We don't know whether 
we have a homicide or suicide. We still have more work to do on this."
