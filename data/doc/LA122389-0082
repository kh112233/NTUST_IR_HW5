METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEVER READ BUCHWALD STORY, MURPHY SAYS 
Comedian Eddie Murphy, in a sworn deposition released Friday, said he never 
read a story sold to Paramount Pictures by humorist Art Buchwald, but was 
familiar with the idea and liked it. 
Even so, Murphy says in the deposition that he and talk-show host Arsenio Hall 
wrote the concept for the hit movie "Coming to America," countering Buchwald's 
claims that the movie was based on his story treatment, "King for a Day." 
"Coming to America" is about an African prince, played by Murphy, who comes to 
New York to find a bride. Buchwald's story concept focused on a contemptuous 
king from an oil-rich African nation who is stranded in Washington when he is 
overthrown. 
A Los Angeles Superior Court trial in the $5-million breach-of-contract case 
began last week, focusing on Buchwald's allegation that Paramount stole his 
idea to make "Coming to America," which was the third-biggest hit of 1988, 
grossing $300 million. Murphy has said he will not testify in the case. His 
deposition was taken Oct. 12 by Buchwald's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell.
