FT  22 MAY 92 / Freight may use fast Channel link
MR JOHN MacGREGOR, trans-port secretary, yesterday raised the possibility of
head-on competition between railway companies for freight traffic through
the Channel tunnel.
Mr MacGregor announced in a written Commons answer that the planned Pounds
4bn high-speed link between London and the tunnel would be designed to carry
freight as well as passenger trains.
It had been expected that the link would carry only high-speed passenger
trains while all tunnel freight traffic used BR's existing tracks to the
Kent coast.
The effect of yesterday's announcement is that operators of freight trains
will have a choice between two routes to the tunnel: the existing lines
owned by BR (or a privatised version of it) and the new line which the
government has said will be built and owned by an independent private
developer.
The transport department said yesterday that it was not strictly necessary
for the high-speed link to carry freight trains because there was enough
capacity on the existing network for all anticipated freight traffic.
This meant that two freight tracks would not be added to the two passenger
tracks because the extra Pounds 2bn cost could not be justified.
But the department could not rule out the possibility that demand might be
greater than forecast, for example, if a second Channel tunnel were built.
It has therefore decided on the relatively low-cost option of incorporating
passing loops into the railway so that high-speed passenger trains can
overtake slower freight trains.
It is not yet clear, however, whether a private-sector developer will be
found to build the line or when it will open.
