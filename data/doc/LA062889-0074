ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FULLERTON; 
WOMAN STRUCK BY TRAIN, BUT INJURIES ARE MINOR 
A woman suffered minor injuries today when she was struck by a train as it 
approached the Fullerton Amtrak station. 
Guadalupe Magdalena, 21, was apparently walking near the railroad track 
bordering Orangethorpe Avenue about a mile from the station when the 7:30 a.m. 
northbound train struck her, Fullerton Police Lt. Al Burks said. 
Engineers told police that the train was traveling about 40 m.p.h. when the 
woman was spotted walking north on a pedestrian walkway. The train's horn was 
sounded, and the woman tried to move aside when the train hit her, Burks said. 
The train "clipped her on the left shoulder," Burks said. 
Magdalena could not remember how she was struck, he said. 
She was taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital's emergency room, where she was 
treated for multiple scrapes and bruises, a hospital representative said. 
The accident is under investigation.
