FT  18 MAR 92 / Tightening the noose: The offensives by Burma's military
government against ethnic minorities
On Burma's western border, Moslem refugees fleeing persecution are streaming
into Bangladesh at the rate of 5,000 a day. On the eastern border, Thai
forces are on alert and another refugee exodus is feared. In Rangoon, the
capital, one of the world's most authoritarian regimes is relentlessly
tightening its hold on power.
Mrs Khaleda Zia, prime minister of Bangladesh, is this week visiting the US
to ask President George Bush and the United Nations Security Council to
intervene in the refugee crisis.
At least 200,000 Moslems, known as Rohingyas, from Burma's western Arakan
state, are living in makeshift camps in Bangladesh. They have fled the
Burmese army which, according to their detailed and consistent accounts, has
unleashed a terrifying campaign of rape, torture, killing and forced
evictions to make them leave.
Close to the border with Thailand, Burmese forces are engaged in another
fierce offensive against ethnic minorities, as Karen rebels, who have been
joined by other opposition groups, grimly defend their base at Manerplaw.
Thai fighter pilots have been ordered to attack Burmese aircraft which enter
Thailand's air space in pursuit of the rebels, and at the weekend Thai
artillery opened fire on Burmese troops which had crossed the border to
attack the Karen base from the rear.
The attacks on ethnic minorities are part of a drive by Burma's ruling State
Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) to establish its grip on all walks
of life. The military junta took power in 1988 as pro-democracy
demonstrations were sweeping the country. It held elections in 1990, but has
ignored their result. It has kept the 1991 Nobel peace prize winner, Aung
San Suu Kyi - leader of the opposition party which won a landslide victory
in the poll - under house arrest since July 1989.
To try to squash numerous ethnic rebellions on the borders, the military is
undergoing a rapid expansion. When the Slorc came to power in 1988 the
military was about 180,000-strong. Now it is believed to have more than
250,000 men and that the number will double to some 500,000 by the end of
the century.
The intention, Burma-watchers say, is to enmesh the army so deeply in the
bureaucracy and state institutions that it can never be removed, even if it
does one day allow civilians some measure of participation in the political
process.
Burmese people offer little comment on what the government is doing against
the Moslems and Karens. For them the campaigns are just another example of
the extremes to which the army is prepared to go to establish total control
over the whole of the country.
The military government in Rangoon denies allegations of ill-treatment of
Moslems and, through the tightly controlled media, accuses foreign news
organisations of attacking the country with 'fabricated reports'. It says
the Rohingyas are not one of Burma's native ethnic groups, and that the
refugees are illegal immigrants or ignorant locals who have been lured away
by Rohingya 'terrorists'.
Foreign residents in Rangoon say that a big immigration check has been under
way in Arakan state and that the military has been expanding its barracks
and roads in the area. They say the government has been concerned that
members of the Karen ethnic group, which is fighting for its own homeland in
south-eastern Burma, have been trying to infiltrate western parts of the
country. They fear the possibility of the Karens giving support to
separatists there.
On the streets of Burma's slowly decaying cities, few soldiers are visible -
an indication, says a foreigner in Rangoon, 'of just how confident they (the
military) are'. There are, however, said to be soldiers hidden in many
buildings and stationed on the outskirts of the bigger cities, where they
can be quickly called on if needed. There are thousands of military
informers scattered throughout the population and even the most innocent of
conversations is reported. 'The government controls everything,' says the
young driver of a pedal taxi.
Nearly two years after the election, the Slorc shows no intention of giving
up power. 'Political activity is on hold,' says one diplomat. 'They've got
the place very, very tightly sewn up.'
Of more than 200 political parties which registered for the May 1990
election, just 32 remain. All are monitored by the authorities; none is
allowed to organise, or even discuss, anti-government activity. Universities
are closed and university teachers have been sent on political re-education
courses. Many former pro-democracy politicians and student activists have
fled the country, and many others are in prison.
Amnesty International has identified 1,500 political prisoners by name, and
the US State Department has estimated the full number to be about 2,000.
Reports of torture and ill-treatment are common.
The government, aware that it is not popular at home, sometimes explains
through the newspapers or giant red billboards in the streets that life will
get easier as stability returns. The army 'will never betray the national
cause', one such board reads.
It is also aware that it is vulnerable to growing economic discontent, and
is seeking to do something about the chaotic economy. Sources in Rangoon say
it has drawn up a four-year economic plan. The main aims are to revive
exports, increase agricultural productivity and boost efficiency of state
enterprises. Shortages of inputs such as fertiliser and electricity will
make that difficult.
The Slorc is believed to want to encourage joint ventures with foreign
companies. However, Burma's poor international standing and the publicity
attracted by persecution of ethnic minorities may make this increasingly
difficult.
The Slorc ended 26 years of the 'Burmese road to socialism' when it took
power, and announced that there would be an open economy. A foreign
investment law was passed, prompting a flurry of activity. Thai companies
are involved in logging Burma's forests; Singapore, Japan and South Korea
have significant involvement in the country; PepsiCo of the US set up a
bottling plant, while Amoco and Unocal of the US, BHP of Australia, Japan's
Idemitsu and Shell are among 10 foreign oil companies which signed contracts
to work in Burma. However, repatriation of profits requires cabinet
approval, bureaucracy is a nightmare and corruption is endemic.
Foreign trade has increased substantially, though much of what is available
on the streets is the result of rampant smuggling. Not long ago it was
impossible to buy a light bulb or a tube of toothpaste, but today shops are
full of Chinese, Japanese and western-made goods. Almost anything can be
bought at Rangoon's night markets, and foreign films are popular.
Some Burmese have done well out of the new economic openness. 'They are very
rich but we don't know where they get it from,' says a young restaurant
worker who, like most people, is struggling to make a living. Inflation is
high - rice prices rose by more than 60 per cent last year - and there is a
shortage of petrol at the government pumps while on the black market the
price per gallon is six times higher. As a result, transport is scarce.
Economic sanctions by foreign countries, say Burmese dissidents living in
exile, may be the only way to bring the Slorc down. But though the US and
European countries have taken measures to isolate Burma, a full-scale
embargo seems a long way away. Telling pressure could be exerted by
south-east Asian neighbours. Most have made individual protests, but they
have refused to take a united stand. In the absence of strong external
pressure and with domestic opposition kept in check, the Slorc seems set to
continue its repression.
