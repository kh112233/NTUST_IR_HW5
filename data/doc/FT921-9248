FT  13 FEB 92 / Letter: A gratuitous comparison
Sir, British Rail managers have to have thick skins but should they really
have to put up with being likened by Mr Jonathan Price to a group of
Communist party officials running an east German Kombinat (Letters, February
10)?
Perhaps Mr Price would like to say how many such groups have consistently
reduced operating costs over recent years; halved their dependence on
government grant; turned round a major component of their business from
substantial loss to significant profit; and stand comparison with the best
in Europe on productivity and cost-effectiveness in spite of enjoying a far
lower share of national resources?
Does he have any idea of the fundamental changes taking place in BR in
organisation, in restructuring working arrangements, in programmes for
quality, safety and culture change?
It is ironic that your paper's same edition mentions a project to build the
Waterloo International Terminal which is on time, on budget and on its way
to providing a thoroughly modern, fitting gateway for the coming Channel
tunnel services. Where is the eastern European parallel for that?
There is much to be done to improve railway services in Britain and
management undoubtedly has its part to play.
But the debate and performance of the railways will be helped by
constructive, informed comment rather than by gratuitous abuse.
