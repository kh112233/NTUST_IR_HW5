  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 10, BNS - Estonia received about 1.1 
billion kroons in foreign aid and signed 109 million U.S. 
dollars (about 1.5 billion kroons) worth of loan agreements with 
other countries, former Finance Minister Madis Uurike said in a 
press conference today. 
  Uurike said the country's government used 63 million dollars 
of total 109 million dollars received in loans. The rest was 
provided to the banking sector and regional governments, who 
have accepted the obligation to repay the loans. 
  The energy, transport, environment and banking sectors were 
the main areas of the economy to receive additional funding from 
the loans. Many of those applying for the loan money, however, 
were unable to get a share in the funds, as the total investment 
capacity fell about 23 billion kroons short of the amount sought 
by the loan applicants. 
  But the former finance minister also pointed out positive 
changes in the usage of the loan and foreign aid money. He said 
investments and cooperation projects have replaced fuel, 
medicines and cars purchases as the main destination of the loan 
money.
