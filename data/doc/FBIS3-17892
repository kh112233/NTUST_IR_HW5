  [Text] An announcement by General Pavel Grachev, Russian 
defense minister, that a special defense region will be created 
in Kaliningrad Oblast has provoked a wave of insinuations. This 
purely military issue, which is solely a matter of strengthening 
Russia's national security, is being whipped up by the European 
media. 
  In this connection, Yuriy Matochkin, head of administration 
in Kaliningrad Oblast, said the military in the amber region, 
together with their families, amounted to 10 percent of the 
population. After the defense region has been set up, the 
grouping of troops will number 26,000 people. This is 
considerably lower than allowed by the treaty on conventional 
arms in Europe.
