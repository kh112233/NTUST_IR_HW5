PEMEX TO BOOST OUTPUT OF UNLEADED GAS 
Pemex, the Mexican government petroleum monopoly, has agreed to increase its 
production of unleaded gasoline as part of a pollution-fighting agreement with 
the Mexican auto industry and the government, the official news agency Notimex 
said. 
Most of the unleaded gas that Pemex produces is exported to the United States. 
Pemex also said it will reduce the contaminants emitted by all of its 
refineries and other facilities.
