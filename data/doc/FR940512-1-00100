(c) 

Elimination of lead-based paint hazards. 

The purpose of this paragraph is to implement the provisions of section 302 of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention
Act, 42 U.S.C. 4822, by establishing as far as practicable the hazards due to the presence of paint that might contain
lead and to which children less than six years of age may be exposed in projects assisted under this part. The Secretary
has promulgated requirements at part 35, subpart C of this title, regarding the elimination of lead-based paint hazards
in HUD-associated housing. 
(1) 

Definitions_Chewable surface 

means any intact protruding painted surface up to five feet from the floor or ground that is readily accessible to children
less than six years of age (e.g., protruding corners, windowsills and frames, doors and frames, and other protruding
woodwork). 


Defective paint surface 

means a surface on which the paint is nonintact, i.e., the paint is cracking, scaling, chipping, peeling, or loose.



Elevated blood lead level or EBL. 

Excessive absorption of lead is a confirmed concentration of lead in whole blood of 20 &mu;g/dl (micrograms per deciliter
of whole blood) for single test or 1519 &mu;g/dl in two consecutive tests several months apart. 


Lead-based paint surface 

means a paint surface, whether or not defective, that is identified as having a lead content of greater than or equal
to 


1 mg/cm2 or 0.5 percent by weight or 5000 parts per million. 


(2) 

Inspection and testing

_(i) 

Defective paint surfaces. 

The grantee or State recipient shall inspect for defective paint surfaces in all units constructed before 1978 that
are occupied by families with children less than six years of age and that are proposed for rehabilitation assistance.
Defective paint surfaces either must be tested for lead content or, if defective paint surfaces are not tested, the
presence of lead-based paint shall be assumed and the surfaces shall be abated. 
(ii) 

Chewable surfaces. 

The grantee or State recipient shall be required to test the lead content of chewable surfaces if a child less than six
years of age with an identified EBL condition is part of the family residing in a unit that was constructed before 1978
and receives rehabilitation assistance. Lead content shall be tested by using a portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF)
analyzer or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. 
(iii) 

Abatement without testing. 

In lieu of the procedures set forth in 511.15(c)(2)(ii), in the case of a residential structure constructed
before 1978, the grantee or State recipient may forego testing and abate all chewable surfaces in accordance with
the methods set out in 35.24(b)(4) of this title. 
(3) 

Abatement actions. 

(i) When surfaces inspected under 511.15(c)(2)(i) are found to contain lead-based paint and when defective
paint surfaces are found but not tested for lead content, all such surfaces shall be abated. If defective paint surfaces
are tested for lead content, surfaces found to equal or exceed 1.0 milligrams of lead per square centimeter or 0.5 percent
by weight or 5000 parts per million (ppm), shall be abated. A qualified inspector or laboratory shall certify in writing
the precise results of the testing. Abatement shall be performed before final inspection and approval of the work.



* * * * * 


(4) 

Abatement methods. 

At a minimum, treatment of the defective area and chewable lead-based paint surfaces shall consist of covering or
removal of the painted surface as described in 35.24(b)(4) of this title.

(c) * * * This paragraph (c) is promulgated pursuant to the authorization granted in 35.24(b)(6) of this title
and supersedes, with respect to all housing to which it applies, the requirements prescribed by part 35, subpart C

Applicability. 

This paragraph (c)(1) applies to the rehabilitation of all painted surfaces in existing housing that is assisted
under this part.*** 


* * * * * 


(vi) Other similar types of single-purpose programs that do not include physical repairs or remodeling of any painted
surfaces of residential structures; and 
(vii) Any non-single purpose rehabilitation that does not 
involve any painted surface and does not exceed $3000 per unit.

Inspection and testing. 

(i) The grantee shall inspect for defective paint surfaces in all units constructed before 1978 that are occupied
