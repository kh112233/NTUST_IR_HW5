  [Text] Chemistry is full of excitement. There is frenzy, 
explosion, turmoil -- but also there are microscopic phenomena, 
to which Christian Amatore has devoted his time. This "research 
maniac," director of the Molecular Activation Processes 
Laboratory (CNRS) [National Scientific Research Center] at the 
Ecole Normale Superieure, has developed ultra-microelectrodes, a 
kind of "microscope to watch molecules reacting." This tool is 
revolutionary, both for guiding the synthesis of new materials 
and for observing the exchange of neurotransmitters in the 
brain, and has won its inventor the CNRS silver medal. 
  His work has opened up a new field of applications. Air 
Liquide and CGE [General Electricity Company] are both 
exploiting the process, the former to develop biomimetic systems 
for separating and concentrating oxygen in the air, the latter 
to design materials for optoelectronics. 
  Biologists in particular, notably American Mark Wightman 
(University of South Carolina), are interested in this 
"ultra-fine activity scanner" enabling the molecules of 
neurotransmitters emitted at synapse level to be counted, or the 
effect of drugs on a rat's brain to be measured. Investigations 
are only just starting.
