  [Text] Athens (DPA) -- According to Greek customs, on 
Friday morning [22 April] a young German couple tried to smuggle 
121 kg of heroin across the Turkish-Greek border. The 
drug-sniffing dogs got extremely nervous when the couple's 
camper approached the customs station. Therefore, the customs 
officials disassembled the vehicle. The two Germans have 
already made a confession. 
  According to what they said, they entered Turkey via Izmir 
at 
the beginning of April to meet a Turk they knew, who had worked 
in Germany for a long time. The drugs were destined for a 
client in London. The couple was in financial difficulties, 
which they wanted to remedy by smuggling drugs.
