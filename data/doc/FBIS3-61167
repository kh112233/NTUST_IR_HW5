  [Text] 
  The bill of the 1994 State Budget Law should come up 
for its third reading at today's session of Riigikogu [Estonia's 
parliament], and is likely to be passed, according to Heido 
Vitsur, deputy chairman of the budget committee. 
  The total amount of the budget is roughly 5.8 billion 
kroons. 
Of the proceeds projected, 2.26 billion kroons are due from 
sales tax, and 2.1 billion kroons from income tax. Major 
allocations out of the state budget for the coming year are 1.16 
billion to the Ministry of Culture and Education, 994.4 million 
to the Social Services Ministry, 600.7 million to the Ministry 
of Transportation and Communications, and 558 million kroons to 
the Ministry of the Interior. The Credit Fund for Agriculture 
and Rural Development is allocated 81 million kroons in the 
budget bill. 
  Before the third reading of the budget bill, Vitsur said, 
the 
budget committee approved the proposed amendments increasing the 
allocation for salaries of cultural employees by 6 million 
kroons, and the allocation to finance educational employment by 
30 million kroons. Previously, these amounts had come out of 
local budgets. No decision was made on the total of additional 
social security funding for child support, but the amount for 
this is expected to range between 50 and 100 million kroons. In 
the future, the state budget will also have to cover social 
security payments to compensate for health damages. 
  Vitsur said that the budget bill is based on the new Income 
Tax Law, resulting in an increase in proceeds, compared to 
earlier estimates. Most of the increase in proceeds, however, is 
due to the overall increase in the volume of business. The new 
Income Tax Law also reduced the sponsorship deductions for 
enterprises. The previously allowed partial tax exemption to 
encourage investment was replaced by accelerated depreciation.
