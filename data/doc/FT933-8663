FT  14 AUG 93 / Part-time council staff get pensions
LOCAL government employees working less than 15 hours a week are entitled to
be included in the Local Government Pension Scheme, the largest in the
country, under new regulations published yesterday by the Department of the
Environment.
This follows a campaign by the GMB general union which has argued that the
overwhelming majority of part-time workers are women and that their
exclusion from the scheme was discriminatory. The department said the issue
had been brought to its attention and it had decided that the cut-off was
discriminatory.
