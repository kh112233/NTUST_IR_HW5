<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On March 9, 1994, EPA issued a notice announcing the availability of its draft lead hazard information pamphlet, entitled


Lead-Based Paint: Protect Your Children

, for public review and comment. The pamphlet, required under section 406(a) of the Residential Lead-Based Paint
Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, will be distributed to owners and occupants of pre-1978 housing before the commencement
of renovations by paid renovators, and will be distributed to purchasers and lessees of pre-1978 housing before sale
or lease. The comment period for the pamphlet closed on May 9, 1994. Based on the comments received, and on information
obtained during focus group tests in several cities, EPA has revised the pamphlet. In the spirit of maximizing responsiveness
to the general public and regulated community, EPA is scheduling a public meeting to augment the publics' opportunity
to provide input on the pamphlet. Because of the time constraints imposed by the statutory deadline, however, no additional
comment period will be allowed beyond the public meeting date.

II. Background


Under the Congressional mandate in section 406(a) of TSCA, EPA has developed a lead hazard information pamphlet,
for use in association with several regulations mandated by the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act
[Pub. L. 105550]. As required by the statute, EPA is developing the pamphlet in consultation with the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
Section 406(a) of TSCA also requires that EPA issue the pamphlet for notice and comment. EPA issued a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11119), announcing the draft pamphlet's availability for public comment. EPA made the draft
pamphlet available through the National Lead Information Clearinghouse, as well as the TSCA Docket. During the 60day
public comment period, 69 parties submitted comments. EPA also conducted a series of focus group tests in five different
cities, Atlanta, GA, Birmingham, AL, Chicago, IL, Hayward, CA, and Washington, DC. EPA has used these focus tests
to solicit general feedback on the presentation of the material from individuals with a high school education or lower.
The results of the focus tests, combined with the technical and stylistic comments provided by the public commenters,
will help EPA develop a final pamphlet that meets the informational needs of a broad range of readers. 


III. Role of Pamphlet


This pamphlet will be disseminated as a result of several Congressional directives that will be implemented in separate
rulemaking initiatives. Section 406(b) of TSCA requires that EPA promulgate regulations requiring each person
who performs for compensation a renovation of target housing to provide a lead hazard information pamphlet to the
owner(s) and occupant(s) of such housing prior to commencing the renovation. In addition, this pamphlet may be used
by other Federal Programs to support their educational and outreach goals and obligations. EPA issued proposed regulations
under section 406(b) on March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11108), for a 60day public comment period that closed on May 9, 1994.
EPA is currently reviewing public comments and preparing the final rulemaking. 
Section 1012 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act (also known as ``Title X'') requires that the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provide the pamphlet to purchasers and tenants of housing receiving
Federal assistance. These regulations are under development by HUD. Section 1018 of Title X requires that EPA and
HUD promulgate regulations requiring sellers or lessors of target housing to provide purchasers and lessees with
the lead hazard information pamphlet. EPA and HUD expect to issue the proposed regulations for this rulemaking in
late summer or early fall of 1994. Commenters should be aware, however, that comments received on the pamphlet during
the comment period for the proposed section 1018 regulation will not be used in developing the final draft of the pamphlet,
due by October 28, 1994. Where appropriate, EPA may consider those comments when developing subsequent revisions
to the pamphlet, as authorized by section 406 of TSCA.
