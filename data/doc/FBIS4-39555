  [Text] RIGA, Jun 08, BNS - The Latvian Cabinet confirmed 
Tuesday an agreement on cooperation among the Baltic states' 
governments and parliaments. The agreement provides for 
formation of the Baltic Council, Latvian Justice Minister Egils 
Levits said at a press conference. 
  The formation of the Baltic Council means that there will be 
institutional cooperation among the Baltic prime ministers, 
ministers and parliaments as to coordinating their policies in 
legislation, economy, foreign trade, culture, transport and 
communication, said Levits. 
  The Baltic Council will consist of the Baltic Assembly, 
which 
was founded in 1991, and the Baltic Ministers Council. The 
Baltic council's resolutions will refer to all the Baltic states. 
  Levits considers that formation of the new institution will 
promote cooperation among Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. 
  The agreement on formation of the Baltic Council will be 
signed on June 13 in Tallin, during the meeting of the Baltic 
ministers. 
  The Baltic Council will be formed after the model of the 
Nordic States' Council.
