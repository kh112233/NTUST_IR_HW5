OTHER COMMENTARY; 
A SENTENCE TO BACK BENCHES 
While I understand the public's frustration with the system, term limits are 
not the proper cure. There are more appropriate means of ensuring turnover and 
restoring faith in the process. 
One is meaningful campaign-finance reform, including reducing rates for 
political advertising and challenging the U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 ruling 
equating campaign spending with free speech. Last year, I proposed spending 
limits on California races to challenge the court decision, and I'll push the 
legislation again this time. 
The most needed change is true grass-roots politics. I was told by all the 
"experts" not to challenge an incumbent two years ago. Incumbents can be 
defeated (four Assembly members lost last week), but challengers need spirited 
grass-roots campaigns. 
Why hard work instead of term limits? Because some incumbents should be booted 
out, but the good ones should stay awhile. As a freshman legislator, I turned 
to experienced colleagues for advice on complex policy issues. Who will all the 
freshmen in 1997 turn to after Proposition 140 takes effect? Lobbyists 
representing special interests, rather than a colleague who represents the 
public interest and who has built up expertise in key issue areas.
