FT  16 APR 94 / EBRD puts emphasis on business
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will focus its
attention more sharply on financing east and central Europe's private banks
and budding entrepreneurs if bank governors and shareholders in Europe and
North America approve the bank's new strategic plan at the annual meeting
here.
The revised strategy for the slimmed-down bank, now headed by Mr Jacques de
Larosiere, former managing director of the IMF, was drawn up after the
resignation of Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's first president. This followed
a stormy annual meeting in London last year and attacks on over-spending,
excessive bureaucracy and neglect of the needs of fledgling entrepreneurs.
The new focus has already upgraded the merchant banking aspect of the bank's
activities, headed by Mr Ron Freeman, a former US investment banker, at the
expense of the development banking side. The EBRD was always intended to
focus at least 60 per cent of its spending on private projects, not to
replicate traditional infrastructure projects financed by the World Bank and
EIB.
The bank's potentially strategic role in financing the reconstruction or
clos-ure of eastern Europe's dangerous Soviet-designed nuclear power
stations has also been frustrated by legal delays.
