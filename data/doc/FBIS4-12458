  [Text] As part of the Israeli occupation authorities' 
piracy off the Lebanese coast, this morning an Israeli gunboat 
intercepted a German-flagged ship carrying used cars to Tyre 
port. The Israeli pirates searched the ship before allowing it 
to enter the port. 
  Another Israeli gunboat carried out naval patrols all along 
the coast from al-Naqurah to Tyre.
