  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- Japanese tourist 
arrivals are soaring this year, the Korea National Tourism Corp. 
(KNTC) said Monday. 
  In the first quarter 387,000 Japanese visited South Korea, a 
38-percent increase over the same period last year. 
  The number of Japanese tourists stood at 100,000 in January, 
up 25 percent, at 120,000 in February, up 32 percent, and at 
167,000 in march, up 53 percent. 
  Japanese tourist arrivals are expected to climb further in 
the future, especially during the golden holidays of April 
27-May 7 when nearly 55,000 Japanese are likely to come, a 
22.2-percent rise, Japanese tourism sources said. 
  The surge is due to visa exemptions for Japanese during 
"Visit Korea Year '94," the sources said. 
  The KNTC expects nearly 4 million foreigners to come this 
year, with Japanese accounting for half of the figure.
