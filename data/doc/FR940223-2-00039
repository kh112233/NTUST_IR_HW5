ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On October 21, 1993, EPA received an application from Monsanto Company for an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) for a transgenic
plant pesticide. This is the fourth EUP application under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
for testing with a pesticidal substance that is produced in a plant. The Agency has determined that this application
may be of regional and national significance. Therefore in accordance with 40 CFR 172.11(a), the Agency is soliciting
public comments on this application. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES

: Written comments must be received by March 25, 1994.

ADDRESSES:

 Comments, in triplicate, should bear the docket control number OPP50775 and be submitted to: Public Response
and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental
Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. In person bring comments to: Rm. 1128, Crystal Mall #2, 1921
Jefferson Davis Highway, Crystal City, VA 22202. 


Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all
of that information as ``Confidential Business Information'' (CBI). Information so marked will not be disclosed
except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain CBI must be
submitted for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA
without prior notice to the submitter. Written comments will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1128 at the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 On October 21, 1993, EPA received an application for an EUP from Monsanto Company, 700 Chesterfield Village Parkway,
St. Louis, Missouri 63198. The application was assigned EPA File Symbol 524EUPIE. Monsanto proposes
to test the cryIA(b) 

d

-endotoxin (derived from the soil microbe 

Bacillus thuringiensis

) as expressed in a series of corn lines from March 1, 1994, to February 28, 1995. The amino acid sequence of the 

d

-endotoxin in corn was maintained to be identical to the amino acid sequence produced in 

Bacillus thuringiensis

. However, the nucleotide sequence of the cryIA(b) gene was modified to enhance expression in corn. In addition to
expressing the cryIA(b) 

d

-endotoxin, the majority of the corn lines being evaluated also express the 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate
(CP4, ESPS) and/or glyphosate oxidoreductase (GOX) proteins which are used as selectable markers and bestow glyphosate
resistance. A minimal number of the cryIA(b) 

d

-endotoxin expressing corn lines expressed neomycin phosphotranferase II (NPTII) as the selectable marker. NPTII
bestows resistance to the common aminoglycoside antibiotics kanamycin, G418, or panomomycin. 


Several small-scale field experiments have been conducted under permits granted by the United States Department
of Agriculture. Larger scale testing is now required in order to further evaluate the performance of the expressed
protein against the European Corn Borer in various geographical areas in which corn is commercially produced. These
experiments include: Isopopulation yield trials, gene efficacy, ECB ecological studies, and various evaluations
of the Bt 

d

-endotoxin corn lines in combination with glyphosate. In addition to experiments related to efficacy, breeding
nursery and seed increase trials are planned. 
Up to 605 acres are proposed for planting with approximately 17,274 pounds of transgenic seed. This amount of seed
will contain approximately 205 grams (dry weight) of the cryIA(b) 

d

-endotoxin. The following States are included in the program: Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, and Puerto Rico. 
No temporary tolerances are being requested relative to the proposed experimental use permit since any reserved
transgenic plant material will be used only for research or future plantings. All other materials will be destroyed.
Professionally qualified Monsanto employees will supervise the program, which will be carried out by public and
private cooperators in addition to professionals at Monsanto test facilities. 
Upon review of the Monsanto application, any comments received in response to this notice and any other relevant information,
EPA will set conditions under which the experiments will be conducted. Any issuance of an EUP will be announced in the


Federal Register

.
