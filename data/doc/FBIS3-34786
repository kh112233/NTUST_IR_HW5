  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn today received French 
Foreign Affairs Minister Alain Juppe at the Royal Hashemite 
Court. They discussed various regional and world issues, as 
well as the latest developments in the Middle East peace 
process, particularly the Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed 
in Cairo last week. 
  His Majesty King Husayn stressed Jordan's position to 
support 
and back the peace process on the basis of the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the Security Council, particularly 
Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. 
  They also discussed the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
means to cooperate to end the suffering of the Muslims there and 
achieve security, stability, and peace in that region, which has 
suffered from tension, conflict, and the violation of human 
rights and dignity.
