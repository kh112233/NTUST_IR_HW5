PACIFIC NOTES 
Japan surpassed Britain last year to become the world's fourth-largest beer 
brewer, a Japanese beer company says. Kirin Brewery Co., Japan's biggest 
brewery, said world beer production rose 2% in 1989 to a record 28.8 billion 
gallons. 
The previous record was 28.2 billion in 1988, company officials said. The 
largest producer by far was the United States, with 6.07 billion gallons, up 
0.6% from 1988, Kirin said. U.S. brewers accounted for 21.1% of global 
production, the officials said. They said West Germany was second followed by 
China, Japan and Britain. The figures are based on data from beer associations 
around the world, Kirin said. In terms of per-capita beer consumption, the 
average West German downed 37.5 gallons in 1989, closely followed by East 
Germans, Czechoslovaks, Danes and Belgians, the officials said. They said the 
average American drank 23.3 gallons in 1989, while an average Japanese consumed 
12.3 gallons.
