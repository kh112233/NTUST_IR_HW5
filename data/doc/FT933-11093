FT  31 JUL 93 / World News in Brief: Bentley given limited pardon
Derek Bentley, hanged 40 years ago for murdering a policeman, has been
granted a posthumous pardon limited to sentence, home secretary Michael
Howard announced. Mr Howard said he believed a free pardon remained
inappropriate. Bentley's accomplice, who fired the shots that killed the
policeman, was too young to be executed.
