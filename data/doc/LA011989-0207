LOCAL; 
RAIL TRAGEDY AVERTED IN BUENA PARK 
Two Santa Fe Railroad employees pulled a woman and five children out of a car 
stopped on the railroad tracks in Buena Park this morning, just seconds before 
a passenger train crashed into the car, police said. 
Lorraine Ruiz, 26, of Buena Park was driving her 1967 Chevrolet across the 
railroad tracks north on Dale Avenue about 8:30 a.m. when the train-crossing 
arms came down on the trunk of the car, Buena Park Police Officer Rich McMillen 
said. 
"For unknown reasons, Ruiz stopped her vehicle on the tracks and did not go 
forward," he said. 
Santa Fe employees Joe Otero, 44, and Anthony Morales, 32, were working near 
the crossing and saw that a westbound Amtrak passenger train traveling about 55 
m.p.h. was about 100 yards away from colliding with the car. 
"They pulled the driver and five children from the vehicle just seconds before 
the collision," McMillen said. "The train demolished the car." 
After a brief inspection, the train continued on its route. There were no 
injuries.
