<H5>  Special Issue: Security, LAN, Network OS, and Open Systems </H5>
  The trend toward open systems should be welcomed by 
users. However, these kinds of open networks can also expose 
important business information to danger. This is because LAN 
hosts and servers can be easily accessed from outside the 
company. 
  Security can be guaranteed for the most part by using 
the built-in functions of network operating systems and by using 
techniques at the operational level. Products which supplement 
the areas of weakness are coming onto the market. However, when 
security is strengthened, there is concern that the original 
flexibility of an open system may be lost. 
<H5>  Part 1: The Rapid Increase of Dangerous Networks </H5>
  ``Linking'' techniques, which center on LANs such as 
TCP/IP, NetWare, and LAN Manager, etc., are bringing about the 
construction of a truly user-friendly environment. However, the 
down side to increasing the degree of freedom is that this 
so-called openness is creating security problems. 
  A variety of programs and databases on personal 
computer LAN servers, UNIX machines and mainframes can be 
accessed through LANs. However, there is a growing danger that 
sensitive and confidential information may be leaked by 
unauthorized people accessing and viewing it. 
  Mr. Hajime Iwasawa, chief inspector of the Kyowa Hakko 
Industrial Company's Information Systems Department, says 
``There continue to be about 10 instances of access by unknown 
parties.'' At Kyowa, employees can access the internal company 
system from outside locations through a subscriber phone 
network. A VAX, which is linked to a LAN and dedicated-use 
lines, distributes and coordinates calls, and it can be accessed 
from personal computers via TELNET of TCP/IP, etc. The VAX is 
used as a communications server for connecting to public 
networks. When we were randomly viewing the VAX surveillance 
terminal, a log-in showing a connection log-in failure was 
displayed. 
  Mr. Iwasawa said, ``As a result, we do not know who that 
person was.'' It may have been an employee who actually failed 
to get on, but there is no guarantee of that. Because it was 
randomly viewed on the surveillance terminal, who it was could 
be discovered. Because they are not always checking the logging 
operations, there may be other times when access is gained by 
unknown parties. 
  There was a recent incident of a computer virus infection at 
the National Cancer Center. The virus invaded nearly 200 
machines including NEC PC-9800s, Apple Macintoshes and IBM PCs. 
The tip of the arrow began with the use of reference searches 
and electronic mail by a NetWare personal computer LAN. 
Fortunately, the virus was simply one that made a sound, and 
losses were minimal. 
  Later, the source was found out because it was from a 
personal computer infected by a virus that had recorded its ID, 
etc. A virus that invades because of a little carelessness and 
spreads throughout an entire company is not that rare. 
  Both of these examples involve a process that occurs in an 
``open'' information system, and this makes it necessary to 
reconsider security measures. ``In conventional host-terminal 
systems, who can enter is determined naturally. However, in open 
systems, it is easy to connect with the network. We must be able 
to determine who may not enter,'' says Mr. Iwasawa of Kyowa 
Hakko. The number of businesses connected to networks is growing. 
<H5>  Security Is Compromised by Creating an Open System </H5>
  With downsizing and the creation of opening systems, 
information is expected to be liberated from a closed world. An 
environment is growing in which it is easy to connect to 
everything from personal computers to mainframes. Personal 
personal computer LAN network operating systems (NOS) such as 
NetWare from Novell and LAN Manager from Microsoft are 
reinforcing this openness, and standard protocols represented by 
TCP/IP are being supported. Mainframes also permit TCP/IP 
connection, and this sets up an environment that can be 
connected from top to bottom. 
  The number of personal computer terminals which can link up 
to networks is growing, and information resources such as access 
programs and databases are expanding and diversifying. A 
personal computer linked to a LAN creates an environment in 
which it is possible to access information that can be 
physically located anywhere. 
  On the other hand, network infrastructures which have this 
kind of flexibility and exapandability carry with them the 
weakness of being vulnerable to external enemies. They are easy 
to use, but they are fragile in relation to unauthorized access 
and acquisition of information. Nearly the entire structure is 
open to the outside, and this creates an environment that falls 
easy prey to unauthorized activities. 
<H5>  Guaranteeing That a User Is Authorized Is Difficult </H5>
  For a long time, systems have tried to verify who the user 
is 
when the host system is accessed. In the log-in procedure, the 
host side verifies that it is the correct user by having the 
user input an ID name and password. The procedure for confirming 
the user by ID name and password is the same in the world of 
personal computers, LANs, and UNIX. 
  In almost all cases of confirming whether or not a user is 
authorized, the ID and password are all there is. In a typical 
LAN system, if an ID and password are used, the program and 
database can be accessed from virtually anywhere. This practice 
receives high marks from the point of view of convenience. 
  However, if the ID and password are leaked, that's all there 
is. There have even been extreme examples when the ID and 
password were written on a memo pasted on the personal computer. 
That kind of loose management permits unauthorized use, and easy 
intrusion into the system. It is also possible to make a program 
that tries to gain access by substituting the passwords. 
  With PC LAN servers, access control functions are provided 
which can stipulate the range of programs or databases that can 
be accessed from the terminal of each user. The place where the 
control range is determined, however, is the user ID. If the ID 
and password are stolen, the control loses all meaning. 
<H3>  By Opening a System, Mainframe Utilities Are One Just Step 
Away </H3>
  Once a mainframe is opened up, security checks become a 
whole 
level softer. Conventionally, independent addresses were set to 
each individual terminal, and the connection between the host 
and the terminal was made by built-in coaxial cable or by a 
dedicated-use line. Specifically, a one-to-one correspondence 
was established between the communication port of the host and 
the terminal. Even in public network relays, such as subscriber 
telephone networks, terminal addresses are incorporated into 
independent procedures. Thus, these could not be called the 
world of easy access by ID and password alone. For example, even 
if the ID and password are found out, access cannot be made 
through a different terminal. There are also instances when the 
menu itself is varied. 
  As the protocol moves from individual to open, the 
circumstances change. A gateway is offered by which mainframes 
and third parties can access the host by TCP/IP from PCs, etc. 
However, when TCP/IP is used, unless special techniques are 
employed, the host cannot discriminate between terminals. 
  The connectivity of the TCP/IP open protocol implies that a 
terminal address for individual manufacturers cannot be 
implanted. All that can be requested is an ID and a password, 
and seen from the conventional vantage point, security is lax. 
<H5>  Data Can Be Easily Stolen </H5>
  There is the possibility of stealing data. In a LAN system, 
all data run on cables between nodes that are linked by 
segments. ``Even if access rights are restricted by ID and 
password, this information can be viewed and stolen,'' says Kazu 
Sugiyama, team leader of the Technology Development Department, 
Systems Business Department, Catena. 
  For example, by taking the electrical signals out from the 
cable at the circuit board and converting them to data, the data 
can be viewed on the monitor. If a LAN management analyzer is 
used, it is even more simple. LAN analyzers are convenient 
systems when analyzing traffic conditions and breakdowns, but in 
fact, data can be seen. If an analyzer system is installed in a 
PC which is connected to the LAN, data can be stolen right from 
there. Some information, such as personnel information, should 
not even be seen by people within the company. With an analyzer, 
this also is not difficult to see. 
  Furthermore, if the ID and password that are necessary to 
verify the user are stolen, the consequences can be grave. There 
is therefore a function to scramble password data in the NOS of 
such systems as NetWare and LAN Manager so the password cannot 
be easily stolen. UNIX systems do not have this function, 
however. 
<H3>  It Is Easy To Have Unauthorized Access Without Leaving 
Evidence Behind </H3>
  An issue that must be raised in PC LAN and UNIX systems is 
that ``no evidence of operation and processing remain behind,'' 
indicates Jiju Tabuchi, manager of the Software Business 
Division, Information Systems Business Department, Fujitsu. 
  After an incident has occurred, a mainframe can follow who 
did what operation. This technique can be used to stop 
unauthorized access. The logging functions are weak, however, in 
a PC LAN or UNIX system in which a supervisor (super-user) can 
easily do anything. If no logging has been done, then no prior 
cause can be specified. 
<H5>  Unprotected Networks Are Hotbeds for Viruses </H5>
  According to the numbers of reported cases of virus damage 
tabulated by the IPA [Information Processing Association], the 
number of cases jumped from 57 in 1991 to 229 in 1992. ``These 
numbers probably represent just the tip of the iceberg'' 
believes Norio Yuto, director of the IPA Technology Center, 
Computer Virus Technology Survey Laboratory. 
  Businesses are appearing that will provide general security 
services against the kind of virus that Konica suffered. This is 
because it is expected that the number of damaging viruses will 
increase in the future. 
  As networks become more widespread, they will become hotbeds 
for computer viruses. Viruses are destructive programs that 
become incorporated into ordinary programs, and the entrance 
ways for viruses increase with the spread of networks. There is 
the fear that once they invade, they can be transmitted to the 
entire system before anyone realizes it. 
  If a virus enters a jointly used program on the server, then 
it is immediately extended to the entire network. If a virus 
contaminates a program that must be executed whenever any LAN 
user logs in, for example, the LOGIN.EXE on the server, it is 
very serious. Moreover, it may be possible for a virus to invade 
a program in the commonly used region of the database engine. 
  Because programs like LOGIN.EXE are write-protected so that 
only users having supervisor rights can access them, it is 
difficult for viruses to invade them. On the other hand, the 
supervisors themselves must be extremely careful in the daily 
use of the LAN. If the PC that the supervisor uses becomes 
contaminated, the entire system may become contaminated. 
  In addition, network-type viruses have recently come on the 
scene. There are viruses that spread throughout the server by 
breaking the access privileges of such systems as NetWare. The 
feeling of safety with the security measures for yesterday's 
problems can be eaten away in surprising new counterassaults. 
<H5>  Users Have Little Feeling of Danger </H5>
  The numerous dangers reported so far are heightening more 
and 
more in the LAN-WAN connection environment. There is a great 
need and desire to be able to access and use databases from 
outside companies. If their traffic becomes too great, both 
branch stores and business offices want to use public networks 
such as subscriber telephone networks because of communication 
costs. Businessmen also desire to be able to search client 
databases from outside locations using portable PCs. 
  The other side of WAN connection, however, is that security 
countermeasures become more difficult. If the network is closed 
with a dedicated-use line in the same building, access is 
limited to physically connected terminals inside the company. 
However, the moment a port is used to connect the system to a 
public network, there is the possibility of access by numerous 
undesignated parties. 
  In this regard, there are few users who lend a hand in 
improving security. Generally, they have only a dilute sense of 
danger. There are data to suggest that 23% of companies 
do not 
use even the most basic of security countermeasures, the 
password. In June of 1992, the Japan Information Processing 
Development Committee (JIPDEC) conducted a survey of 4,649 user 
companies regarding security, and this was one of the results 
obtained in the responses from 1,894 companies. 
  Even if the need for security is recognized, ``it is a pain 
when it comes to the budget'', and it is a headache for most 
information system managers. Security countermeasures do not 
produce a result that could be called ``increasing the 
efficiency of business.'' Rather, security increases management 
activities, and it cannot help but increase the number of 
employees in the information systems department. 
  As a result, the issue becomes one of how to convert the 
value of information into money. According to Kiyoshi Ono, 
manager of the Network Technology Section, Open Systems 
Technology Division, Nomura General Research Institute, it is 
probably natural that we hear, ``Spending &yen;1,000 to protect 
&yen;100 is not good business.'' However, the situation 
continues to be a matter not of &yen;100 but of &yen;10,000 
worth of information being dropped into the open system from the 
host. This information is being immediately exposed to danger. 
<H5>  Part II: Checkpoints for Security Countermeasures </H5>
  Security countermeasures can be brought about without 
any particular custom products. How aware users are of such 
things as company rules and operating procedures plays a big 
role. There are companies that actually put a great deal of 
effort into security. 
  However, security and convenience are inversely 
related. Even with vital information, if you think about 
security exclusively and make access too tricky, it loses 
meaning to speak of an 'open' system. 
  Generally, although users do not have much of a sense of 
danger, there are already quite a few businesses that have taken 
up measures to guarantee security. 
  Showa Shell Oil has made a PC LAN and host connection with 
NetWare and TCP/IP, but they have taken their own measures to 
``keep security tight,'' says Kazuhiko Arai, manager of the 
Information Systems Laboratory. 
  At Citibank, the password for the PC LAN supervisor is split 
in half and controlled by separate people. The supervisorial 
functions of the system cannot be touched unless both are 
parties present. As represented by this, Citibank has built a 
network with strict supervision and tight security. 
  The mainstream attitudes still seem to be ``connection comes 
first'', and ``the system that is closed within the company is 
safe,'' reflects Kiyoshi Ono, Manager of the Network Technology 
Section, Open Systems Technology Division, Nomura General 
Research Institute). However, it is the opinion of Hajime 
Iwasawa, chief inspector of the Kyowa Hakko Industrial Co. 
Information Systems Department, that ``security must be studied 
from the design stage of the network on up.'' 
  While revising its business system and network in January 
1993, Kyowa Hakko initiated an eight-member environment 
management group within the Information Systems Department. It 
is a group set up to study network supervision, management 
systems, and tools -- including security countermeasures -- from 
the design stage up. If the information carried on the LAN is 
important, then security countermeasures will be necessary. 
Rather than struggle with security at that point in time, it is 
better to consider the possibilities from the beginning and 
include the countermeasures in the system. 
  Whenever there are security issues, however, ``there will be 
users who won't know what to do,'' according to Jiju Tabuchi, 
manager of Fujitsu Information Systems Business Department, 
Software Business Division. In that situation, one should 
consider the ``Security Evaluation Standards'' that were studied 
by the Japan Electronic Information Development Association 
(JEIDA).

  This is meant to be a scale by which security functions can 
be objectively evaluated, and it was put together in August of 
1992 by JEIDA as a proposal for security functions and 
requirements. ``Functions and requirements'' means making 
adjustments to meet security needs. These functions and 
requirements are currently under review, and they are scheduled 
to be formally published in January 1994. Furthermore, the 
security requirements needed to evaluate and implement these 
functions are standardized in the following steps. 
<H5>  Point 1: Regulating the Permissible Access Range </H5>
  A PC LAN utilizing NetWare was introduced at Ajinomoto, and 
intracompany standards on the use of NetWare were drafted in 
January 1993. Included among these standards were adjustments in 
user access control. Determinations were made for permissible 
data access by allotting disk space and classifying directory 
systems and users. ``If the users and applications increase, 
they will just fit into the pattern,'' says Mamoru Umino, 
section manager of the Information Processing Business 
Department, Ajinomoto. Because the directories have been 
systematized in it, ``when anything happens, it can be checked'' 
(Mr. Umino). 
  Connection is made by the proper use of NetWare, LAN 
Manager, 
or TCP/IP. Then, access is controlled by determining which users 
are permitted access to which programs and databases on the 
server. If these access controls are correctly implemented, then 
unauthorized access will be prevented. 
<H5>  Use of NOS Access Controls </H5>
  Both NetWare and LAN Manager have network OS (NOS) functions 
that provide the capability of restricting directory and file 
access privileges (Table 2-2). Basically, these programs utilize 
user-level controls that set rights for each user or each user 
group regarding such processing functions as read/write and 
create/delete. In NetWare there are eight kinds of controls, and 
in LAN Manager there are seven kinds. Both programs can set 
detailed access privileges. In actuality, many users are set up 
to have only such basic access privileges as reading and writing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  In NetWare, it is possible to set attributes, that is, to 
set 
directory or file units to erase prohibit. Attributes are given 
priority over user-level access rights. For example, even a user 
who can erase files cannot erase a given file if that file has 
an erase protect attribute. When someone wishes to erase that 
file, a request must be made to the specified user who can 
modify the attribute. 
  On the other hand, in LAN Manager, a ``share-level security 
function'' is provided. A password is allotted for each 
directory and file. A log-in must be performed for each of those 
resources. 
  There are also many access controls at the application level 
above the NOS, but they cannot override the access privileges 
set by the NOS. 
  Access control ``is not a difficult thing, but the 
combination of functions can be complicated'' according to 
Hajime Sugiyama, team leader of the SI Development Department, 
SI Business Main Division, Catena. Therefore, if the kind of 
systematization that Ajinomoto has done is implemented, the 
system structure is made more efficient, and when there is 
trouble, maintenance operations can be promoted more expediently. 
<H5>  Router Filter Functions Are Also Effective </H5>
  Citibank uses a router packet filtering function, and this 
can control access. Ten BASE-Ts were introduced on each floor, 
and an FDDI of these branch line LANs is linked into a trunk 
line LAN by using a router. ``The determination of which places 
can or cannot be linked with which other places is set by a 
router access list, '' says Kentaro Tachiiri, assistant 
vice-president of the Systems Main Department. 
  What Citibank has introduced is a ``AGS'' system, and a 
multiprotocol router can generally filter data by using a 
variety of conditions. Routers can filter not only by IP 
address, but also by discriminating higher ranking protocols and 
applications. At Citibank, in addition to IP addresses, the 
router restricts passes between networks that can communicate by 
such protocols and applications as DECnet, NetWare, and 
Apple-Talk. Mr. Tachiiri says that a system was adopted so that 
``when it is necessary to modify or add passes, approval of the 
security manager must be obtained.'' 
  In addition to security functions, router filtering has 
significance in that data that do not have relation to that 
segment does not flow there, thus making it effective in 
reducing unnecessary traffic. However, ``when too may filtering 
conditions are set, the processing for routing causes delays'' 
according to Takehiko Higashi, business department manager of 
Network Systems. 
<H3>  Point 2: Increasing Checkpoints Corresponding to the 
Importance of the Information </H3>
<H5>  Strengthening Confirmation of the Authorized User </H5>
  At Showa Shell Oil, security has been strengthened, and 
strict conditions for identification of an authorized user have 
been set to the extent that ``vital information can only be 
accessed from the PC of that user,'' claims Kazuhiko Arai, 
manager of the Information Systems Lab, Showa Shell Oil. A 
management code has been installed on the PC FMR LAN board that 
is in the LAN terminals. When information of importance is 
accessed, in addition to the user ID and password, the 
management code is simultaneously checked. For this reason, even 
if another's ID and password are known, access from a different 
PC is not possible. 
  Even if restrictions are placed on resources that can be 
used 
by each user through the control of access, is the user making 
access truly the person indicated in the ID? How do we know 
whether this is not some other person making unauthorized use of 
the ID and password? At Showa Shell, depending on the 
information, if it is not the right PC, the conditions to deny 
access have increased, and the probability that it is an 
authorized user have been heightened. 
  In addition to this, Showa Shell is also using the technique 
of ``displaying the name of the user on the upper right part of 
the screen.'' This is also a method of discovering right away 
with a glance at the screen whether another user's ID and 
password is being used. 
<H3>  Strict Checks or Restricted Functions Placed on the Public 
Network That Make It Easy for External Enemies To Gain Entrance </H3>
  Currently Showa Shell is studying the possibility of 
connecting to a public network in order to allow access from the 
outside by support businessmen, etc. However, ``this is a threat 
to security'' (Kazuhiko Arai), and there are many users who are 
nervous about connecting with a public network. 
  For users connecting with public networks, there have 
already 
been restrictions placed on functions, and the check items for 
logging in have increased. 
  The Kumatani Group is restricting the use of subscriber 
telephone network routes so that ``the only possible use is for 
electronic mail'' (Akira Doi, Information Systems Lab, Third 
Division, Development Section). The mainframe and the PC LAN 
server are connected by an intracompany LAN, and this is mainly 
coordinated by TCP/IP; and there are also SUN workstations that 
are equipped to connect with subscriber telephone networks. 
There are IDs and passwords required specifically at the level 
of accessing these workstations. After that, the ID and password 
of the original user are input. Attention is paid to double 
passwords and restricting use to electronic mail. 
  This is also a technique for safely using a VAN. When 
communicating through a VAN, because the ID and password for 
entering the VAN must be checked, the ID/password check is 
doubled. Showa Hakko has evaluated this VAN security function, 
and has connected business locations that have low traffic by 
using a VAN. 
  In addition to VANs, Ajinomoto is using ``call back.'' In 
call back, access to the host is made from the terminal side, 
the ID and password are input, and the circuit is disconnected; 
afterwards, the circuit connection is made from the host side. 
The telephone number of the business location or home must 
already be recorded, and security is provided by denying access 
from any location other than the one recorded. 
  Ajinomoto uses an internal modem call back function, but 
custom equipment is also being marketed. For example, there is 
Defender, which is made by the American firm Digital PassWare 
and which is being handled by Chiyoda Information Machines. The 
ID, password, and password period of validity can be set and 
processed independently, and ``it places no burden on the host'' 
(Mr. Yoshihiko Kamimori, Sales Department Section 2, Eastern 
Japan Information Communications Business Department, Chiyoda 
Information Machines). 
<H5>  Verification of the User by Cards </H5>
  Defender offers one solution to the problem of restricted 
call back locations by using the SecureNet Key. This is a card 
with an input key that resembles a credit card-sized calculator, 
and the premise is that authorized users have this card. 
  How the card works and how it reports to the host side are 
shown in Figure 2-3 (not reproduced). When accessed, the host 
responds with a number that is called a challenge number. When 
the user inputs this to the card, the password is displayed. 
This password is input from the terminal. Because the challenge 
number is modified at each instance of access, the password 
changes every time. Every card is equipped with a special 
mathematical algorithm, and even if the same challenge number is 
input to a different card, a different value is returned. 
  Metro is scheduled to market the product ``SafeWord'' which 
uses the same technique on NetWare. It will be offered in the 
form of an NLM (NetWare-loadable module), which is a NetWare 
server application. Before the user logs on to the server, the 
SafeWord password is calculated by using the card. ``Because the 
password changes every time, it is safe even if monitored by an 
analyzer'' (Akio Araki, manager of the Business Technology 
Department, Information Security Systems Business Department, 
Metro). 
  SafeWord was developed by the American company Enigma Logic, 
and Metro is already marketing products for mainframes and 
minicomputers. 
<H5>  Point 3: Do Not Create Weak Spots </H5>
  It is particularly important not to create weak spots within 
open system security countermeasures. ``If a thief sneaks into 
one person's house, from there he will sneak into another's 
house'' says Hirofumi Katase, assistant section manager of the 
Data Processing Promotion Division, Machinery and Information 
Industries Bureau, MITI. 
  For example, even if techniques are created so that only 
specified users are permitted access to important data, when 
important data are downloaded into the client PC's hard disk, 
the effectiveness of countermeasures is reduced in half. Anybody 
can see the contents of PC's hard disk just by powering up. It 
data are downloaded to a floppy disk, it is also important to 
manage that floppy disk. 
  Moreover, computer viruses can spread injury throughout a 
company as a result of a little inattention from an individual. 
There are many companies that require that permission be 
obtained from their information systems department when users 
want to use software on their own. Use is confirmed by the 
information systems department after it has evaluated the 
software itself (this includes checking it for viruses). 
<H5>  Management Down to the Contents of the Individual PC </H5>
  They are very strict on this particular point at Showa Shell 
Oil. ``It is a company rule that neither downloading data onto a 
PC nor incorporating a program is permitted'' according to 
Kazuhiko Arai, manager of the Information Systems Lab. 
  At Showa Shell Oil, basically all company PCs have the same 
software installed by the Information Systems Lab, and a unified 
menu has been created. When it comes time for a new version of 
the software, they are all reinstalled. ``Even if the data 
stored in the PC are destroyed, there will be no complaints,'' 
says Mr. Arai. 
  When the end user wishes to use special applications, a 
request must be made to the Information Systems Lab. They are so 
thorough that when a special application has been approved, a 
seal is pasted on the PC saying that a special application is in 
use. 
  In any event, it is very important that security 
countermeasures are provided at the same level throughout the 
network. For example, even if access control is very tight for 
each user, ``it has no meaning if there is a ``guest'' ID that 
can enter without a password,'' says Shinichi Fukuda, manager of 
the PC First Technology Section 1, Personal Information Business 
Main Office, Technology Department, Sony. 
<H3>  Point 4. Consider the Balance Between Security and 
Flexibility </H3>
  When security countermeasures are promoted, freedom is lost. 
As with Citibank, when a router filtering function is run, 
freedom is restricted so that access from the PCs on another 
floor is not possible. As with Showa Shell, when a management 
code is embedded in the PCs, ``employees on assignment cannot 
access the host'' (Kazuhiko Arai). It cannot be denied that the 
ease of use has been diminished. 
  Meanwhile, the burden on the Information Systems Department 
has increased. It is necessary to create an access control list 
and manage IDs and passwords. Furthermore, if safety is a 
consideration, it is necessary to pay attention to periodically 
changing passwords. 
<H3>  Encrypting is Bothersome to Use in Terms of CPU Burden and 
Key Management </H3>
  Moreover, although encryption is an effective means of 
countering theft, it is not becoming very widespread because it 
increases costs and places a burden on the CPU as a result of 
the encryption processing. It also entails such problems as the 
need to manage the key which that goes along with encryption. 
  Generally, encryption involves the use of a secret key 
encryption method such as DES (Data Encryption Standard) or FEAL 
(fast data encipherment algorithm) developed by NTT. In these 
secret key encryption methods, it is necessary for both the 
transmitter and the receiver to maintain the same secret key 
data. 
  If there is a one-to-one relationship of communication 
partners, there is very little problem with this. However, when 
there is N-to-N communications as with LANs, it is very 
difficult to have common keys. It is possible to have a method 
in which there are key data in relation to all of the client PC 
partners, but it is dangerous to store secret key data on the 
hard disks of DOS machines. 
  Because of encryption processing, the burden placed on the 
CPU is increased. There are also LSIs being offered for 
encryption processing, but costs are prohibitive when it comes 
to installing them into all of the PCs, and even then, several 
problems remain. Currently, these LSIs are most often used in 
limited areas such as in transmitting encrypted files between 
specified partners. 
  Security countermeasures require expense and man hours, and 
they carry with them the fear of losing the freedom of the open 
system. A balance must be struck between security and 
flexibility. Efforts to study this should be made as early as 
possible. 
<H5>  Key Management and Electronic Seals in the Use of Encryption </H5>
  Encryption is a powerful means of guaranteeing secrecy, but 
somehow having joint use of the same key is a problem. KPS (key 
predistribution system) is being developed as a means of solving 
this problem. Also, electronic seal systems which utilize 
encryption technology are being commercialized. 
<H5>  KPS Allows Joint Use of the Key by Input of the Partner's ID </H5>
  KPS is a system developed by Professor Hideki Imai of Tokyo 
University. The assumption is that individual cards will be 
issued for each user, at which time the ID is set. During 
transmission by encryption, joint use of the key is possible by 
simply entering the partner's ID. Because the IDs can be 
publicly known, management is simple without making mistakes 
about the encryption key data. 
  Currently, Advance markets a system that encrypts and 
decodes 
PC files using KPS. In this system, the DES method has been 
adopted for encryption processing. Because key production and 
DES encryption processing are all done within an IC card, the 
safety is very high. 
<H5>  Electronic Seal Uses ESIGN by NTT </H5>
  NTT Advanced Technology is commercializing an electronic 
seal 
systems. This is a system that uses ESIGN, which is an 
encryption method developed by NTT. It is a system called a 
digital signature, and it applies secret key data as a seal. 
  As with ordinary seals, 1) only the person having that seal 
data can seal the document (it cannot be forged by other people, 
and even the authorized person cannot deny it afterwards), and 
2) if there is tampering in the process of delivering it to the 
partner, there is an electronic means for the receiver side to 
find out if there was tampering. EDI (electronic data 
interchange) is becoming popular, and it will be a very 
important technology for transactions of data, such as vouchers, 
between companies. 
  Although the functional roles of KPS and ESIGN vary, IC card 
systems are used. For this reason, they are expensive when there 
are numerous users using them on a LAN. Because they are not 
matched to the NOS and applications when used on a LAN, KPS and 
ESIGN are not good in terms of processing file units and the 
ease of use.
