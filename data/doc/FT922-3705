FT  10 JUN 92 / Letter: Jubilee Line extension much more than just Canary
Wharf link
Sir, Your article on the extension of the Jubilee Line ('No jubilation at
the end of the line', June 5) fails to recognise its wider benefits.
The extension would serve not only Canary Wharf but also the growing City
overspill on the south bank, and the Surrey Quays areas of Docklands, as
well as provide a much needed rail extension to Greenwich.
On a wider level it is important in the strategic development of east
London, including Stratford with its Channel Tunnel rail link with Europe.
Through its connection with the proposed East London line extension, it
would link new areas of London into the underground network - especially
those with high unemployment, including Peckham and Hackney.
Lack of proper transport facilities has long been both a bar to people in
these areas getting access to jobs elsewhere, and also a deterrent to
prospective employers moving into the area.
Councils that lie along the planned extensions of both the East London and
Jubilee Lines support the developments for very obvious social and economic
reasons. We have also won the support of private sector employers which
share our concerns that the future development and success of London will
depend on the provision of proper infrastructure  - especially transport,
The problems facing Canary Wharf should not blind planners to the fact that
London - like the Financial Times - is moving southwards and eastwards. The
underground network must move with it.
