FT  21 MAR 94 / Spielberg set for Oscar
Tonight promises to be the night that Steven Spielberg, financially the most
successful director in film industry history, receives the artistic
recognition that Hollywood has long denied him.
Spielberg, the director of the hit films ET and Jurassic Park, is the strong
favourite to win the best-director award at that annual rite of prize-giving
and mutual admiration, the Oscar ceremony. The awards are voted on by the
4,755 leading members of the US film industry who belong to the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
The award would be for Schindler's List, a black-and-white film about the
Nazi holocaust against the Jews of Europe, which has been nominated for 12
Oscars and has won critical acclaim for its sensitive handling of the
subject.
His film's main challenger in many of the Oscar categories could be The
Piano, a highly original art-house film by the New Zealand director Jane
Campion, which deals with 19th century eroticism in the antipodes. Its star,
the American Holly Hunter, is widely tipped for the best actress award.
A fistful of awards would be a big boost for the studio which backed
Schindler's List - Universal, part of the MCA group bought by Japan's
Matsushita electronics group. Universal has had a mixed box office record in
recent years, though it had a huge hit last year with Spielberg's dinosaur
movie, Jurassic Park.
Matsushita is said to be seeking other outside investors in MCA. Its
Japanese rival, Sony, has acknowledged that it is considering bringing in
new investor to its Columbia studios, which also have a mixed record.
Oscar rewards for The Piano would be a fillip to Walt Disney, which agreed
last May to buy the film's distributor, a small independent, Miramax.
After the mutual back-slapping of Oscar night, Hollywood's financial brains
will return to focus on the film industry's next big hurdle - its release
programme for the important summer season in America.
Analysts are forecasting a summer of record US box office returns, thanks to
a group of potentially strong selling films, including a new animated
feature from Disney called the Lion King.
None of them, however, is likely to match the success of Jurassic Park last
summer.
