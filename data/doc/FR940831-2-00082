 Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends
to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on the fish passage capability at the Red Bluff Diversion Dam (RBDD).
The EIS, in conjunction with the ongoing planning study, will evaluate alternative methods to improve fish passage
both upstream and downstream on the Sacramento River. Inefficient fish passage at RBDD has been identified as a contributing
factor in the decline in the populations of anadromous fishes (mainly salmon and steelhead) in the upper Sacramento
River.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Sacramento River supports the largest run of Chinook salmon and provides more spawning habitat for them than any
other river in the State of California. Each year, four different runs of Chinook salmon spawn in the Sacramento River
(spring, fall, late fall, winter). Closure of the RBDD gates in August 1966 restricted upstream passage and created
additional mortality factors for all four Chinook runs and steelhead. The most significant decline has been experienced
by the winter-run Chinook salmon, now protected under Federal and State Endangered Species Acts. The winter-run
is listed as endangered by both the Federal and State acts. 



The objectives of the planning study are to improve fish passage capability at the RBDD for upstream and downstream
migrations on the river while attempting to: 

(1) Continue water deliveries to the Tehama-Colusa Canal and Corning Canal systems in the quantities and according
to the timing necessary to meet demands; 

(2) Maintain existing authorized purposes of the Central Valley Project; and, 

(3) Otherwise prevent serious adverse impacts. 

A public scoping process integrated with the ongoing planning study will be used to elicit information for use in determining
the scope of the environmental impacts and issues related to the proposal and to determine alternative methods to
accomplish the goals of the project. The results of the scoping process will help Reclamation develop concepts for
improvement of fish passage and to determine the scope and extent of the impact analysis. Integration of the scoping
study with the planning study, before engineering feasibilities of the alternatives have been determined, will
significantly prolong the scoping process and make it more exhaustive. That is typical. However, it will maximize
the opportunity for public involvement in the development of alternatives. The scoping process may consist of public
meetings, private consultation, written comments or combinations of these. A subsequent notice will be published
in the 

Federal Register

 at least 30 days prior to the first formal, public scoping meeting.
