W. GERMANS ASSURED OF BEER'S FRESHNESS 
West Germans, who lead the world in per capita consumption of beer, will be 
getting a guarantee of freshness this year with every brew. 
Beginning today, the nation's 2,500 breweries must stamp a freshness date on 
each container and guarantee the product's quality until that time, the 
Bavarian Interior Ministry announced last week.
