RACING OFFICIAL, FAMILY SLAIN 
A top official of the Texas Racing Commission, his wife and their two children 
were found shot to death in their home hours after the commission said it might 
revoke the license of the only horse track in the state. 
Police said today it was unclear whether the four were killed by someone 
outside the family or whether the killings were part of a murder-suicide 
scheme. 
David Joost was director of administration at the Racing Commission and his 
wife, Susan, also worked there. Neither of the Joosts turned up at work Monday. 
The bodies were discovered in the Joost home, about 12 miles south of Austin, 
after police were asked to investigate. 
Earlier Monday, the Racing Commission said it was considering revoking the 
license of G. Rollie White Downs, the only Texas track to offer pari-mutuel 
betting since the Legislature approved horse racing in 1987.
