VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
FUND TO HELP MAN WHO LOST HIS FEET 
Friends of a man whose feet were severed in a train accident in Simi Valley are 
establishing a $10,000 medical fund to buy artificial limbs. 
Don Swanson, a friend of accident victim Steven Frye Jr., said the 
23-year-old's medical insurance does not cover the cost of special limbs that 
would allow Frye to continue athletics. 
Frye has been recovering from injuries he suffered Sept. 4 when he was struck 
by a Southern Pacific Railroad train while bicycling in the Santa Susana tunnel 
near Simi Valley. 
Before the accident, Frye worked in the accounting department of Farmers 
Insurance and is planning to return after his recovery, Susie Frye, his 
stepmother, said. 
Frye has already undergone extensive surgery and faces more, Swanson said. 
Organizers have raised about $4,500 for the purchase of two flexible artificial 
feet. 
Friends will hold a benefit golf tournament Nov. 19 at Sunset Hills Country 
Club in Thousand Oaks. Organizers are asking for $300 donations to participate 
in the tournament and luncheon. Donors who do not intend to golf can donate 
$225, with all the money going to the family. PSYCHE PASCUAL
