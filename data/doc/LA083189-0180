BRIEFLY 
Group Offers $200 Million for Arby's: A group of eight franchisees said it has 
offered more than $200 million in cash to buy the Arby's fast-food chain from 
DWG Corp., the holding company controlled by industrialist Victor Posner. The 
group, calling itself R. B. Partners Ltd., said it made the offer Aug. 1 in a 
letter to Posner, who has so far not responded to the proposal. In a letter to 
fellow franchisees, the group said Posner's legal and financial problems could 
threaten the future of Atlanta-based Arby's. Posner pleaded no contest in 1987 
to federal income tax evasion and was sentenced last year to five years 
probation. DWG, a Miami-based holding company, controls Arby's Inc., the 
marketing, franchising and service company for the 2,100-store Arby's 
restaurant chain.
