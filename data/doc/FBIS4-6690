  [Text] Kobe, April 19 KYODO -- Police searched the office 
of a Japanese trader Tuesday [19 April] on suspicion that it 
illegally remitted 118,860 dollars to the banking account of a 
North Korean trading house based in Pyongyang. The trading 
company, Mitaka Boeki, allegedly contravened a requirement under 
the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law to report to 
the finance minister any overseas remittance of money exceeding 
5 million yen. 
  Investigators suspect the company fabricated a contract 
document regarding the import of North Korean marine products to 
make the banking remittance look legal, police said. 
  Police said they suspect the Kobe-based trader also exported 
50 used cars worth 255,000 dollars to North Korea without 
obtaining the required permission from the prefectural public 
safety commission. 
  Remittances of money from pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in 
Japan to North Korea have come under scrutiny in connection with 
allegations that Pyongyang is trying to develop nuclear weapons. 
Some U.S. Congress members and government officials have been 
urging Japan to regulate the flow of money which the Japanese 
Cabinet Information Research Office reportedly estimates at up 
to 200 billion yen a year. 
  Earlier this year, police raided another Japanese trading 
company on suspicion that they exported to North Korea 
high-technology equipment capable of being used for military 
purposes. 
  The Yokohama-based trading house was searched on January 14 
on suspicion that it exported a spectrum analyzer that could be 
used to boost the target-hitting accuracy of the Nodong-1 
missiles Pyongyang test-fired in the Sea of Japan last year. 
Police arrested the president of the company, Masahiko Kondo, 
on the day and sent papers to the prosecutors on March 30.
