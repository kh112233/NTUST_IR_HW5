FT  29 SEP 92 / Technology: Old tyres take on a new life
The global mountain of several billion old tyres represents a tempting store
of materials and energy - and several ambitious projects are under way in
the US and Europe to recycle used tyres and/or burn them in power plants.
A machine for recycling tyres on a smaller scale is the Multi-Purpose
Disposer (MPD), launched this month by AEA-Beven, a joint venture between
AEA Technology of Harwell and Herbert Beven, a UK engineering company.
Each MPD, which will cost about Pounds 250,000, can consume 100,000 tyres
per year by pyrolysis. It heats them to a high temperature (above 1,000 deg
C) in the absence of oxygen. This breaks the tyres down chemically into four
by-products:
Fuel gas can be used to heat the MPD itself or burned off-line in a furnace
or boiler.
Fuel oil, similar to diesel, can also be burned in the plant or elsewhere.
Carbon or 'char' has a range of applications, including absorption of
organic chemicals from industrial effluent.
Steel is clean scrap for reprocessing.
The first MPD has been sold to North American Tyre Recycling, which has an
exclusive licensing agreement to market and manufacture the system in the US
and Canada. The company expects to sell 90 units over the next five years in
North America, where the stockpile of discarded tyres is estimated at about
3bn.
The demand is expected to come from tyre remoulders, waste management
companies and local authorities faced with large numbers of tyres clogging
up their landfill sites.
Ray Allen, head of AEA environmental engineering department, says there is
no competing technology for disposing cleanly of tyres on a small, local
scale.
The MPD makes it possible to process waste tyres where they arise - avoiding
the need for costly and environmentally damaging transportation to a large
central site.
And AEA says the machine emits less pollution (nitrogen oxides and sulphur
dioxide) than conventional large incinerators.
