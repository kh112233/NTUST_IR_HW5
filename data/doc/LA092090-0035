SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Jury selection in the murder case of Stacy Butler, accused of killing a San 
Diego police officer, will begin Oct. 19, a judge ruled Wednesday. 
Butler, 27, of San Diego, is charged in the slaying of Officer Jerry Hartless, 
24, who was shot in the forehead in Southeast San Diego on Jan. 9, 1988. 
He died three weeks later. 
Superior Court Judge William Kennedy set the trial date for Oct. 19. 
One of Butler's attorneys, William Nimmo, said jury selection may last two 
months. 
The district attorney's office has filed special circumstances allegations 
against Butler, and he could receive the death penalty if convicted of 
first-degree murder. The special circumstances allege that Hartless was killed 
while in the performance of his police duties.
