BRIEFLY 
Leona Helmsley's Appeal Argued: The hotel queen's lawyer appealed her 
income-tax evasion conviction in New York, arguing that prosecutors used her 
testimony before a state grand jury to convict her in federal court. Members of 
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to be receptive at least in part 
to arguments of her attorney, Harvard Law school professor Alan Dershowitz. 
Helmsley, 70, was convicted in U.S. District Court a year ago of 33 criminal 
charges when a jury found her guilty of evading $1.2 million in taxes between 
1983 and 1985. She was sentenced to 4 years in prison and a $7.1-million fine. 
Helmsley is free on bail. Dershowitz also argued the case brought against 
Helmsley was tainted because it was based on her testimony before a state grand 
jury. He said information from the secret state panel was used to bring the 
federal indictment. Dershowitz called the tie between her state testimony and 
the federal indictment a "direct chain of causation."
