WORLD; 
COLOMBIAN'S RELATIVES KIDNAPED 
Gunmen kidnaped the wife and the sister of a Colombian congressman and shot 
their driver to death in the capital Wednesday night, police said today. 
Maruja Pachon, a journalist and wife of Liberal Party congressman Alberto 
Villamizar, and his sister, Beatriz, were seized by several gunmen as they 
drove home from work, police said. 
Pachon, who is also the sister-in-law of assassinated Liberal Party 
presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan, is the eighth journalist kidnaped in 
Colombia in 10 weeks. 
Pachon is the manager of Focine, a state body that promotes Colombian 
film-making. Beatriz Villamizar is head of the press office at Focine. Alberto 
Villamizar has proposed reforms of drug laws. 
The Extraditables, Colombia's most powerful cocaine traffickers, have admitted 
kidnaping the other journalists, including the daughter of a former president.
