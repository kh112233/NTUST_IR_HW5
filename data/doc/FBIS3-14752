  [Text] Tallinn, Feb 25, BNS -- Cooperation between the 
Baltic states is at present one of Estonia's first priorities, 
said President Lennart Meri in an interview to the Lithuanian 
RESPUBLIKA newspaper. 
  "If our cooperation is limited to questions of security 
systems or foreign policy, everything may remain at the level of 
mere rhetoric," Meri noted. He said the Baltic states must 
realize that, under their geopolitical conditions, issues of 
security and foreign policy can be solved only if they have a 
common economic basis. 
  In Meri's opinion, the Baltic states' cooperation must 
proceed from integrating their energy systems, which would set 
them free from dependence on Russia. 
  "Realization of our independence would allow us to regard 
Russia in a considerably friendlier light," the Estonian 
president stated.
