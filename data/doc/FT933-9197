FT  11 AUG 93 / Businesses angry at maternity cost
EMPLOYERS' and women's organisations reacted angrily yesterday to a
government announcement that businesses would have to meet all costs of
improvements to maternity benefits required by a European Community
directive.
A consultation document issued by the Department of Social Security puts the
cost to employers of increased benefits at Pounds 55m-Pounds 75m a year,
excluding the administrative expenses of implementing the changes.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, described the additional burden
on employers as 'relatively small - Pounds 190 or Pounds 290 per expectant
working mother'.
The Institute of Directors said business and women would be the main losers.
Business should not have to pay what was essentially a social cost.
Dr Ann Robinson, IoD policy unit head, said: 'The extra cost involved in
employing women of childbearing age could handicap their employment
prospects.'
Ms Jenny Earle, legal officer of The Maternity Alliance, a group covering a
number of women's organisations, unions and charities, said the 'state
should provide the statutory minimum, with a top-up to full pay being
provided by employers'.
Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's spokesperson on women's issues, said: 'This is
a minimalist approach proposed by a mean-minded government.' One in five
women would continue to have no rights whatsoever to statutory maternity
pay.
Under current rules employers are reimbursed fully for the statutory 18
weeks of maternity pay they give workers. Mr Lilley put forward two options
for improvements to the scheme. The first would meet the minimum EC
requirements by improving benefits for 14 weeks and keep them at the present
rates for the other four weeks. The second option would increase benefits
for the whole of the 18 weeks.
