FT  10 AUG 94 / Business and the Environment: A hole in the net of fishing's
future - Skirmishes over cod and tuna reflect worsening stock depletion
worldwide
This month's clashes between fishermen about cod and tuna in the Arctic and
the Bay of Biscay are symptoms of a wider problem - the depletion of fish
stocks around the world.
The Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) calculates that there have been 20 such
incidents worldwide in the past 18 months, as fishermen move into rivals'
hunting grounds in search of new outlets to remain profitable.
They are caught in a vicious circle. As fish stocks become more scarce, they
fetch a higher price, raising the incentive for fishermen to intensify their
effort.
The problem, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO), is exacerbated by the subsidies that governments provide
to fleets, for example, in aid to shipbuilders, or grants for fishing gear.
It is also difficult to measure a resource at the mercy of changes in
weather or currents. Fishing quota systems are based on scientists'
estimates of stocks and may be in error by up to 20 per cent, says John
Caddy, head of the FAO's marine resource service. 'If they make the mistake
several times, there's a possibility the stock will become seriously
depleted,' he said.
The EU's common fisheries policy has helped create conflicts between
fishermen by allocating quotas to single species like cod, says Indrani
Lutchman, fisheries officer for the WWF. That creates heavy pressure on
those species and drives fishermen to other zones when stocks fall.
Defenders argue that conflicts between fishermen would be greater if oceans
were open to all comers, especially as declining stock leads to collapse in
areas such as Newfoundland.
The catch from the world's oceans has been falling since it hit a peak of
86.4m tonnes in 1989, according to the FAO. Three years later it was about
80m tonnes.
Most of the north Atlantic, north Pacific, Mediterranean and Black Sea is
overfished, as are the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. More fishing in
these areas will produce smaller catches.
The greatest decline is in the most highly valued fish, such as sole and
plaice, and in standard-priced finfish like cod, haddock, and mackerel.
Overfishing is also affecting marine and lake fish such as sardines and
tilapias.
As fleets turn to new fishing grounds, these, too, are at risk of
overexploitation, says the WWF (see graph). The Anglo-Spanish confrontation
in the Bay of Biscay is about albacore tuna. There are no EU quotas for
albacore, but that may change if driftnet fishing practised by French and
British vessels depletes the population, as scientists fear.
Lutchman wants these dangers addressed at a United Nations conference
starting in New York next week on managing fish stocks in the high seas,
beyond the reach of individual countries' 200-mile exclusion zones.
She believes global fleet reductions are the answer. Management regimes,
using enforced quotas and restrictions on fishing tackle, can also work, for
example off north Norway, where stocks are healthy. Such controls are the
FAO's preferred solution, since they allow stocks to recover and reduce the
number of discarded fish, which account for more than 10 per cent of the
catch in many fisheries.
The FAO also advocates a return to exclusive fishing rights - allocating
specific areas or stocks to certain groups of fishermen - to encourage
conservation. Caddy cites the huge investment in artificial reefs around the
Japanese coast, which protect stocks from predators.
But global solutions require agreements between coastal states,
long-distance fishing nations such as Japan, Korea and Spain, and
unregulated fishing vessels flying flags of convenience.
That is one challenge facing the UN conference, which began work in 1993 and
is due to wind up at the end of August. Even if a treaty were thrashed out,
the question remains of burgeoning populations facing dwindling supplies.
The FAO proposes that smaller fish caught as feed for animals and fish
farming should be used for human consumption instead, as quality and
freezing methods improve. About 30 per cent of the world catch is turned to
fishmeal.
Without such a shift, the outlook for the human diet is gloomy, says the
FAO. If more and more sea fish are caught purely for fish meal the danger is
that humans will no longer enjoy fish from the wild. 'The impact would be
the loss of the present wide spectrum of food items that the existing 1,000
commercial species now provide, to be replaced by very few species providing
only differences in flesh, colour and texture.'
