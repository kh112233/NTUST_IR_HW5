FT  22 OCT 92 / Gunmen kill UK tourist in Egypt
A British tourist was killed and two wounded yesterday when gunmen opened
fire on a tour bus near the southern Egyptian town of Assiut - a hotbed of
Islamic extremism, writes Tony Walker from Cairo.
Egyptian police said that gunmen ambushed the tour bus near the town of
Dayrut, which has, for months, been the focus of a bitter feud between
Islamic militants and security forces.
