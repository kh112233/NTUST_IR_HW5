SURROGATE MOM'S CUSTODY CLAIM 
The editorial missed the main issue: Should surrogacy contracts be legal? And 
should the state protect us from the truth surrounding our birth and 
progenitors? 
Surrogacy usually necessitates an adoption. 
Adoption experts have been publishing repudiations of their previous support 
for not only the secrecy mandated in the "adoption option" but the necessity 
for adoption itself since we now know that adoptees represent an alarmingly 
high ratio in psychiatric therapy in most psychiatric facilities. Surrogacy 
proponents will undoubtedly retract their views as they accumulate data on how 
desperation and deceit affect parties who had only the best of intentions. 
Alternate solutions for Baby Johnson include shared custody or guardianship 
with visitation by the non-custodial parent. 
In August, five California legislators voted out AB-3907, which would have 
permitted adoptees and parents the civil and human right to decide for 
themselves whether they wish to associate. A federal judge in Los Angeles 
denied adoptees and parents on AmFOR's class action challenging sealed adoption 
access to the courts. Meanwhile, adoptive parents in several states have been 
winning suits to return their "unsatisfactory" adoptive children. California 
has taken a giant step backward for mankind.
