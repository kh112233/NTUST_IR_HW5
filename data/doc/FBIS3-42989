  [Text] Kyrgyzstan possesses a developed electric power 
system which fully meets the needs of the republic's economy for 
electric power and which transmits one-third of its production 
to the consolidated power grid of Central Asia and southern 
Kazakhstan. 
  The power system incorporates 20 power stations with a total 
installed capacity of 3,384 MW including 18 hydroelectric plants 
(2,710 MW) and two heat and power plants in Bishkek and Osh (674 
MW). Other large power stations are the Toktogul hydroelectric 
plant (1,200 MW), Kurpsay hydroelectric plant (800 MW), Bishkek 
heat and power plant (624 MW), Tash-Kumyr hydroelectric plant 
(450 MW), and Uch-Kurgan hydroelectric plant (180 MW).

  The power system's electric networks contain 500-kV aerial 
power transmission lines (VL) extending 541 km, 1,009 km of 
220-kV lines, 4,301 km of 110-kV lines, and 4,172 km of 35-kV 
lines and more than 60,000 km of 10-0.4-kV distribution lines. 
There are 481 35-500-kV step-down transformer substations with a 
total capacity of 7,787 MVA. 
  The power system is involved in central heat supply in the 
cities of Bishkek, Osh, Kara-Kol, Kyzyl-Kiya, and Kara-Kul. The 
total length of thermal networks is 460 km. The power system's 
heat sources annually produce 5,500-5,700 thousand Gcal or 
39% 
of the thermal energy consumed in the republic. 
  In 1992, the power system generated 12.1 billion kWh of 
electric power of which 9.4 billion were at hydroelectric plants 
and 2.7 billion--at heat and power stations. Furthermore, the 
electric power consumption by the economy and population of the 
Kyrgyzstan republic amounted to 9.7 billion kWh, while 6 billion 
kWh were supplied to the consolidated power grid (OES) and the 
People's Republic of China. On the other hand, 3.6 billion kWh 
were received from the consolidated power grid resulting in a 
transfer balance of 2.4 billion kWh.

  The industry is switching to new economic management 
conditions in a difficult situation which is typical of the 
economy as a whole. The principal problem which complicates 
execution of the campaign is the objective need for periodically 
increasing the electric and heat power rates. The difficult user 
adaptation to the new pricing policy and their financial 
insolvency and a lack of a clearly defined economic and legal 
framework for governing the relations among the producers and 
consumers of energy cause instability in the electric power 
industry performance. 
  The principal factors which determine the trends, scale, and 
pace of the electric power system development are as follows: 
  availability of the energy resources converted to electric 
and thermal power; 
  meeting the economy's requirements for electric and thermal 
power for domestic need and export; and 
  financing and physical base support of capital construction 
and overhaul of electric power industry installations. 
  Hydroelectric power resources are the backbone for 
developing 
the electric power base of Kyrgyzstan. According to geological 
survey data, the total hydroelectric power potential of rivers 
in the Kyrgyzstan republic reaches 142.5 billion kWh.

  According to analyses by the Gidroproyekt Hydroelectric 
Power 
Plant Design Institute, a total of 95 hydroelectric power plants 
with a total capacity of 11,350 MW and an average multiyear 
generation of 49.8 billion kWh may be built on Kyrgyzstan rivers. 
  At today's development stage, only 9% of 
hydroelectric 
resources have been mastered. Hydroelectric power construction 
is carried out primarily on the Naryn River. The development of 
the electric power industry in the foreseeable future is 
associated with mastering this river and its tributaries. 
  The plans for the power utilization of Kyrgyzstan rivers 
have 
been developed in sufficient detail, and today, there are 
several versions of hydroelectric power construction with 
economic and technical feasibility. 
  A positive feature characterizing the development of 
hydroelectric power in Kyrgyzstan is the possibility of building 
hydroelectric power plant cascades which utilize more fully the 
river resources and increase the degree of control. 
  An optimization of the electric power plant development and 
siting made it possible to determine the most efficient ways of 
commissioning the generating capacities in the power system up 
to the year 2010 (Table 2). 
  After completion of the Lower Naryn hydroelectric power 
plant 
cascade, plans call for building five hydroelectric power plant 
cascades in the upper and midsections of the Naryn River and its 
tributaries which include 19 hydroelectric power plants with a 
5,400-MW power and a 16.8 billion kWh generation in 2010. 
  Construction of the GES-2 Kambartin hydroelectric power 
plant 
with a 360-MW capacity and 1.1 billion kWh/yr generation began 
in 1991. At the same time, preliminary work and construction of 
the Kambartin GES-1 hydroelectric power plant with a planned 
1,900-MW power and an annual electric power output of 4.5 
billion kWh have begun; it will be fully commissioned by 2005. 
Construction and commissioning of the Kambartin GES-3 
hydroelectric power plant with a planned power of 170 MW would 
be expedient in 1996-2005. Kambartin hydroelectric power plants 
will operate in a power mode since the availability of the 
Toktogul reservoir downstream frees them from any irrigation 
constraints. 
  Plans for 2001-2010 call for building the Ala-Bukin 
hydroelectric power plant with a 600-MW design power in the 
midsection of the Naryn River and the Kara-Bulun plant with a 
120-MW power in 2006-2010. 
  Preparatory work on the Upper Naryn hydroelectric power 
plant 
cascade will begin in 1993 while construction of the principal 
structures--in 1995 with subsequent commissioning of five 
hydroelectric power plants in the cascade before 2005 with a 
total power of 291 MW. 
  The republic's small hydroelectric power plants could make a 
significant contribution to electric power generation. The total 
hydroelectric power potential of small rivers with rates of flow 
between 0.7 and 50 m[.sup]3[/]/s is estimated as 7.0 billion 
kWh/yr. Its utilization will make it possible to supply electric 
power to installations in distant pastures and for highland 
agriculture. 
  Today, only 3% of the possible hydroelectric 
resources of 
small rivers have been utilized in the republic. The irrigation 
reservoir and numerous canal and river resources are not being 
utilized for generating electric power. In order to accelerate 
the development of small-scale hydroelectric industry in the 
republic, plans call for building new and rebuilding small 
hydroelectric power plants with a total power of 178 MW and 
annual production of approximately 0.5 billion kWh.

  The above electric power plant development strategy will 
enable Kyrgyzstan to become a large producer of electric power 
at the turn of the century. 
  Moreover, electric power generation and the electric power 
plant capacity will double and reach 25.6 billion kWh and 7,800 
MW, respectively. 
  Gas-fired 720-MW TETs-2 heat and power generating plants 
will 
be constructed in Bishkek before 2010 in order to meet the 
demand for thermal and electric power, and first phase 
generating capacities--a peak load boiler--will be commissioned 
prior to 1994. The first generating unit with a 180-MW power 
will be commissioned in 1997. 
  Given the proposed electric power production and 
distribution 
scope, subsequent electric power supply system development for 
meeting the electric power requirements will become an important 
link in the power system. 
  The development of 220-500 kV electric networks will be 
dictated by the need to enhance electric power supply to the 
developing industrial centers, agricultural facilities, and 
municipal and domestic users in the need to accommodate 
generating capacities of the new large power plants. 
  The principal network installations to be built during 
1995-2010 include a 500-kV transmission line with the following 
500-kV substations (PS): the Kambartin hydroelectric power plant 
with the Kemin substation, the Kambartin hydroelectric power 
plant with the Kyrgyz substation in Osh oblast, and the Frunze 
substation with the Kemin substation which are used both to 
distribution power from the Kambartin hydroelectric power plants 
and for enhancing the links between the southern and northern 
parts of the power system. 
  The scope of the network construction and overhaul up to the 
year 2010 allowing that the planned hydroelectric power plants 
will generate power are summarized in Table 4. 
  The electric power distribution in the republic during 
1992-2010 will continue to utilize the formula 110/35/10-6/0.4 
and 110/10-6/0.4 kV. 
  Electrification is regarded as one of the objectives and an 
important means of implementing Kyrgyzstan's new energy policy. 
  The primary goal of its subsequent accelerated development 
is 
to maximize participation in standardizing and then subsequently 
greater improving the living conditions of the population. This 
will call for expanding the use of electric power in everyday 
life and the sphere of social services. 
  The second objective of accelerating the development of 
electrification is to enhance its participation in increasing 
the production sphere efficiency and increasing the national 
economic resources which result in invigorating the republic's 
economy. 
  It is expected that industrial electric power consumption 
will continue to decrease in 1993-1994; in addition to the 
declining volume of electric power generation, a continuing 
increase in the electric power cost which stimulates an increase 
in the electric power consumption efficiency will also have 
their impact. The economy is expected to pick up eventually, and 
some of it will be due to an increase in the electric 
power-to-worker ratio which will lead to an increase in electric 
power consumption. Nevertheless, a rather moderate rate of 
industrial electric power consumption growth is predicted 
allowing for energy conservation. Furthermore, the proportion of 
industry in the total electric power demand will decrease from 
37.2% in 1992 to 29% in 2005. 
  Roughly the same trends will characterize the electric power 
consumption for agricultural needs. At the level of 2,000, this 
category of users will consume one-fifth of the total electric 
power demand in the republic. 
  The anticipated substantial shifts in the electric power 
consumption structure will occur due to a deliberate accelerated 
development of electrification of the daily life of the 
population by implementing energy-intensive heating appliances 
in residences. A stage-by-stage increase in the number of such 
heating appliances will be responsible for an increase in the 
proportion of domestic thermal processes in the total electric 
power consumption of up to 20-30% after 2000. At the same 
time, 
the electric power consumption for traditional household needs 
will also increase. This electric power consumption is 
tentatively estimated as 11.8 billion kWh in 1995 and 17.4 
billion kWh in 2000.
