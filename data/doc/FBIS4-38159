  [Text] The Russian ambassador to Jordan has described as 
very constructive Jordan's role in Middle East peacemaking. Mr. 
Aleksandr Saltanov said the Jordanian role will contribute to 
pushing forward the peace process in the region. 
  In an interview with the Jordan News Agency, he said Jordan, 
under the wise leadership of his majesty the king, plays a 
central role in the peace process. The Russian envoy said the 
progress on the Jordanian-Israeli track and the talks cannot be 
regarded as a separate peace deal. 
  He said this achievement should be accompanied by progress 
on 
other tracks as well. The Russian ambassador explained that 
when the whole peace process began back in Madrid in 1991, it 
was clear that unilateral tracks were not the same as regards 
the depth of problems, and so, he said, it is natural that 
progress on each track depends on what problems it faces. 
  And speaking on Jordan's water rights, Mr. Saltanov stressed 
that the water issue is one of the most complicated problems in 
the Middle East. And he went on to say that solving the water 
resources problem and making sure that each party attains its 
own water rights should have priority in negotiations between 
Arab parties and Israel.
