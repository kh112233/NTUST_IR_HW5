  [Text] Beijing, June 3 (AFP)--Police detained a team of 
three journalists from the U.S. television network CBS near 
Beijing's Tiananmen Square on Friday and held them for two 
hours, one of the journalists said. 
  The American journalists and their Chinese driver were taken 
to a police station for an identity check and questioning after 
filming on the square ahead of the fifth anniversary of the June 
4, 1989 crushing of the pro-democracy movement. 
  All their videotape was confiscated, the journalist told 
AFP, 
adding that police had accused the CBS team of working without 
authorization and having filmed the heavy security deployments 
on the square. 
  Fearing incidents commemorating the massacre, the government 
has stepped up police surveillance around the Chinese capital.
