THE WORLD 
France complained to the United States about an incident at Miami International 
Airport involving a French diplomatic pouch that American customs officials 
believe may have contained narcotics, the State Department said. The French 
Foreign Ministry said U.S. customs agents held a French courier for nine hours 
after sniffer dogs and X-rays led them to believe his diplomatic pouch 
contained cocaine. French consular officials came to the airport to identify 
the pouch but refused a request to open it, the State Department said. French 
officials said the pouch was then flown to France for examination by 
anti-narcotics police but that no drugs were found.
