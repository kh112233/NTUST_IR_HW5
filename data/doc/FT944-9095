FT  17 NOV 94 / Australia extends offshore zone
Australia doubled in size yesterday, as it formally claimed massive new
offshore territory under an international 'law of the sea' convention. The
1982 United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, which was finally
ratified this year, aims to divide about 35 per cent of the world's oceans
among over 100 countries. In Australia's case it means that the country can
claim an exclusive economic zone extending 200 nautical miles from its
baselines, instead of the traditional 12 miles.
Because of the nation's extensive coastline it is now claiming around 5.7m
sq miles of ocean water, of which 4.2m sq miles derives from the new
extended nautical limits. As a result, Australia can boast one of the
largest 'exclusive economic zones' in the world.
While much of the additional territory is undisputed, there is disagreement
with Indonesia over territory around Christmas Island and off the north
coast of Australia, including the resource-rich Timor Gap.
