FT  02 SEP 92 / Royal Navy in Hong Kong patrol
Hong Kong has mustered Royal Navy ships to protect the colony's waters from
incursions by Chinese security forces after raids on two Vietnam-bound
ships, according to Mr Ian Strachan, acting security secretary, Reuter
reports from Hong Kong. The move follows two incidents at the weekend where
Vietnam-bound ships were stopped and boarded by Chinese security forces in
Hong Kong waters.
