  [Text] At a news conference held after the "Monju" 
plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor reached criticality, 
Ishiwata Takao, president of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation [Donen], disclosed that Donen is 
studying the possibility of building a "recycle experiment 
reactor" as an experiment and research reactor to replace the 
"Monju." This will allow Japan to technically handle issues of 
nuclear nonproliferation as well as environmental problems. The 
idea under consideration by Donen is that a fast breeder reactor 
and a spent-fuel reprocessing plant are constructed to 
simultaneously burn ultra-uranium elements mixed in with spent 
fuel and plutonium. This idea would remove concerns about the 
extraction of pure plutonium and its conversion into nuclear 
weapons.
