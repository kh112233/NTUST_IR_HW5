  [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- Investment in China's 
tourism industry has a larger proportion of foreign investment 
than any other of the country's industries, according to a 
senior official of the State Tourism Administration. 
  By the end of this April, foreign investment in China's 
restaurants, tourism transport, construction of tourist spots, 
and tourist entertainment facilities totaled more than 10 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  About 53 percent of total input in China's tourism industry 
comes from foreign investors. In addition, tourist projects 
which are to be financed through foreign investment under 
government plans will further increase this ratio to 72.9 
percent of the total investment in China's tourism. 
  So far, according to the official, the State Planning 
Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade 
and the State Tourism Administration have jointly approved 88 
projects of construction and reconstruction of hotels with 
25,600 guest-rooms, which drew a total foreign investment of 
1.88 billion U.S. dollars. 
  With the introduction of foreign funds, the official noted, 
China has greatly improved its tourist services and further 
expanded the accommodation designed for overseas visitors. 
  At present, China has more than 3,000 hotels specially aimed 
at visitors from other countries, which receive an annual 
average of 40 million overseas tourists.
