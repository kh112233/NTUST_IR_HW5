FT  26 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Heathrow's health
Heathrow Airport insists there was no risk to the travelling public as a
result of a baggage handler contracting legionnaires' disease.
Low levels of the bacteria which causes the disease were discovered in a
crew restroom at Terminal 4 after KLM employee Chris Chittenden was taken
seriously ill three weeks ago.
Tests were carried out throughout the Heathrow site, but no action was taken
to warn travellers.
An airport spokesman denied there had been a risk to the public.
''It was an isolated incident. It was not detected in any area except a
staff area, so it was determined that there was no risk to passengers and no
need to inform them,' he said.
''We decontaminated the areas and as soon as we were satisfied, and the
Health and Safety Executive were satisfied, it was business as usual.''
A KLM spokeswoman said the rest area was out of bounds to the travelling
public. Its water supply had now been reconnected after decontamination.
