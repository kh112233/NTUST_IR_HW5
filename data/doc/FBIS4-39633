  [Text] Moscow does not see any serious problems in 
relations with Turkey. "Individual anti-Russian statements by 
Turkish representatives should be viewed as a reflection of the 
inner political game," Director of the Russian Foreign 
Ministry's 4th Asian Department Valeriy Yegoshkin told Interfax. 
  He said that the recent statement by Chief of the Turkish 
General Staff Dogan Gyuresh to the effect that Russia continued 
to pursue an imperial policy in the region must not be perceived 
as a symptom of cooling in Russian-Turkish relations. 
  Ankara officials have distanced themselves from this 
statement. General Gyuresh also asserts that he was 
misunderstood, he continued. 
  Commenting on the utilization of the resources of the 
Caspian 
Sea by all countries of the region, Yegoshkin said that the 
position of Azerbaijan created certain problems. 
  The countries of the Caspian region have equal access to the 
Caspian Sea which is not divided into territorial waters or 
economic zones, he said. 
  Yegoshkin said that Baku has a different opinion. Azerbaijan 
would like to own a large part of the Caspian Sea and attract 
foreign companies for developing the Caspian oil deposits. 
Azerbaijan's unilateral moves may damage the interests of other 
Caspian countries. Such problems must be tackled at the 
negotiating table by all the countries concerned, he said.
