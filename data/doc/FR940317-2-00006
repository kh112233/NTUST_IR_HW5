ACTION: 

Notice.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice (1) reaffirms an earlier policy statement, published on June 26, 1986, concluding that livestock and
poultry involved in biotechnology experiments are subject to current regulations relating to eligibility for slaughter
at official establishments, (2) reaffirms an earlier policy statement, published on December 27, 1991, concluding
that livestock and poultry involved in biotechnology experiments are transgenic research animals and, therefore,
are subject to existing regulations for livestock and poultry used for research, (3) advises that the Food Safety
and Inspection Service (FSIS) will inspect for human food use livestock and poultry which were involved in biotechnology
experiments, and (4) announces the availability of a document prepared by FSIS entitled ``Points to Consider for
the Evaluation of Transgenic Animals from Transgenic Animal Research'' (Points to Consider).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FSIS is responsible for ensuring the safety, wholesomeness, and accurate labeling of all meat, meat food products,
and poultry products under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), 21 U.S.C. 601 

et seq., 

and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), 21 U.S.C. 451 

et seq. 

Livestock and poultry involved in biotechnology experiments to introduce genetic improvements by transgenesis,
i.e., transgenic research animals, may be offered for slaughter for food purposes in official establishments. Agency
review and approval in accordance with 9 CFR 309.17 and 381.75 are required before these transgenic research animals
may be slaughtered for human food use at official establishments. In addition, persons who intend to slaughter transgenic
research animals or their progeny for human food use at official establishments may obtain a copy of the Points to Consider
document, and follow the voluntary guidelines set forth in that document. Persons who follow both the applicable
regulations cited above and the Points to Consider document should note that the inspector in charge (IIC) may still
deny or withdraw the approval to slaughter transgenic research animals for human food use when the IIC deems it necessary
to assure that products prepared at the official establishment are not adulterated, in accordance with the FMIA and
the PPIA. The approval to slaughter commercially produced, nonresearch transgenic animals will be handled separately
at a later date.




Currently, trangenesis is usually conducted by injecting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) into fertilized eggs to achieve
desired genetic and/or physical changes. This procedure results in only a small proportion of animals being born
with genetic changes. Animals born without genetic change may be used for human food under current policies set forth
in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) June 26, 1986, policy statement published in the 

Federal Register

 (51 FR 23336) which states that existing regulations would be applied to food animals involved in biotechnology experiments.
Also, USDA's policy for the inspection for human food use of livestock and poultry which are involved in biotechnology
research but which are not genetically modified products of biotechnology, published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 67054) on December 27, 1991, concerns transgenic research livestock and poultry in which genetic change has
not occurred. Due to the small number of transgenic research animals produced in biotechnology experiments, such
transgenic research animals have not been presented for slaughter in the past. However, FSIS anticipates that production
of such transgenic animals will increase. This notice reaffirms USDA's June 26, 1986, and December 27, 1991, notices,
specifically with regard to animals involved in biotechnology experiments.

Because of the high level of public and Congressional interest in biotechnology, FSIS is advising in this notice the
actions it will take to ensure that meat, meat food products, and poultry products derived from livestock and poultry
involved in biotechnology experiments are safe, wholesome, and accurately labeled. This document also provides
guidance to those using biotechnology to produce genetic changes in livestock and poultry and offering the same for
slaughter at official establishments.
