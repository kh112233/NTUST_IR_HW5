FT  20 JUL 94 / Dollars 820m aid pledge for Uganda
International aid donors have pledged Dollars 820m to help support economic
reforms in Uganda during 1994/1995, the World Bank said, Reuter reports from
Paris.
The aid, in the form of grants and highly concessionary loans, was far
higher than the minimum Dollars 515m estimated as needed, and reflected
donors' appreciation of Uganda's economic reforms, a Bank official said.
Uganda, suffering from a heavy debt burden and lower prices for its main
export, coffee, has been moving towards a more market based economy.
The pledges include Dollars 470m in project aid, Dollars 297m in import
support and Dollars 53m to help multilateral debt servicing, civil service
reform and further army demobilisation. More than half the funds will come
from multilateral institutions. Last year international aid donors pledged
Dollars 815m in aid to Uganda.
