CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION UP TO 29,473,400 
California's population grew last year by a record 772,400, fueled by the 
highest net migration total since World War II, state population experts said 
Friday. 
The state's estimated population, according to the Demographic Research Unit of 
the Department of Finance, hit 29,473,400 on Jan. 1, 1990. 
That was a 2.7% increase in a year. 
California's growth included a record number of births, minus deaths, of 
333,990, plus net migration of 438,410. The net migration estimate is the 
highest since 1943-44, when it was 523,000. 
San Francisco was the only county to lose population, dropping for the third 
straight year. The current population, 727,000, is 2,900 lower than the year 
before. 
Riverside County was the fastest growing county in the state, increasing 8.3%, 
to 1,110,000, followed by Del Norte, 7.8%, and Amador, 7.1%. The latter two 
counties had large increases in state prison populations. 
Several counties hit population milestones during 1989. For instance, 
Sacramento County exceeded 1 million, at 1,026,800, and San Diego County passed 
the 2.5-million mark, at 2,509,900 in adding 92,300 residents. 
Los Angeles County added 117,100 people, to reach 8,769,900; Orange County 
added 46,800 to reach 2,326,200; Ventura grew by 12,800 to reach 668,600 and 
San Bernardino added 88,400 to reach 1,423,800. 
Among cities, Los Angeles and San Diego posted the biggest total growth 
numbers. Los Angeles added 34,600 people for an estimated population of 
3,434,000. San Diego has 30,500 more people for a population of 1,118,000.
