  [Text] The Federal Government has issued its last word on 
the Bad Kleinen antiterrorism operation. The final report to 
the Bundestag, which is already available to ZDF, confirms that 
suspected Red Army Faction terrorist Wolfgang Grahms committed 
suicide. However, it is noted that the authorities involved 
made considerable mistakes during the arrest operation. As one 
of the consequences, the GSG-9 antiterrorism unit is to 
cooperate more frequently with the laender's special task forces 
in the future.
