METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
ADULT TRIAL ORDERED FOR GIRL IN SLAYING 
A 17-year-old girl was ordered Monday to be prosecuted as an adult on charges 
that she and her gang member boyfriend shot a police officer to death last 
September. 
Compton Juvenile Court Judge Rose Hom found that Raylene Brooks, 17, was 
unsuitable to be prosecuted as a juvenile. The district attorney's office will 
refile the case against her in Municipal Court. 
If convicted as an adult, Brooks could face life in prison. Her boyfriend, 
Kirkton P. Moore, 27, faces a possible death sentence if convicted at his 
pending trial. 
The two are charged with killing Los Angeles Police Officer Daniel Pratt after 
a drive-by shooting in Southwest Los Angeles on Sept. 3. 
They fled Los Angeles after the shooting but surrendered to a Los Angeles 
television reporter in Las Vegas following an Oct. 23 broadcast of a segment 
about the case on the TV series "America's Most Wanted."
