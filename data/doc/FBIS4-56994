  [Text] In what according to his own words constitutes an 
historic moment of great importance, Commander in Chief Fidel 
Castro is already in Pretoria to attend Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration as president. A few minutes after 1300 in Cuba -- 
1900 in South Africa -- the plane carrying Fidel and his 
delegation landed at Jan Smuts International Airport, 
Johannesburg, the first stop in South Africa. 
  We traveled approximately 45 km by road to Pretoria where 
workers are putting the finishing touches on the site of the 
ceremony that will end the apartheid regime by placing Mandela 
at the nation's helm. Mandela received an absolute majority of 
the votes in the first multiracial elections ever held in South 
Africa. 
  At the Arcadia Hotel where the Cuban delegation headed by 
Fidel is staying, numerous requests for interviews and contacts 
have been received from heads of states and journalists here to 
attend the inauguration. We can therefore assume that Fidel will 
be extremely busy after the inauguration. Among those who have 
asked to meet with Fidel are South African television, the PLO, 
and the heads of state of Sudan and Nigeria. 
  Before leaving Ghana for South Africa, Fidel spoke with the 
reporters accompanying him and discussed his presence at the 
inauguration of the African National Congress's leader. 
  [Begin recording] [Bel] How do you feel about going to the 
inauguration ceremony? 
  [Castro] I feel very good in every sense of the word. I am 
in 
great health. I slept well and am very happy to be on my way to 
the inauguration. 
  [Bel] What does attending Mandela's inauguration mean to 
you? 
  [Castro] It represents an opportunity to participate in an 
historic event such as this, which the peoples of Africa and the 
world are experiencing. 
  [Bel] Thank you. 
  [Castro] And also, we cannot waste a single minute, so we 
get 
there on time. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What can you tell us about your 
meeting with Rawlings? 
  [Castro] I am very pleased, although it was very brief 
because he too had to get going. I am very pleased to have 
stopped here and to have contacted the people of Ghana. [end

  The inauguration ceremony will take place in the [words 
indistinct] a place near the Arcadia Hotel. At 1100, the new 
national flag will be hoisted and the inauguration ceremony will 
begin.
