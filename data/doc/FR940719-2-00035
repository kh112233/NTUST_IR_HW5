Approval of Federal Information Processing Standards Publication 186, Digital Signature Standard (DSS)



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Commerce.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of approval of Federal Information Processing Standard 186, Digital Signature Standard.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This notice announces that the Secretary of Commerce has approved the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) as Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 186. The DSS provides the capability to generate digital signatures that
cannot be forged. This capability is needed by Federal government agencies to carry out their responsibilities for
electronic exchanges and to improve government operations through the use of information technology.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE: 

This standard is effective December 1, 1994.

<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES: 

Interested parties may purchase copies of this standard, including the technical specifications section, from
the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). Specific ordering information from NTIS for this standard is
set out in the ``Where to Obtain Copies'' Section of the announcement section of the standard.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

On August 30, 1991, NIST published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 42980) a notice which announced the proposed FIPS for DSS. On December 2, 1991, the comment period for the proposed
FIPS for DSS was extended by notice published in the 

Federal Register

 (56 FR 61231).



NIST received comments from 109 organizations and individuals in response to the 

Federal Register

 notice and to information sent to Federal agencies on the proposed FIPS for DSS. Many of the comments supported the
proposed DSS and stated requirements for a digital signature capability for use in electronic data applications.
Other comments in support of the DSS backed NIST's goal of a digital signature standard that is free of patent impediments
and that provides for interoperability and a uniform level of security.

NIST also received many comments criticizing the adoption of the proposed DSS. Some of the arguments in opposition
included: The selection process for the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) was not public; time provided for analysis
of the DSA was not sufficient; the DSA may infringe on other patents; the DSA does not provide for secret key distribution;
the DSA is incomplete because no hash algorithm is specified; the DSA is not compatible with international standards;
the DSA is not secure; the DSA is not efficient.

NIST considered all of the issues raised and believes that is has addressed them. The development of this standard
was carried out through NIST's usual procedures including solicitation of input from different sources. To provide
more time for analysis of the DSA, NIST extended the original three month review and comment period for an additional
three months. NIST has addressed the possible patent infringement claims, and has concluded that there are no valid
claims.

The DSA does not provide for secret key distribution since it is not intended for that purpose. Since the proposed DSS
was announced, a Secure Hash Standard was proposed and approved as FIPS 180. With respect to the compatibility of the
DSS with international standards, NIST has proposed that the DSA be an alternative signature standard within the
appropriate international standard (IS 9796). Concerning the security of the DSA, no cryptographic shortcut attacks
on the DSA have been discovered. However, NIST has revised the proposed standard to provide a larger modulus size.
This modification will accommodate requirements for long term security of digital signatures. NIST believes that
the efficiency of the DSA is adequate for most applications.
Given the complexity of the public comments, NIST proceeded deliberatively in its consideration of the August 1991
proposal. The written comments submitted by interested parties and other available material were carefully reviewed
and considered in the determination to finalize the proposed FIPS for DSS. On the basis of this review, NIST recommended
that the Secretary approve the standard as a Federal Information Processing Standards Publication, and prepared
a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation. The detailed justification
document which was presented to the Secretary is part of the public record and is available for inspection and copying
in the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th
Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues, NW., Washington, DC 20230.

This FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability,
implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical
requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section is provided in this notice.
