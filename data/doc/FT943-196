FT  30 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Damaging programmes will remain a
problem
Sir, The trouble with the chancellor Kenneth Clarke's otherwise excellent
proposal to use International Monetary Fund gold to reduce third-world debt
is that it leaves damaging structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) intact
('Clarke proposes IMF gold sale to help poor nations', September 26). Nor
may sales of 10 per cent of the IMF's gold be quite enough.
At least the chancellor's proposal is a recognition that multilateral debt,
owed to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, is itself a
problem. But his initiative requires an expansion of the enhanced structural
adjustment facility (ESAF).
The experience of Christian Aid and other agencies is that structural
adjustment (promoted by ESAF) is damaging the poorest people in
debt-burdened developing countries. Not for nothing are SAPs said to stand
for 'Suffering African People'. For the poor, SAPs mean cuts in spending on
schools, health centres and on government jobs. Currency devaluation forces
up the prices of everything from imported medicines to bus fares, which
depend on imported fuel.
Ten per cent of the IMF's gold will be needed to wipe out the debts to the
IMF of Africa alone. If the price of reducing debts is even more structural
adjustment, it may be a price the poor are unable to pay.
