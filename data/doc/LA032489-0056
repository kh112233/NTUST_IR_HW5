THAILAND HONORS 165 SLAIN SECURITY MEN 
King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit presided over a mass cremation 
Thursday of 165 soldiers, police and defense volunteers killed in Thailand 
border defense and anti-insurgency incidents last year. The victims included 
116 soldiers, 40 defense volunteers, six policemen, two navy personnel and one 
civilian volunteer, military-run television reported. 
In the annual rite, the king lighted a ceremonial flame during the cremation of 
the 163 Buddhists at a temple on the outskirts of Bangkok. The two Muslims were 
honored in a ceremony in the south, where there are large Muslim populations.
