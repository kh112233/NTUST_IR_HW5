  [Text] A third safe house belonging to Basque Fatherland 
and Liberty [ETA] has been found by the police in Barcelona. 
There were neither arms nor explosives in the apartment, 
because it was used as a hiding place for the members of the 
commando acting in Barcelona. 
  Meanwhile, in Zaragoza this evening bomb disposal experts of 
the security forces set off a car bomb. Over to our studios in 
Zaragoza, Manuel Segura, good evening. 
  Segura: Good evening. Toward 1745 bomb disposal 
experts belonging to the police force blew up a suspicious car 
parked near the crossing of the streets Escoriaza y Fabra and 
Santander in Zaragoza, near the Portillo railway station. 
  The car was a white Renault 5 with Barcelona number plate 
6095 MD. Police believe that it might be the car in which two 
women were seen with Felipe San Epifanio, alias Pipe, head of 
ETA's Barcelona commando. [see "Selected Video Reports" section
