FT  11 FEB 94 / Observer: Ruffled feathers
The embattled wind power industry has decided that offence may be its best
defence.
This month's issue of Windpower Monthly, the industry journal, has on the
cover a grisly picture showing a man holding a dead bird by its battered
feathers. In the background are several wind turbines.
The scene is Tarifa in southern Spain, where Europe's largest wind farm with
269 turbines has been accused of slicing up migratory birds. A long article
inside contains the disturbing admission by Francisco Serrano, director of
Spain's renewables energy agency IDAE, that there was 'a very unfortunate
lapse of memory' at the planning stage. 'Nobody thought about migratory
birds. Only the resident fauna was taken into consideration,' he says.
The article also describes how the European Commission has warned Spain to
review its wind-farm policy until a long-term bird study is completed. The
edition has led to howls in some corners of the wind-power industry because
it may only stoke further hostility towards wind farms. But Lyn Harrison,
who edits it from Denmark, tells readers: 'There is method in our madness.'
Better to air the problem in a wind energy magazine where it is more likely
to get balanced treatment than in other media. 'The situation should never
have arisen, and the industry ought to be kicking itself.'
