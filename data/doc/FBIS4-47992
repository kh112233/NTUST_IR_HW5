  [Excerpts] President Nelson Mandela will from Tuesday be 
eligible to draw a basic, taxable annual salary of R575,000 
[rand], a special government committee on politicians salaries 
has decided. 
  With a car allowance of R115,000 added, as well as a free 
house worth, for tax purposes, R94,350 a year, his remuneration 
package adds up to R784,350. 
  This works out at R65,362.50 a month, although his takehome 
pay will amount to R34,136 after tax and other deductions. 
  Mandela agreed to the salary package this week in 
consultation with the outgoing Cabinet, said committee chairman 
Mr Justice D Melamet. 
  He will be the first president of South Africa to be taxed 
on 
his salary, the judge said in Pretoria yesterday. [passage

  Net annual salaries (after deductions including tax) for 
deputy presidents amount to R338,247, while premiers and Cabinet 
Ministers will get R298,043, deputy Ministers R240,876, National 
Assembly members R137,001 and legislature members R132,121. A 
perk would be two free air tickets a month. [passage omitted]
