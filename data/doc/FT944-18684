FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Complaint filed on Nepal dam -
Madrid Conferences Digest
A first complaint has been filed to the World Bank's newly established panel
set up to investigate complaints from people adversely affected by Bank
projects. A group of non-government organisations from Nepal has charged
that the Arun III hydroelectric dam project is in violation of the Bank's
policies and procedures. They said the high cost of the project could result
in cuts in health and social services programmes, while construction of a
122km road to the dam site would have adverse environmental effects.
