  [Text] Lima, 29 Mar (EFE) -- General Nicolas Hermoza, chief 
of the High Command of the Peruvian Armed Forces, today reported 
that the price of cocaine base has fallen abruptly following 
recent security service actions against the trafficking gangs. 
  Hermoza stated that the price of washed cocaine base has 
fallen during the past few weeks from $1,500 to $150 per kilo. 
He presented 23 traffickers to the media who were captured in 
the jungle department of Madre de Dios while dispatching 1,051 
kg of cocaine to Colombia. 
  Hermoza also showed assets seized from the traffickers, 
including electricity generators, precursors to manufacture 
cocaine base, communications equipment, and vehicles. 
  The traffickers were captured during several operations last 
week in the province of Inapari, Madre de Dios department, on 
the border with Brazil, where a drug collection center operated. 
  Hermoza indicated that the cocaine paste, which was to have 
been processed into cocaine hydrochloride in Colombia, had 
arrived from the Huallaga valleys and from the Ucayali River 
area. 
  The military commander said: "The capture of these 
traffickers and their equipment is proof that land and air 
actions in the Huallaga and Ucayali areas has caused the 
trafficking axis to be moved from there to Madre de Dios 
department." 
  Security forces seized 3,653 kg of basic paste and captured 
13 traffickers on 24 February in Boca Manu, also in Madre de 
Dios department, in the largest drug seizure ever in this Andean 
country. 
  Peru produces some 2,000 tons of basic paste per annum that 
is exported mainly to Colombia, where the Cali and Medellin 
"cartels" process it into the pure cocaine that is sold in the 
United States and Europe. 
  Two thirds of all cocaine consumed in the world is processed 
from the basic paste that comes from Peru.
