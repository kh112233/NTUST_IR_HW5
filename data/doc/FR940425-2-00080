rubella vaccines and combined tetanus and diphtheria toxoids; (2) plans, coordinates, participates in, and collaborates
on research to determine the most effective means of encouraging the use of vaccines targeted for adults; (3) collaborates
with private sector partners in the development and implementation of adult immunization strategies; (4) conducts
demonstration projects to assess the feasibility of various vaccine delivery systems and determine the most cost-effective
means of reaching the adult population with the designated vaccines; (5) evaluates the effectiveness of relevant
vaccine-preventable disease activities and cost-effectiveness of relevant vaccines; (6) prepares information
and statements for appropriate advisory committees pertaining to adult immunization; (7) prepares and reviews
