  [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella said yesterday that 
the U.S. Government is willing to initiate -- during the second 
half of this year -- talks with Argentina on its participation 
in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) comprising 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
  The foreign minister indicated that during a meeting in 
Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told him 
about "the willingness for an opening and that countries which 
have implemented economic reforms take precedence." 
  Di Tella stressed that the United States has sold the 
Skyhawk 
fighter planes to Argentina, despite British opposition, because 
"it has admitted that our country is a reliable country, even 
from a military viewpoint." He encouraged the United Kingdom 
"to review this new event." 
  The minister denied that the sale of Skyhawk planes 
satisfied 
the British. He pointed out that, quite the contrary, the 
British authorities "staged a stubborn and systematic opposition 
because, from a military viewpoint, Argentina did not seem to be 
reliable." 
  During an interview with Radio Mitre, Di Tella said the 
sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands "represents an issue that 
is systematically discussed" with the British. He stressed that 
before making any decision, the British should consider the 
islanders' will.
