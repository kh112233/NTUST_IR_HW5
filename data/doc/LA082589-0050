Billionaire hotelier Leona Helmsley had trouble differentiating between the tax 
status of her husband's real estate empire and the couple's $11-million estate, 
her defense lawyer said in closing arguments in Manhattan federal court. 
Helmsley, 69, is accused of billing $4 million worth of renovations at the 
couple's mansion in Connecticut as business expenses in order to evade $1 
million in taxes. Harry Helmsley, her 80-year old real estate magnate husband, 
also was charged but was severed from the trial after a series of strokes left 
him with a loss of memory.
