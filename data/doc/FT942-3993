FT  11 JUN 94 / Property: A snip at Pounds 25m - in Chelsea - Cadogan's
Place
Yours, reader, for Pounds 25m. That is the guide price for the Old Rectory
(56 Old Church Street) in Chelsea, London SW3, now coming to market. No
other house for sale in London matches this private palace in its own garden
of more than two acres.
A 1725 building with later additions, it had been sold by the Diocese of
London for redevelopment, but this only came to fruition when the property
was bought in 1990 by developer TMC, under its Japanese chairman Norikazu
Nemoto. Anthony Collett, managing director of TMC, and Andrzej Zarycki, both
architects, prepared new plans which needed listed building consent, and
which tripled the size of the house.
A classical treat is the result. I particularly liked the tall pavilion-like
drawing room, belle epoque at its most belle. Windows down to the floor lead
into the garden and across to a columned conservatory that houses a swimming
pool that recalls the emperor Hadrian's villa near Tivoli.
Detailing is immaculate, from the parquet floors to the cedar of Lebanon in
the clothes cupboards (to deter moths and make the clothes smell nice). An
oculus-window in the gym looks into the pool. The kitchen is of burnished
steel, and the machines in the basement are a handyman's heaven. The garden
even has a borehole and irrigation.
The agent is Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629 8171). The house is for sale
leasehold, with 113 years to run, and a ground rent of Pounds 500 which
qualifies a private buyer to enfranchise the property (acquire the
freehold). Otherwise, the Old Rectory will revert to the Church of England's
London Diocesan Fund in the 22nd century.

Elsewhere in the housing market, Nationwide building society reports a
slight rise in property prices in May and Halifax a slight fall. New
mortgages were down in April from March, as were both agreed sales and
completed sales as monitored by the Corporate Estate Agents Property Index.
Yolande Barnes, of Savills Residential Research, who in December forecast a
25 per cent rise in prime central London property by the end of 1994 - and
19 per cent elsewhere - says building society figures tend to reflect the
cheaper end of the market.
In the first quarter of the year prime values rose by 5 per cent in central
London and this has rippled on to outer London and the home counties. There
are no similar increases elsewhere in the UK and some asking prices are
still coming down.

medieval undercroft from the previous Benedictine nunnery, for around Pounds
350,000 from Redmayne Arnold &amp; Harris (0223-323130).

were originally small banqueting houses - or places for a discreet
rendezvous.

Merton College, Oxford, is selling the 1,2080-acre Radstone estate near
Brackley in Northamptonshire, which it bought in 1868. Interest has been
intense. Agent Cluttons (0865-246 611), requesting best offers by June 22,
has despatched more than 400 particulars.
Estates bursar Robert Hodgson says that Merton, now more than 700 years old,
will still own 14,000 acres.
The guide prices is Pounds 2.46m. A possible bonne bouche for a churchgoing
purchaser of the estate, is the chance to receive the advowson, the right to
present the rector. As a Merton man, I hope that the best price is realised.
