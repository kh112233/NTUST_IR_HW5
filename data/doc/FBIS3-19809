  [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- Hundreds of Kurds on Tuesday [22 
March] blocked several highways in the FRG and thus caused a 
traffic jam. In Hesse, Lower Saxony, Baden-Wuerttemberg, 
Berlin, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, and Bremen, 
Kurds blocked highways and caused traffic to come to a 
standstill. 
  Several dozen Kurds blocked the highway near Giessen and 
Frankfurt around noon. According to the traffic news, a similar 
action took place on the Frankfurt-Darmstadt highway. On the 
highway at the former Dreilinden checkpoint near Berlin, 
approximately 60 demonstrators set fire to car tires. The 
traffic came to a standstill in both directions. In the area of 
Cologne, traffic jams of several kilometers formed after 
blockades. More than 200 Kurds obstructed the traffic on the A 
27 highway in Bremen and the A 7 highway near Northeim (Lower 
Saxony). According to the police in Breman, gasoline was 
spilled on the road. 
  The most violent clashes with Kurds since the ban of the 
Workers Party of Kurdistan, PKK, four months ago had taken place 
only on the weekend. Up to 6,000 Kurds occupied the 
Munich-Stuttgart highway for nine hours on Saturday. On Monday 
evening, several thousand Kurds demonstrated in German cities on 
the occasion of the Kurdish spring festival "Nevruz."
