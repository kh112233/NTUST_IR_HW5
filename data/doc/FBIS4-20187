  [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin is in New York to 
attend the meetings of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Contact Group with the UN secretary general 
and the Security Council. 
  Today, Cetin first had a working breakfast with the foreign 
ministers of Pakistan, Tunisia, Iran, Malaysia, Senegal, and 
Egypt, members of the ICO Contact Group. He is now attending a 
meeting being held at the UN building with the permanent 
representatives of the ICO member countries. 
  In a statement to Turkish Radio and Television before the 
meeting, Cetin said: 
  [Begin recording] We will discuss what can be done, what the 
ICO can do, to ensure that a lasting peace is established in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will say that the most urgent step that 
can be taken unless the necessary measures are implemented as 
soon as possible is to lift the arms embargo on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We will explain that we are determined to 
make the necessary efforts to this end. We will then meet with 
the Security Council members. Then we will meet with the UN 
secretary general. In this way, the 52 members of the ICO will, 
once again, pull their weight and express their determination 
about ending the tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording] 
  After a speech at the UN Security Council late tonight, 
Foreign Minister Cetin will leave New York for Turkey.
