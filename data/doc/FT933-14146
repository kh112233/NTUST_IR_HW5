FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Genentech results show sharp
increase
GENENTECH, the US bio-technology company 60 per cent owned by Roche of
Switzerland, lifted second-quarter net income to Dollars 10.4m from Dollars
3.4m a year earlier, driven by a jump in income from product sales and
licensing.
The increase in earnings per share to 9 cents, up from 3 cents a year
earlier (though below the 12 cents of the first quarter), helped to lift the
company's shares by Dollars  1/2 to close at Dollars 44 1/4 in New York.
Sales of Activase, the heart drug which is the company's biggest-selling
product, continued to recover from the decline which had largely accounted
for a slump in the company's 1992 earnings.
Following results at the end of April from a 40,000-patient trial, sales of
Activase rose to Dollars 55.8m in the quarter, up from Dollars 49.2m in the
first three months and Dollars 44.6m in the second quarter of 1992.
Overall, product sales increased to Dollars 110.8m (Dollars 95.8m in the
second quarter of 1992).
Contract income jumped from Dollars 5.3m to Dollars 24.3, due largely to an
Dollars 18.2m contribution from a three-year licence agreement with
Schering. Total revenues were up to Dollars 169.8m, from Dollars 153m in the
first quarter and Dollars 136m in the second three months of 1992.
The company's normally high research and development spending jumped
further, to Dollars 83.9m (Dollars 73.3m), as it took a charge of Dollars
13.7m to end an agreement involving the Research Institute of Molecular
Pathology in Vienna.
The R&amp;D effort yielded two significant developments in the quarter: the
start of development work on a new heart drug and a decision by the US Food
and Drug Administration to review Genentech's cystic fibrosis treatment.
On the former, Mr Kirk Raab, chairman, said: 'If this molecule performs as
well in the clinic as it does in the laboratory, it could advance the
treatment of heart attack even further than Activase has.'
