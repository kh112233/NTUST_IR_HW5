FT  18 DEC 92 / A generation of young Africans is wasted by lack of
resources
THEY HAVE little in common except their fate.
Young pickpockets in Nairobi, street urchins in Luanda, teenage bandits in
Mogadishu, Aids orphans in Kampala, child prostitutes in Kinshasa, young
'comrade' fighters in Soweto: they are part of Africa's wasted generation,
doomed to poverty, never to realise their potential.
Disease and deprivation are killing or crippling millions of Africa's
children. Compassion alone demands a response, but Africa's planners point
to a further imperative.
The scale of the toll is so great that it is imperilling the continent's
capacity to manage its development in the decades to come.
'Today's generation of African children will be largely consigned to lives
of poor health, and arrested growth. . . the hopes of the continent will be
frustrated well into the next century,' warns a Unicef report.
'Unless urgent action is taken. . . the human foundation for Africa's
progress in the 21st century will not exist,' it says.
The odds are heavily stacked against you if you are born on a continent that
has seen a decade of decline.
Nearly 5m under-fives die each year, usually of readily preventable
diseases, estimates the Unicef study, presented at a conference in Senegal
last month, co-sponsored by the Organisation of African Unity.
If you survive these hazardous years, you then have a one in three chance of
completing primary school.
And as you enter maturity you will run a gamut of risks ranging from
exposure to Aids to becoming a teenage conscript in a rag-army.
'The point has now been reached where not only the past progress but the
present survival, protection and future physical and mental development of
Africa's children are directly threatened by a critical scarcity of
resources.'
Around Dollars 12.7bn (Pounds 8.3bn) will be needed each year for the rest
of the decade, Unicef calculates, if basic targets in health, education,
water supplies and sanitation are to be met, Unicef calculates.
Raising the funds requires a combination of reallocation of existing aid
flows by donors, external debt relief, domestic measures including tax
reforms and user charges, the report suggests.
Only Norway currently channels 20 per cent of its bilateral aid to social
priorities. If all industrialised countries did the same, funds for this
sector would rise from around Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 3.5bn.
'The tragedy is that for Africa, the 21st century is getting off on the
wrong foot,' the report warns, ending with a plea: 'The abandonment of hopes
for the continent would mean the writing off of the talents, aspirations and
potential of one eighth of mankind, both now and far into the next century.'
