METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
LESBIAN CUSTODY SUIT ADVANCES 
A Long Beach woman's lawsuit asking joint custody of a child born to her former 
lesbian lover through artificial insemination can go to trial, a judge has 
ruled. 
The suit says that a relative of 32-year-old Terri Sabol was the sperm donor 
that enabled Sabol's then-partner to conceive and on Dec. 16, 1986, give birth 
to the baby girl. But the couple subsequently broke up and the 29-year-old 
mother, who was not identified, allegedly began to limit Sabol's time with the 
child and refused to allow her to help make decisions about her. 
Attorney Gloria Allred filed suit on behalf of Sabol in Los Angeles Superior 
Court in November, 1987, seeking to establish her rights as a parent. 
The mother's attorney, Mitchell Jacobs, sought to have the suit dismissed on 
grounds that the court has no legal authority to consider such a claim. But on 
Monday, Superior Court Judge Richard E. Denner denied the motion. 
"We asked the court to recognize that this was a family, although not a 
traditional one, and that it would be unfair to deprive our client of contact 
with the child," Allred said.
