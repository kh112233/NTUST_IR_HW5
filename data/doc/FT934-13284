FT  22 OCT 93 / Technology: Early refuse catches the worm - Worth Watching
After 30 years of research, a French company has devised a way to dispose of
domestic refuse  - by getting earthworms to eat it.
The technique, developed by Sovadec, of Montelimar, involves the strict
control of temperature and humidity to ensure the maximum amount of organic
materials are ingested and broken down into worm compost.
When the rubbish arrives the refuse sacks are torn open and the material is
sorted into glass, plastic, metals and so on. The organic material is
disinfected and then passes into the 'verbicomposter' (incubator)  - the
most important element in the Naturba process. Here the worms eat the
rubbish, after which a drying process separates the compost from the
remaining refuse. Sovadec: France, 75 01 30 43.
