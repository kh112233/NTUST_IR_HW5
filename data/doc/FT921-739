FT  27 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Hotel deal knocks Lonrho
CONGLOMERATE Lonrho fell sharply as a result of mixed feelings about its
annual meeting and consideration of a hotel chain deal with Libya.
As the market opened, Lonrho gained 4 on news that it had sold a one-third
share in its Metropole Hotels (Holdings) to the Libyan Arab Foreign
Investment Company for Pounds 177.5m. The price was seen to be good and the
cash was welcomed as a counterbalance to an estimated debt of Pounds 850m.
However, as analysts considered the political implications of the deal,
particularly the prospect that any potential buyer of Lonrho might be
discouraged by the link, they took a more cautious view.
This view was compounded by murmurs of disquiet over general trading voiced
at the annual meeting. Lonrho traditionally has a very loyal body of private
shareholders behind it, but observers said the cracks were beginning to show
yesterday.
The stock slipped back in the afternoon to close a net 8 lower at 95p - one
of the biggest percentage falls in the London market - with a hefty turnover
of 10m shares.
Rank shines
Political considerations helped Rank Organisation as buyers sought the
leisure and office equipment group as a hedge to a possible Labour victory
in the UK general election next month. The shares climbed 15 to 660p in
brisk turnover of 1.1m.
Smith New Court initiated the Rank rise yesterday as it put out a strong buy
note. The broker highlighted the group's credentials of a reasonable rating
in an underperforming leisure sector that is poised to improve markedly as
the economy recovers. 'Rank has the right profile in the right sector at the
right time,' said Mr Bruce Jones.
The point highlighted by Smith and taken up by most investors, however, was
that Rank could be a key stock under a Labour administration, with its
domestic leisure side - such as bingo halls and holiday centres - largely
unaffected by the party's tax plans and economic policies. It also has a
large international exposure through its Rank Xerox subsidiary, which will
also be unmoved by a change of UK government.
Burmah pleases
Lubricants to specialist chemicals group Burmah Castrol was one of the
strongest performers in the market after announcing 1991 profits at the top
end of analysts' forecasts and a confident trading statement. The shares
jumped 41 to 523p with 2.2m traded.
The rise was accentuated because expectations had been dampened ahead of the
results announcement and analysts were pleased that profit margins had been
maintained in spite of a fall in volume. County NatWest said Burmah still
looked inexpensive. The house remains a buyer and has lifted its forecast
for this year by Pounds 1m. It has also raised its dividend forecast by a
penny to 25p.
Reflection on the prospects for TSB following the bank's annual meeting left
the shares looking weak against the market on heavy turnover of 8.2m. The
stock lost a penny to 130p.
Kleinwort Benson's banking team, which was already at the low end of
analysts' forecasts, cut its profits estimate for the year to October by
Pounds 20m to Pounds 205m. The house also shifted the stock from a buy
recommendation to a hold following recent outperformance of TSB against the
market.
Glaxo retreated 22 to 802p as the recent positive run on the shares appeared
to peter out. Talk that Glaxo formed part of a large sell programme carried
out by US brokerage house Salomon Brothers late on Wednesday also helped to
depress the stock.
Strong interim results helped Wellcome to rise 15 to 1014p. Profits were
roughly in line with market forecasts, but the meeting was bullish and
analysts liked the underlying sales growth, especially of its Zovirax herpes
drug and its anti-Aids drug Retrovir.
ICI was firm on reports that Tamoxifen, a drug used against breast cancer,
might also strengthen a woman's bones, reducing the risk of osteoporosis
that normally accompanies ageing. Tamoxifen is produced by a subsidiary of
ICI and the chemicals giant gained 16 to 1255p.
Burton Group was the most heavily traded stock in London on turnover of 15m
shares. Morgan Stanley and Cazenove were said to be involved, as blocks of
around 3m shares, including an agency cross at 40 1/2 p, changed hands. The
stock closed  1/2 higher at 40p.
Supermarkets had a firm tone following higher profits from Wm Morrison and a
strengthened buy recommendation for J. Sainsbury from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
Northern England food retailer Morrison, recently described as a rising star
by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, moved ahead 15 to 328p on announcing profits of
Pounds 62.65m, compared with Pounds 50.28m previously. The company also
proposed a two-for-one scrip issue.
Sainsbury moved forward 6 to 387p after UBS upgraded its 1992-93 profits
estimate to Pounds 725m from Pounds 706m.
News of possible trouble ahead for Rolls-Royce, the aerospace engine maker,
seeped into the market and restrained the shares, which showed no change at
154p. Trade unions, unhappy at the loss of 3,000 jobs, held a meeting at the
company's Derby factory yesterday and could ballot the workforce on
industrial action.
Figures from food processing equipment group APV came in at the lower end of
the range of City forecasts and were accompanied by a warning that current
first-half trading had been difficult. In spite of a held dividend the
shares fell 8 to 108p.
Exposure to US markets helped Siebe to put on 10 to 627p and TI 7 to 652p.
Publishers and printers were helped by 1991 profits of Pounds 85.2m from
United Newspapers. The profits were at the top end of forecasts and United
advanced 13 to 373p, with SG Warburg hardening its buy stance on the stock.
Pearson was lifted 18 to 796p and Reed International 14 to 520p.
Paper, plastics and building materials group Bunzl appreciated 4 to 90p on
6.4m shares traded after a sharp fall in 1991 profits. Analysts felt that
the company had hit rock bottom and was set for a revival of fortunes.
Slough Estates, Britain's fourth largest property group, won a generally
warm reception for its final results yesterday. The shares firmed a penny to
177p in exceptionally high volume of 3.8m.
Bass, the UK's biggest brewer, came closer to achieving the sale of 2,740
public houses that it is required to dispose of under a Department of Trade
ruling. The shares rose 8 to 536p.
