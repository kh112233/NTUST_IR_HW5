DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN DIES IN 2-CAR CRASH NEAR PALMDALE 
A Hawthorne woman was killed just outside Palmdale when her car veered across 
the median of the Antelope Valley Freeway and was struck by an oncoming car 
carrying a mother and her two children, the California Highway Patrol said 
Friday. 
Susie E. Carper, 43, who was not wearing a seat belt, died at the scene early 
Thursday, CHP Officer Scott McKnight said. The occupants of the other car 
escaped serious injury because the mother wore a seat belt and her daughters 
were in back-seat child restraints, he said. 
Nancy E. Jones, 30, of Palmdale suffered facial cuts and was taken by ambulance 
to Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, along with daughters Jillian, 18 months, 
and Jaycie, 4 months, McKnight said. All three were expected to be treated and 
released, the officer said. 
Investigators had discovered no cause for the 7:45 a.m. crash, which occurred 
in unincorporated county territory south of Palmdale. 
Carper was headed north on the freeway toward Palmdale when her car drifted 
across the freeway's gravel median area and was struck on the driver's side by 
Jones' vehicle, McKnight said. Jones saw the oncoming car and braked but could 
not avoid the collision, he said.
