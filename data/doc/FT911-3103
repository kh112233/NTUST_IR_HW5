FT  26 APR 91 / Letter: Questioning the value of aid workers' salaries
Sir, Observer neatly linked (April 22) the World Development Movement's
delight at the prime minister's 'hope' - expressed in 1983  - that Britain
would, in five years' time, achieve the aid target of 0.7 per cent of
economic output) with the news that the WDM chief would soon become 'World
Bank fat cat'.
The point is surely worth a little adornment? Since the World Bank annual
salaries will soon pass the Dollars 1bn mark and since the reported 100,000
expatriate experts in just Africa are said to be costing some Dollars 5bn a
year, Britain will have to hurry to double its aid budget just to keep a few
of the aid workers' salaries moving ahead in the time-honoured way. We can
then spare a thought as to whether their activities add a single dollar of
value to the economies in which they labour.
Many claim the value added is negative and the experts say Africa is poorer
today after 40 years of pursuing aid policies which change but little in the
face of staggering failure.
World Bank policies are now being challenged yet again on the entirely new
grounds that they actually prevent the development of the private sector,
the key to any progress.
Why do we go on and on persisting with these failed polices? Simple. Aid is
basically an international business and there are a lot of well-developed
fat cats (WDFCs?) who understandably do not want the milk taken away from
them. The developing countries would be well advised to look elsewhere for
their salvation.
