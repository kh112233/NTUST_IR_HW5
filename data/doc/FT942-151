FT  30 JUN 94 / Technology: Pill caps get smart
If people with epilepsy or severe high blood pressure forget to take their
medicine they can become very ill and land in hospital. Some people with
tuberculosis have developed new strains of the virus resistant to all known
antibiotics, simply because they forgot to take their pills.
Non-compliance, medical jargon for failing to follow doctors' prescriptions,
is a common problem. Researchers have estimated that some l0 per cent of
hospital admissions among the elderly are related to this failure. According
to some US surveys, non-compliance adds billions of dollars each year to
hospitalisation costs.
A small company called Aprex in California's Silicon Valley has come up with
a novel approach to the problem - a computer chip in the cap of a bottle
that records each time the bottle is opened. The cap looks like the face of
a digital watch, showing the time and date and telling patients how long it
has been since they last opened the bottle. In some models an alarm will
ring when it is time for a pill to be taken.
Data from the smart-bottle technology, dubbed Medication Management System
or Mems, can be transferred to doctors' computers. 'This technology offers
doctors another diagnostic tool,' says Janice Wohltmann, who heads Aprex.
'When patients aren't getting better, doctors can assess whether that is due
to non-compliance.'
Some 50 pharmaceutical companies worldwide have used Mems in clinical trials
of new medicines, to see if patients followed drug regimens. Data is fed
through the Mems system to the drug companies.
The companies are being pressed to show that their pills are cost-effective.
John Urquhart, a co-founder of Aprex, believes that smart bottles may be
just what they need to show that taking medicine on time can save money.
