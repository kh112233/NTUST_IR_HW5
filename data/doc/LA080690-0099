ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY; 
ENROLL YOUR CHILDREN EARLY, PARENTS TOLD 
School officials are urging parents to enroll children early in school, because 
getting the necessary paper work and shots may take more time than they think. 
All children who will be 5 years old on or before Dec. 2 are eligible to attend 
kindergarten, but they must have birth certificates, baptismal certificates or 
passports. 
All new students require immunizations for polio, measles, rubella, mumps, 
diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough. 
In the Saddleback Valley Unified School District, free immunizations are being 
provided by the Orange County Health Department the second Tuesday of every 
month in the multipurpose Room at Mission Viejo High School, 25025 Chrisanta 
Drive, Mission Viejo. 
Registration also is beginning at junior and senior high schools. 
In the Capistrano Unified School District, Shorecliffs Junior High and
