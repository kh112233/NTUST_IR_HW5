  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 15 (AFP) -- A 
Palestinian police officer shot dead near the Jewish settlement 
of Netzarim in the autonomous Gaza Strip was killed accidentally 
by a colleague, a senior police officer told AFP Wednesday. 
  Palestinian sources said Monday the policeman had been 
killed 
by unidentified gunmen as he patrolled close to Netzarim. 
  "From the inquiry we carried out, it appears that Khalil 
Abu-Hamzah, 23, was killed immediately by a bullet fired 
accidentally by one of his colleagues," the police chief said. 
  On Tuesday the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad accused Israeli 
settlers of having killed the officer. 
  It is the first accidental shooting of a police officer by 
his colleagues since Israeli troops redeployed in the Gaza Strip 
to hand over to the Palestinian police, following the 
Israeli-PLO self-rule accord signed on May 4. 
  Two police officers died in a car accident shortly after 
they 
arrived on the Gaza Strip on May 18.
