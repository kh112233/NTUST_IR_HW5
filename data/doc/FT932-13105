FT  24 APR 93 / Cookery: Just perfect partners - Why duck needs a contrast
but harvesting one's supper by torchlight is different. I have done it only
once, on an East Anglian farm, or to be more precise a vast hangar of a shed
standing on an island of concrete slabs set in a Constable landscape.*
Blanched chicory needs to be deprived of light. The traditional way is to
cover it with straw or forcing pots as it pushes its way through the soil.
The modern factory farm solution is to grow chicory in the darkness of a
computer-controlled hydroponic shed.
It was eerie to see the chicons in the beam of a torch as they lay, ghostly
pale and shoulder to shoulder, in their bunk-like beds. These were, in fact,
shelves stretching the length of the shed through which nutrient-bearing
waters were pumped.
In fact we could have made the inspection blindfolded. Growing progress can
be gauged largely by sound, apparently. As the plants grow their little
rootlets gradually form a thicker and thicker mat through which the water
flows, and the sound of running water changes accordingly.
Chicory grown this way lacks some of the bitterness traditionally associated
with this vegetable, bitterness which is fundamental to its character and is
part of its charm for some. This chicory was blander and fatter. Eaten
within a couple of hours of picking it was juicy and supremely crisp.
DUCK WITH CHICORY, HONEY AND LIME (serves 2) The chicory follows the duck
into the pan in this recipe, so the leaves are deliciously anointed with
duck fat and pick up meaty sediment. Maybe my servings of chicory are a
little generous.
There might be enough for four if you wanted to serve the dish for a party,
but in that case the chicory would be reduced to the role of a garnish
rather than served as vegetable proper. Chicory cooked in this way also goes
well with grilled pork chops.
For two people, you will need 10 to 12 oz of duck breast fillet, either one
large magret cut diagonally in half to make two portions, or two breasts
from a smaller bird.
As for the chicory, I suggest 10 oz prepared weight. Buy more to allow for
trimming away the solid root end and any bruised or wilted parts. Separate
each chicon into individual leaves, in so far as you can. The centres are
too tightly furled to pull apart with your fingers, so slice them thinly.
You will also need: 1 teaspoon of finely chopped ginger root, 1 tablespoon
of freshly squeezed lime juice, a sprig of mint, and a scant 2 teaspoons
runny honey. (Stand the jar in a bowl of hot water so it will be easy to
measure when you want it.)
Heat a heavy frying or saute pan and fry the duck gently. Cook it skin side
down most of the time to render the fat and to avoid toughening the flesh. A
total of 10-12 minutes gentle cooking should produce meat that is tender and
faintly pink in the centre.
When done to your liking, transfer the duck to a low oven to rest and pour
off all but 1 tablespoon of fat (save it for frying croutons or potatoes).
Away from the heat, stir the honey and lime juice into the fat remaining in
the pan.
Add the ginger and chicory and quickly place the pan over medium-low heat.
Cook, stirring and turning the leaves quite frequently, for about five
minutes until thoroughly wilted and lightly caramelised.
Carve the duck into slices and lay it on the chicory with its juices poured
over. Scatter with torn mint leaves and serve with steamed basmati rice.
