FT  20 OCT 94 / EU policies 'main threat to E Europe exports'
The trade and industrial policies of the European Union were yesterday
singled out by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
as 'the main threat to eastern European exports and investment'.
In its first 'transition report' on the shift from centrally planned to
market economies throughout the former Soviet bloc the EBRD states, 'the
main threat to eastern European exports and investment comes from actual,
threatened and 'latent' trade remedy action employed for purposes of
managing trade to support industrial policy objectives in the EU'.
It warns of the uncertainty that such policies arouse in exporters and
potential investors and adds that so-called 'voluntary export restraints'
imposed by the EU on the former communist states 'can strengthen
bureaucracies and existing exporters at the expense of new entrants'.
At the end of May 1994, some 19 anti-dumping measures imposed by the EU were
in force along with 12 other trade restrictive measures, the report shows.
'The mere threat of limited market access may generate sufficient
uncertainty so as to reduce investment in competitive sectors,' the report
adds.
The report also criticises the Europe Agreements (EA), which are bilateral
trade agreements between the EU and individual central European countries.
By setting very high local content rules the EAs 'have investment-deterring
effects' on assembly operations in Eastern Europe which use cheap but
skilled local labour to assemble finished products incorporating parts
imported from other EA countries. They also discourage greater trade between
the former Comecon states, it says.
In spite of the hurdles that the EU continues to place in front of the
economies in transition, however, the report shows how much progress has
been made over the past five years. The private sector now accounts for more
than half of all economic activity in nine of the 25 countries surveyed and,
with the exception of Ukraine, most states have managed to avoid
hyper-inflation.
Inflation is down to low double digits in most of central Europe and the
Czech Republic is first in line to bring price rises down to single figures
this year or next. Unemployment, whose rise over the past five years has
been one of the clearest indicators of the shake-out from the Soviet-style
heavy industries and arms plants, is now starting to ease off in the
fast-track reforming states.
Foreign equity investment, which totalled only Dollars 12bn until the end of
1992, remains highly concentrated on Hungary. But the Czech Republic, Poland
and other states with restructured economies and growing domestic markets
are attracting growing volumes of investment.
Set against the benefits of greater choice of goods, the end of queueing and
shortages and greater employment freedom, however, are negative social
factors such as the growth of crime, more social and job insecurity and
rapidly widening income differentials.
On the evidence garnered from the 25 highly diverse former centrally planned
economies in which the EBRD now operates, the most important elements
conducive to a successful transition have proved to be 'transparency of
government action, macro-economic stability and progress in privatisation,'
Mr Nicholas Stern, the EBRD's recently appointed new chief economist said.
Other important factors include progress in taxation reform, with the
introduction of VAT and graduated personal and corporation income taxes, and
financial market and bank reforms.
The report indicates a growing split between the group of central European
countries closest to EU markets, quickest to adopt macro-economic
stabilisation and micro-adjustment policies, and the slower, more distant
parts of the former Soviet empire where reform started later from a less
culturally prepared base.
The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, the Baltic states and
Slovenia have made most progress to date. In these countries the decline in
production which followed market reforms and the collapse of the Comecon
markets is over. Poland, the first to bite the bullet of macro-economic
stabilisation in 1990, was the first to return to growth in 1992. But all
are now in the early stages of what should be a prolonged rise in
production, investment, foreign trade and income. Official statistics, still
biased towards the declining state sector, under-record the real rates of
income and output growth, the report adds.
The EBRD identifies an intermediate group, including Kyrgysztan and Russia,
which has made 'spectacular progress' in privatisation but remains far
behind in financial sector reform and enterprise restructuring.
Beyond lie Ukraine and several other Commonwealth of Independent States
members which have been slow to embark on monetary and other essential
structural reforms and reluctant or unable to privatise. Growth here is not
likely to resume until around 1996.
