  [Text] Another NATO military inspection team under the 
U.S. flag has arrived at the Borisov tank repair plant at which 
Belarus is continuing to destroy its military armored equipment. 
The team also comprises one representative from Germany, 
France, Denmark, and Belgium. The expert team confirmed the 
completion of the preliminary stage of work envisioned by the 
international Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. A 
BELINFORM correspondent has been told at the Belarusian National 
Agency for Control and Inspections that NATO military teams 
monitoring the reduction of Belarusian military hardware will 
have paid eight or nine more visits by November 1994.
