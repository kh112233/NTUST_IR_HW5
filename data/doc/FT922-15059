FT  03 APR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Batteries stay the distance
Rechargeable batteries provide power for almost every portable gadget from
mobile telephones to notebook computers. But one drawback of nickel-cadmium
batteries is that unless they are fully discharged before recharging, they
will no longer accept a full charge.
However, Discovery Distributing, based in Canada, claims to have developed a
solution. Its Power System recharger discharges and conditions Ni-Cad
batteries before recharging them. As a result Discovery says the batteries
last longer and can be fully charged every time. The base recharging unit
comes with interchangeable tops to accommodate various Ni-Cad battery
designs. Discovery Distribution: Canada, 604 876 6710.
