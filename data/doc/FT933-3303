FT  14 SEP 93 / Directors of Seat to discuss debt plan
THE board of Volkswagen's Spanish subsidiary, Seat, will meet today in
Barcelona to discuss its financial situation, a company spokesman said.
He confirmed that Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, and Mr Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, the production director, would attend the meeting, but
would give no further details.
The meeting is expected to discuss contingency plans to reduce debts and
operating costs, including the possible transfer of Seat's Landaben plant in
Pamplona to VW and reductions in the 23,000 payroll.
Mr Piech is believed to have commissioned a special audit after receiving
reports of a looming deficit at Seat this year of DM800m (Dollars 493.8m) or
more, and requests for an urgent DM1bn cash injection to save the company
from collapse.
The subsidiary, which was taken over in 1986 and operates some of the most
modern and low-cost manufacturing sites in the group, lost DM180m last year
on sales of DM10bn.
The need for an investigation adds to the burdens of Mr Piech, who is
already weighed down by a clash with General Motors of the US over
allegations of industrial espionage.
He is also battling to restore his personal credibility, having had to back
away from earlier promises that the struggling VW automotive group would
return to profit this year.
Whatever the findings of the audit, VW appears to have little alternative
but to step in with a salvage operation.
VW lost DM1.6bn in the first half.
However the supervisory board has said it expected a positive result in the
third quarter for the German parent and the group as a whole.
