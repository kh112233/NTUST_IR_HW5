FT  01 DEC 92 / Man held over Molln attack
THE German authorities yesterday announced the arrest of a 19-year-old man
on suspicion of causing the arson attack which killed three Turkish citizens
in the northern town of Molln last week, writes Judy Dempsey in Bonn.
A woman and two girls died after a fire bomb was thrown into their home, an
incident which prompted the authorities to take a much tougher stance
against the rise of the far-right. A 25-year-old man, Mr Michael Peters, was
arrested last week on suspicion of leading a right-wing terrorist movement.
Mr Alexander von Stahl, the Federal public prosecutor, said yesterday he was
also investigating the activities of four other right-wing groups.
Officials are now acutely sensitive to international opinion and growing
criticism in the country that they reacted too slowly and too late to the
spate of attacks on foreigners over the past 18 months. They yesterday
repeated warnings that neo-Nazi groups would be stripped of their rights,
including the right to vote and stand for elections.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, also indicated that certain racist
opinions would be banned from being expressed in public.
