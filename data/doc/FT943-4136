FT  10 SEP 94 / Derailment 'unrelated to stoppage'
The two incidents, one of them a derailment, which occurred during
Thursday's one-day stoppage by signalling staff cannot be blamed on the
strike, Railtrack said yesterday.
The RMT transport union and the Aslef train drivers' union have accused
Railtrack, which runs the network, of taking chances with passengers' safety
by employing inadequately trained staff in signalboxes.
An incident at Sawley in Derbyshire when two cars passed over a level
crossing moments before an oncoming passenger train was the result of
actions by a contractor working on the line, Railtrack said.
BRIS, a British Rail maintenance subsidiary, had begun its own disciplinary
proceedings, Railtrack Midland said. 'There was no involvement by any
signalling staff,' an official said. 'Contractors were working on the
crossing and they did not follow the correct procedure.'
An initial investigation of an incident at Bickley in Kent, where several
carriages of a commuter train were derailed, also showed that the signal
workers' strike was not to blame, Railtrack South said.
A full inquiry is to be held next week but initial indications were that the
signalling equipment was being operated normally.
The full inquiry will focus on the technical operation of the points,
signals, the train's brakes and the actions of the driver, Railtrack added.
It expected repairs to the line to be completed by Monday.
