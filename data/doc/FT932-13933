FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: New drugs help SB rise 12% to Pounds 306m
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM, the Anglo-American drugs and consumer products group,
yesterday reported pre-tax profits for the first quarter to March 31 ahead
by 12 per cent from Pounds 272m to Pounds 306m, on sales 26 per cent greater
at Pounds 1.52bn, compared with Pounds 1.21bn.
The results were aided by currencies. At comparable exchange rates, sales
were up 11 per cent and pre-tax profits 10 per cent. The company said
profits were less affected by currency because of hedging policy. Earnings
per share were up 14 per cent from 6.6p to 7.5p.
Mr Bob Bauman, chief executive, said: 'We have had four years of substantial
growth. SB is on the right track for ongoing growth.
'Controlling healthcare costs is a priority, but government leaders should
understand that medicines, which account for less than 10 per cent of total
medical costs in most countries, dramatically lower costs by maintaining
health and limiting the need for far more expensive surgery and
hospitalisation,' he said.
In Europe, pharmaceuticals sales only grew by 3 per cent. Legislation in
Italy and Germany cut sales by 15 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. In
the UK and France they rose 10 per cent and 19 per cent.
The pharmaceuticals division's turnover rose 32 per cent from Pounds 674m to
Pounds 886m while trading profits increased 14 per cent from Pounds 215m to
Pounds 245m. Performance was helped by US sales up by 25 per cent.
Drugs sales were also helped by new products which had not come on stream
fully for the same period last year.
Sales of new products were Pounds 95m, compared with Pounds 212m for all of
1992. These included Seroxat, an anti-depressant known as Paxil in the US,
Relafen, an anti-arthritic, Kytril, an anti-nausea and vomiting treatment,
and Havrix, a hepatitis A vaccine.
Sales of Augmentin, an antibiotic increased 22 per cent to Pounds 212m,
following a weak first quarter last year.
Sales of Tagamet, an anti-ulcer compound and traditionally the company's
best-selling drug, fell 22 per cent against an unusually strong first
quarter in 1992. The medicine comes off patent next month in the US, its
largest market.
Consumer brands, which include Lucazade and Ribena, generated turnover up 10
per cent from Pounds 322m to Pounds 355m, while operating profits fell 14
per cent from Pounds 43m to Pounds 37m.
The first quarter dividend is 2.533p per share and 4.896 cents per equity
unit.
