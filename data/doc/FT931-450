FT  30 MAR 93 / Letter: Encouraging clean power
Sir, Is the chancellor's budget proposal to apply a hydrocarbon fuel duty on
orimulsion intended to encourage the building of integrated gasification
combined cycle (IGCC) clean power plants in the UK?
Orimulsion is not burnt as a fuel in an IGCC power station. Orimulsion
feedstock is gasified and sulphur and other contaminants removed from the
raw gas. The resulting clean fuel gas fed to the electricity generating
section (the combined cycle) is both sulphur and hydrocarbon free and could
not be liable for the new tax. Steam and hydrogen for nearby refineries are
possible co-products. Coal is an alternative feedstock for such a plant.
