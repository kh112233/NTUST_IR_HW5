FT  11 MAR 94 / Sex bias law set for only minor changes
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, last night accepted that some changes
should be made to the Sex Discrimination Act to improve employment
opportunities for women. But he ruled out wholesale recasting of its
provisions.
While promising to have further talks with the Equal Opportunities
Commission, he told the Commons: 'I do not think we should substantially
reshape the legislation.'
Mr Hunt rejected Labour charges that during the past 15 years the government
had exploited the increase in male unemployment by encouraging the use of
part-time women workers to drive down wages.
He said women often wanted to combine work with family commitments, and had
benefited greatly from the creation of more than 2m part-time jobs during
the past 10 years.
A Labour motion calling for the sex discrimination and equal pay acts to be
strengthened and extended was defeated by a government majority of 46
(303-257).
Ms Clare Short, who speaks for Labour on women's issues, said the
overwhelming majority of women were in low-paid jobs with little opportunity
for promotion, and no pension entitlement.
She said the expansion in the number of part-time women workers had followed
the destruction of more and more full-time jobs for men, and had resulted in
the 'dragging down of standards' for everyone.
Ms Short added: 'Women do not want rotten wages, no training and no pensions
 -that is why full-time rights for part-time workers are crucial'.
She called for urgent action to implement the recent Lords' judgment that
the laws on part-time workers' rights over redundancy pay and unfair
dismissal breached European law.
Mr Hunt condemned discrimination against women as inefficient and clearly
wrong and said there was scope for a bi-partisan policy. He stressed that
only 13 per cent of women with part-time jobs would prefer to work
full-time.
