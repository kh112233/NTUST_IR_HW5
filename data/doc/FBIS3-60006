  [Text] The Mafia was directly linked to drug smuggling into 
Britain for the first time after the seizure of a quarter of a 
tonne of cocaine, worth 70 million pounds sterling, Customs men 
said tonight. 
  In a major international operation, anti-Mafia investigators 
in Rome tipped off British Customs and Excise officials about a 
plan to smuggle Colombian cocaine. 
  ``The job was the province of the police in Rome,'' a 
Customs 
and Excise spokesman said. ``We were simply asked to look out 
for the shipment.'' 
  The anti-smuggling operation started last Wednesday when 
the Colombian merchant vessel, Maipo, docked at Felixstowe in 
Suffolk. 
  Customs men were already in position and watching as a 
container with specially-adapted hiding places was unloaded at 
the dock. 
  The spokesman said: ``This was a very large haul and quite a 
coup. This is the first confirmed involvement of the mafia in 
drugs smuggling into the UK. 
  ``Normally the drugs are brought in direct without the 
involvment of third parties in other European countries.'' 
  The drugs operation involvied customs and police forces in 
Italy, England and Colombia. 
  As the British end of the operation continued, two Italians 
were arrested and 850 kilos of cocaine were seized in Sicily. 
  Italian anti-Mafia investigators said the bulk of the 
shipments were from Colombia's notorious Medellin cartel. 
  At Felixstowe, Customs officials arrested three men. Two 
appeared at Ipswich Magistrates Court today charged with drug 
smuggling and were remanded in custody. The third was released 
on police bail.
