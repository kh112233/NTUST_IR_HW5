ETHICS ISSUES STAND OUT IN RELIEF AS GENE MAPPING ADVANCES 
Science fiction has long been filled with chilling scenarios of the future in 
which evil leaders try to engineer a master race of genetically perfect human 
beings. 
The tools to accomplish such a feat are slowly moving out of the realm of 
fiction, however, as geneticists around the world struggle to identify and 
decode all of the genes contained in the human body. 
At the same time they must struggle with the ethical questions that have always 
surrounded the science of genetics, but their efforts in that area may be moot. 
Scientists at a recent conference on gene mapping frequently pointed out that, 
once they determine how a human being is made, they will have little control 
over how their discoveries are used. 
"We want to make people literate about genetic knowledge . . . there is no 
doubt that this knowledge would be very useful," said Dr. James Watson, the 
Nobel laureate who with Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA, the 
basic building block of cells. 
But Watson told the Yale University conference that, although he is "genuinely 
concerned" about how that knowledge is applied, "we cannot make policy . . . 
all we can do is educate." 
Gene mapping is one of the hottest areas of science now, and a unique 
international effort has been undertaken to locate and define all of the 
chemical instructions that create a human being, collectively known as the 
human genome. 
Researchers are working to map the position of each of the 100,000 or so genes 
contained on the body's 46 chromosomes. They must then determine the sequence 
of a four-letter code contained on the DNA of each gene, known as the genetic 
code. 
This code controls everything from hair color to some aspects of personality 
and consists of about 3.5 billion characters for the entire genome. 
Nearly 2,000 Genes Mapped 
So far researchers have mapped just under 2,000 genes. They do not expect to 
complete the arduous process for another 15 to 20 years. 
The United States has announced plans to invest more than $3 billion over the 
next 15 years in the National Institutes of Health's gene-mapping project, 
making it the largest in the world. 
France also has a well-advanced gene-mapping program. The European Community 
plans to invest $20 million over the next two years on a genome project. And 
Japan, the Soviet Union, Italy and Canada have announced plans for national 
programs. 
"It is very clear that the human genome initiative has captured the imagination 
of the world," said Norton Zinder, chairman of the advisory committee to the 
NIH's human genome program. 
The world, however, is not interested merely for the sake of improving 
knowledge. Researchers expect that once the genome is defined, medical science 
can apply the findings to the diagnosis and cure of more than 4,000 human 
diseases known to stem from gene defects. 
Doctors could predict an individual's, or even a fetus's, susceptibility to 
everything from Alzheimer's disease to cancer, and could possibly alter 
biological instructions to eliminate genetic defects. 
Issues Raised 
Consequently, gene mapping raises a host of social and ethical issues, such as 
rights to privacy raised by genetic testing, the prospects of more abortions to 
eliminate the "genetically unfit" and whether gene therapy should move from the 
treatment of a disease to the alteration of a person's genetic makeup to 
eliminate the possibility of disease. 
Many of the 700 scientists who attended the Yale conference were obviously 
concerned about ethics but also confused as to how much they should be involved 
in issues generally decided outside the laboratory. 
Victor McKusick, director of an international group called the Human Genome 
Organization (HUGO) that is trying to coordinate gene-mapping research 
worldwide, said that scientists may think they have no place in setting social 
policy, but in this area "we have to take (ethics) seriously." 
"The truth is we are going to have genetic information," he said. "We must make 
decisions on how it will be used." 
The NIH, under the auspices of Watson and Zinder, have set up a working group 
on ethical issues connected to the genome project led by Nancy Wexler, an 
associate professor of clinical neuropsychology at Columbia University and 
president of the Hereditary Disease Foundation. 
The project also plans to spend 3% to 5% of its annual budget, up to $5 
million, on ethical concerns and public education. 
Opposition to Mapping 
But gene mapping is already running into opposition. Jeremy Rifkin, president 
of the Foundation on Economic Trends and an outspoken opponent of genetic 
engineering, has organized a coalition of 70 consumer representatives including 
Ralph Nader and National Organization for Women President Molly Yard to lobby 
for the creation of a permanent congressional board to "address the issues of 
genetic discrimination, privacy and eugenics caused by the human gene-mapping 
project." 
In West Germany, the environmentally focused Greens Party is strongly opposed 
to the genome project, claiming that the research could lead to human eugenic 
experiments similar to those carried out by the Nazi regime. 
However, scientists note that the regulations imposed by individual countries 
may be meaningless for a project that is so international in scope. 
Zinder said the NIH group has been approached by several Third World nations 
interested in sharing research efforts and results. "I don't know that we can 
do anything about how they will use it," he said. "We can only provide the 
information."
