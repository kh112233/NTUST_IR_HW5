FRANCE EXPELS 3 S. AFRICAN ENVOYS 
France expelled three South African diplomats today for contacts between Ulster 
Protestants and the South African Embassy over negotiations to sell stolen 
parts of Britain's Blowpipe missile, the Foreign Ministry said. 
The Quai d'Orsay said the three were being expelled "because of activities 
incompatible with their status" -- diplomatic language for spying. The 
diplomats were not identified.
