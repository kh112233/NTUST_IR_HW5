  [Text] Moscow, al-Sayf [June] 8 (JANA) -- Russia commended 
the execution of the decision of the International Court of 
Justice regarding Aozou between the Great Jamahiriyah and Chad. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the 
implementation of the ruling will open up a new era for Africa. 
  Observors believe that the wide international commending of 
the stance of the Great Jamahiriyah which responds to all 
international conventions and decisions did not come out of 
vacuum but it showed the firm and principled commitment which 
became clear through the way the Great Jamahiriyah dealt with 
some issues between herself and other countries including the 
continental shelf case with sisterly Tunisia and the republic of 
Malta and recently with Chad through the implementation of the 
ruling of the International Court of Justice regarding Aozou.
