VOTER APATHY 
As a long-time Democrat and a person who has donated hundreds of hours and 
dollars to the Democratic Party, I think that voter apathy stems primarily from 
the feeling that voters don't understand the effect of public policy as 
enunciated by the candidates for public office and as reflected in the 
initiatives. I believe that candidates for public office are for the most part 
very fine public servants and as good as or better than the general public as 
far as ethics and morality are concerned. 
Certainly, the TV ads distort the positions of candidates and initiatives. TV 
stations should follow up the ad with an analysis of the truth of the 
allegation and promote public understanding of rather complex issues. The 
voters have to be taught that they have a responsibility to develop good 
government by the example they make in their everyday lives. 
The problem with government is not the politicians but we the people who have 
been taught that life is nothing but a bowl of cherries. It will be the 
well-to-do and their selfish interests that will destroy this nation, not the 
poor, as so often alleged.
