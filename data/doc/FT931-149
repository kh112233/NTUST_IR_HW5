FT  31 MAR 93 / Zeneca set for rights issue as part of ICI demerger:
Pharmaceutical business to enter international arena with New York Stock
Exchange listing
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer currently
working towards a demerger of its Zeneca pharmaceutical business, has set
the timetable for the deal which includes a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue by
Zeneca.
Although ICI and Zeneca stress that the priority in the rights issue is that
it should be a normal domestic issue - preserving pre-emption rights and
raising capital for Zeneca on suitable terms - they are also believed to be
keen to take the opportunity to put Zeneca into the international arena.
Only about 5 per cent of ICI's shares are held in the US.
Zeneca will go for a New York Stock Exchange listing and will register the
rights in the US so that investors there can take them up.
Between the issue of the pathfinder prospectus and the pricing on May 12,
Zeneca will be marketing the issue to its leading institutional investors.
After that there will be roadshows in Europe and the US to raise the profile
of the new company with large international investors.
Mr John Mayo, the former corporate financier who is to be Zeneca's finance
director, said: 'We do not have an ambitious target of transforming the
share register overnight. The medium-term strategy is to have a share
register which reflects the international nature of the business.'
This marketing effort could lead to a scheme to 'recycle' the rights shares.
A syndicate could be formed to find buyers outside the existing share
register to mop up any loose stock in the market after dealings start on
June 1.
Similar 'recycling' arrangements have been added to rights issues by other
companies, such as Time Warner, the US publishing and entertainment group.
Typically they involve a dealer-manager buying rights shares in the market
to satisfy demand drummed up by a syndicate of brokers, who are then paid a
success fee.
Although the inclusion of such an element would not drive the pricing of the
issue, it could enable Zeneca to achieve a better price if underwriters knew
that there would be a concerted effort to find buyers for any unwanted
shares during the rights period.
Normally shares issued in a rights and not taken up by investors are placed
at the end of the rights period.
Zeneca has signed a deal with Amersham International, the UK health science
group, to co-promote Amersham's Metastron, a radiopharmaceutical treatment
for the relief of bone pain associated with prostatic cancer, writes Paul
Abrahams.
Zeneca will promote Metastron, which had sales last year of Pounds 2m, to
oncologists in all markets except Japan.
It has been launched in 10 markets, including Germany and the UK, but is
awaiting approval in the US. Amersham continues responsibility for
registration.
Dr Alistair Riddell, Amersham group marketing manager, said: 'We do not have
the funds or resources to drive this product. This constitutes a
considerable step forward.'
