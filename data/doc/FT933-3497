FT  14 SEP 93 / Somalis in clash with UN force
UN troops fought Somali gunmen in Mogadishu for nearly three hours
yesterday, and three US soldiers were wounded, AP reports from Mogadishu.
Mr David Stockwell, UN spokesman, denied a report of 12 American deaths,
adding: 'We don't really have an idea of the size of the militia that
attacked us.'
A spokesman for Gen Mohamed Farrah Aideed, the fugitive warlord, said as
many as 60 Somalis may have died, including civilians caught in crossfire.
