FT  21 MAY 93 / Cuban mystery epidemic 'unique' says US expert
A US VIRUS expert helping Cuban doctors to track down the cause of a mystery
nerve disease affecting thousands of Cubans said the epidemic was unique in
his experience.
'After half a day here it's evident that this is a unique epidemic. It's not
like anything that I've ever heard of or seen,' Dr Carleton Gajdusek, the
winner of the 1976 Nobel prize for medicine, said in Havana late on
Wednesday.
He is a specialist in neurological diseases from the US government's
National Institutes of Health and has joined a team of international
specialists helping investigate the epidemic, which has afflicted almost
30,000 people on the Caribbean island.
The Cuban government asked for foreign assistance to deal with the illness
after local doctors had confessed to being baffled by the disease.
The Cubans had first said the disease was optic neuritis, which leads to a
loss of vision and is caused by vitamin deficiency. However, when many of
the victims were also found to be suffering from muscular disorders, the
doctors said they thought the illness was a 'neuropathic epidemic'. Many
victims are left bed-ridden and partly blind, according to Cuban doctors.
Cuban government officials have denied suggestions that the illness is the
result of poor diet and inadequate medicines. Cuba's beleaguered economy has
been suffering shortages of food and medicine. The island's problems have
worsened since a storm in March destroyed many crops.
Health officials are hoping the foreign specialists can quickly determine
the nature of the illness, so a cure can be applied. They said that their
confusion about the nature of the attack is compounded by the fact that its
symptoms are not recorded in medical literature, and that it attacks the
young, old and healthy.
Last month, some officials suggested that the illness was the result of
biological warfare by Cuba's enemies.
