  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan will submit to the 
International Court of Justice (ICJ) a statement on the use of 
nuclear arms which deletes a phrase saying the use of nuclear 
arms does not violate international law, Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa said Friday [10 June]. Kakizawa told cabinet members 
Japan will submit its statement in time for a Friday deadline. 
  The Hague-based international court called on the various 
nations concerned to submit a statement of opinion on the use of 
nuclear weapons after the World Health Organization (WHO) 
requested it to decide whether or not nuclear warfare violates 
international law in May 1993. 
  The government intended to submit a paper which says the use 
of nuclear arms does not violate international law, but decided 
to delete the phrase after strong criticism from the opposition 
parties and Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb victims. 
  Kakizawa explained to ministers that the government made the 
decision after considering deliberation on the issue in the Diet 
and because the use of nuclear arms is antihumanitarian. He 
also said he hopes the decision "will help the antinuclear 
policies of the Hata administration make progress."
