METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FORGING ARTISTS' 
WORKS 
A man accused of forging art who used to tool about Los Angeles in a white 
Rolls-Royce, a Ferrari and a Lamborghini was granted the services of a public 
defender in a Superior Court proceeding Wednesday. 
Anthony Gene Tetro, who is described by investigators as one of the nation's 
most prolific art forgers, pleaded not guilty to one count of grand theft and 
67 counts that he faked reproductions of the works of artists Marc Chagall, 
Joan Miro, Norman Rockwell and Hiro Yamagata. 
He is accused of conspiring with art dealer Mark Henry Sawicki, 32, of Agoura 
to defraud other art dealers by selling them fake Yamagata watercolors and 
lithographs of other artists' works. 
Tetro, who had previously been represented by private attorney George Porter, 
was granted a public defender after an application describing his present 
financial status was reviewed by the court. Tetro may be assessed the cost of 
representation, a spokesman for the public defender's office said.
