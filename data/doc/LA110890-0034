A Los Angeles police officer shot and killed a suspected armed robber who 
police said had pointed a gun at the officer from the cover of a large bush, 
authorities said. 
The suspect was believed to be an accomplice of two other men suspected of 
robbing a man after he withdrew money from an automated teller machine about 
12:30 a.m. Wednesday, Lt. William Hall said. 
After the robbery in the 400 block of North La Brea Avenue, police found three 
men who matched the description of the robbers. One of the three escaped into a 
residential area. 
Officer Salvador Apodaca, 35, a 15-year department veteran, and his police dog

The man aimed a handgun at the officer and Apodaca fired twice, hitting the man 
once in the right eye and killing him, authorities said. 
The two other robbery suspects were arrested.
