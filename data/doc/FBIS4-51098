  [Text] Changchun, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The population growth 
rate has dropped in north-east China's Jilin Province over the 
past few years, thanks to family planning and development of the 
rural economy. 
  According to a local birth control official, the natural 
growth rate has now dropped to 8.9 per thousand, from 12.93 per 
thousand in 1990, with a negative growth in some areas. 
  The official said that since the 1970s, the number of women 
in the province of child-bearing age has averaged 300,000 per 
year, and birth-control workers have provided them with various 
birth control services. 
  They have also helped families to become more prosperous. 
The provincial family planning departments have provided 50,000 
items of farm technology and given priority in government loans 
to families with only one child. 
  A system of family planning insurance has been set up in 
some 
counties.
