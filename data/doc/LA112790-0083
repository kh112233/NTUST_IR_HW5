VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD; 
CLAIM FILED OVER POLICE DOG ATTACK 
A claim for damages filed last week against the city of Oxnard is the third 
time in as many years that the city has faced a legal battle stemming from 
alleged biting incidents involving a police dog named Max. 
Anthony Orlando Mack, 30, said in a claim filed last week that he was mauled by 
Max on May 26 when police went to his house on the 2000 block of Sanford Street 
to respond to a reported domestic dispute. 
The claim, a legal move required before a lawsuit can be filed against the 
city, does not say how much money Mack wants in compensation. But his lawyer, 
Gary C. Faucette, said Mack spent 10 days in the hospital and continues to 
receive medical treatment for the bites he suffered on his arm. 
Faucette said Mack's arm is disfigured by the "major ripping and tearing" he 
suffered. The claim also alleges that during the incident, police used racially 
derogatory language against Mack, who is black. 
Police officials declined to comment on the claim, in which Mack acknowledged 
that he was involved in a dispute with his two sisters but said he never posed 
a threat to the dog or police officers. 
Last month, a Superior Court jury awarded $58,840 to the family of a boy who 
was attacked by Max, a 90-pound malinois, in 1988. An attorney for the city 
said the city was responsible for the attack on Wesley Eaton, now 5, but argued 
that the damage to the boy and his family was minimal. 
In September, Aaron Person, 23, filed a $5,000 claim against the city, alleging 
that he was attacked by Max when police arrested him for resisting arrest. HUGO
