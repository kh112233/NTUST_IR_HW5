  [Text] Bangkok, April 29 (XINHUA) -- China joined today the 
Association of Tin Producing Countries, becoming the eighth 
member of the organization. 
  On behalf of the Chinese Government, Chinese ambassador to 
Thailand, Jin Guihua, signed the "agreement establishing the 
Association of Tin Producing Countries" at the Foreign Ministry 
of Thailand, the depository country of the document. 
  Chinese Embassy sources said that China had laid three pre- 
conditions for joining the tin body, which had been accepted by 
the association. 
  As China's tin production is mainly for its domestic market, 
its export is only secondary. China will report its tin exports 
to the association on a quarterly basis. 
  China will pay its membership dues in proportion to its 
actual exports. 
  China shall not be invited to join the tin research body of 
the association. 
  Other members of the association, which was founded in 1983, 
are Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Zaire.
