FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew promises fresh effort for
talks on Ulster
SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, last night pledged to
explore all avenues that might be fruitful in an attempt to restart talks on
constitutional change in the province.
Sir Patrick told the Commons he was keen to assist in reopening a political
dialogue and build on the advances made in talks over the last two years.
But he acknowledged: 'Regrettably a lot more progress must yet be made
before direct rule will no longer be needed in the interests of all the
people of Northern Ireland.'
There were issues that required 'further, private consideration' between the
British government, the Irish government and Northern Ireland parties.
Sir Patrick was introducing the Northern Ireland Act (Interim Period
Extension) Order, which extends direct rule for another year.
Mr Kevin McNamara, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said he was moving
away from a 'neutral agenda' towards an internal settlement.
He said: 'It's now time for both the British and Irish governments to
reinvigorate and deepen their co-operation within the Anglo-Irish Agreement.
The two governments should seek to make whatever progress is possible and
seek ways to share responsibility and ensure the needs of the people of
Northern Ireland are met.
'If the parties themselves are not able to meet together and talk together .
. there is increasing responsibility on both governments to sit down and
resolve their differences.'
Earlier, Sir Patrick underlined the government's resolve to defeat
terrorism. There were 75 murders by terrorists in Northern Ireland last year
and 33 so far this year, he said.
