FT  13 APR 93 / Welsh wind farm project completed
THE BIGGEST wind farm outside the US (left) has been completed at Llandinam,
Powys. The 103 turbines will generate 31MW - enough power for 20,000 homes.
Partners in the project have released no details of the cost but it is
thought about Pounds 25m has been spent to complete the project - only 12
months since winning planning permission.
The wind farm was built jointly by Tomen, a Japanese trading house, EcoGen,
a UK company formed in 1990 to bring together a number of interests working
on commercial wind power, and SeaWest, a US company. Last month
ScottishPower announced it was also helping to finance and to operate the
wind farm.
Operation of the wind farm is covered by two NFFO (non fossil fuel
obligation) contracts by which the government requires electricity supply
companies to acquire some of their power from specified renewable sources
such as wind, water and waste products.
