FT  07 DEC 92 / Germans agree to stiffen asylum law
GERMAN government and opposition leaders agreed yesterday on how to tighten
the country's liberal asylum law to curb the influx of foreigners, agencies
report from Bonn.
The parties thrashed out an accord in the wake of a rash of violent attacks
on foreigners and amid concern at the rise of radical right and neo-Nazi
groups exploiting the issue.
The agreement coincided with a demonstration by more than 300,000 Germans
with candles and lanterns in the streets of Munich protesting against racist
attacks on foreigners by right-wing gangs. Similar vigils took place in more
than 60 Bavarian towns.
Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union (CDU), announced agreement on tightening the
asylum law at a joint news conference with opposition leaders.
He said the constitution would continue to guarantee the right of anyone to
apply for political asylum.
But asylum-seekers who crossed into Germany via another member nation of the
European Community or through a 'safe' third country such as Poland would be
immediately sent back to that country if it appeared they came for economic
rather than political reasons.
Asylum-seekers who arrived directly from countries where there was no
political persecution would also not qualify for refuge. It will be up to
the Bundestag to agree on a list of such countries.
The procedure for deciding on asylum cases would be drastically speeded up,
Mr Schauble said.
The governing three-party coalition and the opposition Social Democratic
Party (SPD) have had deep differences on the asylum issue. But SPD support
is needed if the constitution is to be amended to tighten the existing
guarantee of asylum.
The SPD made a big policy switch at a conference last month by deciding to
seek ways to tighten the law.
