FT  14 MAY 94 / Zambia seeks to cancel debt
Zambia hopes to cancel Dollars 900m of external debt owed to commercial
banks through a buy-back scheme financed by the World Bank and bilateral
donors, Mr Derek Musonda, director of loans and investment at the Zambian
Finance Ministry, said yesterday. Because Zambia's debt paper is traded at a
deep discount in the secondary markets, Mr Musonda said a Dollars 45m grant
put together by the donor community would purchase debt with a nominal value
of Dollars 900m (including Dollars 500m of arrears). 'Our intention is to
buy back our entire commercial bank debt stock totalling Dollars 1bn,' Mr
Musonda said. 'This will reduce our total foreign debt to Dollars 5.9bn.'
The buy-back will alleviate Zambia's debt-servicing burden, which currently
consumes 40 per cent of the country's export earnings. If the former
socialist country manages to stick to its structural adjustment programme,
Mr Musonda said Zambia hoped to ask the Paris Club of creditor nations to
write off much of the country's bilateral debts next year. Zambia owes the
Paris Club about half of the outstanding Dollars 5.9bn; the remainder is
owed to institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,
which do not allow rescheduling or debt forgiveness.
