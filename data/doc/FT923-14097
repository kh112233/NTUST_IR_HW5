FT  09 JUL 92 / East Anglia leads lifestyle league
EAST ANGLIA appears to be the place for young families to live, with the
lowest crime and unemployment rates in the UK and also some of the best
childcare provision.
You'd certainly be better off in East Anglia than in the north of England,
according to the latest edition of Regional Trends, the annual digest of
statistics on the UK's 11 regions published today by the Central Statistical
Office.
The north is clearly no place to bring up the bairns: one in 50 youngsters
has tangled with the law by the age of 13. They leave school at 16 in
greater numbers than in the rest of the country, with some of the lowest
grades in GCSE French. Also the north has the highest burglary rate in the
UK.
Given the region's high unemployment levels - second only to Northern
Ireland - the surprise is that so many in the north have joined the
share-owning democracy. Only the south-east has a higher proportion of
adults owning shares.
Indeed, careful study of the statistics packed into this 27th edition of
Regional Trends offers ammunition for any prejudices against people from
other parts of the country:
The heaviest drinkers are found in the Yorkshire and Humberside region.
People in the north-west spend most on booze and fags.
est population driving the oldest cars. The morose Scots have the highest
male suicide rate in the country.
In spite of the suicidal tendencies of the locals, Scotland seems a pretty
close runner to East Anglia in the quality-of-life stakes. It has the
best-staffed schools and the highest proportion of children staying on after
16. Earnings are also the highest outside the south-east.
As for the people in East Anglia, they are more likely to own a car than
others - and also less likely to fail a breath test. Some people have all
the luck.
