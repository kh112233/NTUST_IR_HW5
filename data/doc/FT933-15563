FT  08 JUL 93 / Renewable power resources studied
BETWEEN 6 per cent and 12 per cent of electricity in the south-west could
come from renewable energy sources such as wind, waste incineration and
tidal power by the end of the century, according to a study sponsored by the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The study was jointly funded with South Western Electricity, which opened
the UK's first wind farm last year.
The DTI has set a national target of 1500MW of electricity from renewable
sources by 2000.
