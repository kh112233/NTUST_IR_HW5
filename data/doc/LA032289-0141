RESEDA MAN KILLED PLAYING CHICKEN 
A man who was struck and killed by a train in Reseda was apparently playing 
chicken on the railroad tracks and waited too long to jump to safety, Los 
Angeles police said today. 
Mark Anthony Brown, 22, of Reseda was fatally injured about 10 p.m. Tuesday on 
the Southern Pacific tracks north of Roscoe Boulevard near White Oak Avenue, 
police said. Police ruled the death accidental. Detective Sandra Palmer said 
Brown, who may have been intoxicated, was standing on the tracks and apparently 
tried to jump away from the tracks to safety as the train went by. He managed 
to jump clear of the tracks but was hit by a handrail on the side of the train 
and knocked into a ditch, where he was found dead.
