FT  11 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Folly of wind power policy
Sir, Future generations will look back on hilltop wind power stations as one
of the tragic follies of the 1990s.
Tragic because, on this crowded island, hills are the last of our extensive,
undeveloped places. Millions of us love and use the hills because they
restore our spirits and our vitality.
A folly because even the latest, 350ft high turbines only generate
electricity equivalent to that used by 170 people.
Yet the unreliable nature of the wind means that not one existing power
station can be demolished, or even switched off, because instant back-up has
to be maintained.
Parliament in its now typical rush into new, half-cocked, ill-considered
regulations has distorted the market and produced a situation where
speculators can make a fortune while hypocritically wearing the mask of
environmental rectitude.
Each turbine costs about Pounds 150,000 and will go on to earn its developer
Pounds 170,000 a year. Of this income nearly Pounds 120,000 is clear profit
and is enabled by a compulsory levy on all our electricity bills - from rich
and poor alike.
Are there any MPs with the influence and foresight to lead a change in this
misguided policy?
