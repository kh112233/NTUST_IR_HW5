FT  09 NOV 93 / Turnout low in Jordan elections
THE PEOPLE of Jordan voted yesterday in the kingdom's first multi-party
elections since 1956. A total of 534 candidates, including three women and
more than 15 political parties, were standing for the 80-member Lower House
of Parliament which along with the Senate, whose members are appointed by
the king, forms Jordan's national legislature.
Government officials reported a lower-than-expected turnout. Results are
expected today.
Moslem fundamentalists are tipped to take the largest bloc of seats in the
new parliament as they did in the 1989 elections. The Islamic Action Front
is the biggest and best-organised party. It has 36 candidates standing in 16
out of 20 voting districts and has conducted its campaign on the slogan:
'Islam, the solution'. Most other parties from Communists to Nationalists
have preferred to field candidates as individuals rather than on ideologies.
The outcome of the elections has important implications on the Middle East
peace process since the new parliament, which constitutionally has a term of
four years, may be asked to ratify a future peace agreement between Jordan
and Israel.
The fundamentalists are unlikely to win enough seats to threaten
ratification, but their rejectionist stance is a cause of concern to the
king. In the last parliament, their opposition to the peace process helped
bring down the government of Mr Taher Masri.
