  [Text] Beniamino Andreatta, Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
Italy, which holds CSCE presidency at present, told a press 
conference on Friday [11 March], that at his talks with Estonian 
leaders during his two-day visit to Estonia he discussed mainly 
the problems of minorities living in Estonia. 
  Andreatta said that the CSCE does not reproach Estonia as 
far 
as legislature regulating the problems of minorities living in 
Estonia is concerned, the application of this legislation is 
what causes problems. He stated that we should not as much talk 
of nationalities as of citizenship and expressed his opinion 
that all aliens living in Estonia should have a right to a 
residence permit and foreigners' passport. 
  Andreatta had also a meeting with Estonian President Lennart 
Meri last night where he said that the CSCE activities will in 
the future, as at present, be directed towards finding 
constructive solutions to problems of Estonian-Russian 
relations. Italy as a EU member state was interested in 
economic and political cooperation with Estonia, he added.
