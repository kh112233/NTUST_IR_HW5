 

(b) Vessel owners must report all lethal incidental takes of marine mammals by contacting the nearest National Marine
Fisheries Service office, in person, by phone, or by letter, within 10 days of return from the fishing trip during which
the incidental take occurred. The report must include information on: The fishery, fishing effort, gear type and
fish species involved; the marine mammal species (or description of the animal(s), if species is not known), number,
date, and location of all lethal incidental takes of marine mammals; a description of any incidental lethal takes
(i.e., efforts to deter animals to protect gear, catch, or human life); and any loss of fish or gear caused by marine
mammals. 
(c) Any marine mammal incidentally taken must be immediately returned to the sea with a minimum of further injury and
may be retained only if authorized by an observer, by the Assistant Administrator, or by a scientific research permit
that is in the possession of the operator. 
(d) Vessel owners and crew members may intentionally take marine mammals to protect catch, gear or person during the
course of commercial fishing operations, by a means and in a manner not expected to cause death or injury to a marine
mammal. 
(e) If the infliction of the damage to gear, catch or person is substantial and immediate and only after all non-injurious
methods authorized by paragraph (d) of this section have been taken, a vessel owner or crew member may intentionally
injure or kill a marine mammal to protect gear, catch or person; except that it is prohibited for a vessel owner or crew
member to intentionally lethally take any Steller sea lion, any Alaskan sea otter, any cetacean, any depleted species
(including the Pribilof Island population of North Pacific fur seal), or any endangered or threatened marine mammal.

(f) The willful discard of any fishing gear, in whole or in part, is prohibited. 


229.8 

Emergency and special regulations. 


(a) 

Emergency regulations.

 If the Assistant Administrator finds that the incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is having an immediate
and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal population, or in the case of Steller sea lions and North Pacific
fur seals, that more than 1,350 and 50, respectively, will be incidentally killed during a calendar year in all fisheries
combined, the Assistant Administrator will issue emergency regulations to prevent, to the maximum extent practicable,
any further taking. Any such regulations: 
(1) Will be issued only after consultation with Regional Fishery Management Councils, state fishery agencies and
treaty Indian tribal governments, where appropriate, and will, to the maximum extent practicable, avoid interfering
with existing Regional, state or tribal fishery management plans; 
(2) Will take into account the economics of the fishery and the availability of existing technology to minimize incidental
taking to the extent that elimination of the adverse effects on the marine mammal population will allow; 
(3) May take effect immediately upon publication in the 

Federal Register

 and will remain in effect for no more than 180 days or until the end of the fishing season, whichever is earlier; and 
(4) Will be terminated by notice in the 

Federal Register

 at an earlier date if the Assistant Administrator determines that the reasons for the emergency regulations no longer
exist. 
(b) 

Special regulations or conditions.

 (1) If the Assistant Administrator finds that the incidental taking of marine mammals in a fishery is not having an
immediate and significant adverse impact on a marine mammal population, but that it will likely have a significant
adverse impact over a period of time longer than one year, the Assistant Administrator will request Regional Fishery
Management Councils, state fisheries agencies or treaty Indian tribal governments, where appropriate, to initiate
or take action to minimize such impact. 
(2) If the Councils, states or tribes do not take appropriate action in a reasonable period of time, the Assistant Administrator
will issue special regulations or impose special conditions on Exemption Certificates to mitigate the adverse impacts.
