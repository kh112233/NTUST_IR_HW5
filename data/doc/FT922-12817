FT  15 APR 92 / Half of America turns to the apathy party: The decline in
voter participation in the US, especially among blacks
WHILE some US voters have shown how disgruntled they are with their
political leaders this year by voting them out of office, more have joined
the other half who do not vote at all.
Last week, in New York state's apparently vigorously contested Democratic
primary, fewer than 1m people troubled to register their preference between
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, former Governor Jerry Brown of California
and the phantom candidate, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts  - a
38 per cent fall from the turnout in 1988.
Except for New Hampshire, which held the first primary, turnout has declined
uniformly this year. Only around 9.4m Democratic voters have turned out in
primaries so far this year, compared with 11.8m at the same stage of the
1988 presidential campaign.
But if voter participation has declined overall, in the black population it
has plummeted: down 40 per cent in Georgia, for example, and down 61 per
cent in Louisiana.
Some of the low turnout, both in general and among black voters in
particular, can be attributed to voters' dissatisfaction with the way in
which candidates are addressing the issues that most concern them, say
activists working for greater voter participation.
'What we have seen so far is candidates of both parties speaking to the
so-called forgotten middle class but not couching their language in such a
way as to appeal to black voters,' says Ms Sonia Jarvis, executive director
of the National Coalition on Black Voter Participation.
Another factor has been the attempt by many states, especially in the south,
to maximise their electoral clout by grouping their primaries.
With seven states voting on March 3 and another 11 on March 10, so-called
'Super Tuesday', candidates had to spread their resources thinly and were
unable to whip up much enthusiasm among voters who barely knew their names,
far less their faces or their policies.
But low turnout also reflects both structural barriers to voting and a
long-term trend of declining participation. Unlike other industrialised
countries, the US requires its citizens to jump through several hoops to
register to vote.
Many states, for example, require voters to appear in person at the
registrar's office  - which may be open only during weekday office hours.
Even those that allow citizens to register by post sometime require
notarised proof of identity.
'There is a notion that voting is really a privilege rather than a
fundamental right, and people have to prove themselves worthy by taking the
initiative,' says Mr Ed Brown, director of the Voter Education Project  - an
Atlanta-based organisation which took the lead in breaking down the barriers
raised against black voters in the south in the 1960s, but which closed its
doors last month for lack of money.
The charitable foundations which used to fund its work have turned to other
causes. Some, more politically aligned, became disillusioned in the 1980s as
voter registration drives bore more fruit for the Republicans than for the
Democratic party. Those that remain interested in voter participation have
turned to legislative efforts to make registration easier.
Ms Jarvis says that registration rules in most states were drawn up either
after the Civil War or at the turn of the century at a time of heavy
immigration from central Europe, and were always intended to discriminate.
While blacks are no longer made to construe Greek or count the bubbles in a
bar of soap  - traditional tests used to prevent them from registering in
the old south  - the barriers of inconvenience affect the generally
lower-income black population disproportionately.
'If you're poor and black and live in rural Mississippi and work in a
catfish processing plant, no one is going to give you time off to go to
register to vote,' Mr Brown says.
But Mr Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, warns that there is a long-term trend of declining electoral
participation that reflects voters' disillusionment with the political
process.
Changes in the law to allow citizens to register to vote at the polling
booth on election day might add another 6m or 7m voters to the 91.6m who
voted in the last presidential election, he says, but would not reverse the
trend.
'A lot of the declining participation has to do with the erosion of the will
to vote,' he says.
Reduced black participation is likely to be particularly damaging to the
Democratic candidate in the presidential election in November. Although the
black vote has become much less monolithic than in the recent past, some 75
to 85 per cent are still likely to vote Democratic.
It is not a matter of whether the Democratic candidate garners the black
vote, says Mr Brown, it is a question of how much.
'The view is that blacks have nowhere else to go but blacks always have
somewhere to go: they can go fishing.'
