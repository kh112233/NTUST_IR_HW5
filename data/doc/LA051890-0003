LUJAN AND SQUIRRELS 
There they go again. The environmentalists have placed another animal on the 
endangered species list. 
It is called the red squirrel. I wonder how much longer it will be before the 
mosquitoes, flies, ants and cockroaches are on their list. It seems like the 
environmentalist won't be satisfied until the animals and insects are in 
complete control and we are all out of work.
