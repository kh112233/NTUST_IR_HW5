SOVIET OFFICIALS FACE GRILLING BY PARLIAMENT 
Government ministers today for the first time faced a public parliamentary 
grilling on topics ranging from chronic food shortages to a foiled scheme to 
sell tanks abroad. 
The appearance of the ministers before the Supreme Soviet marked another step 
toward making appointed officials subordinate to the elected legislature, as 
envisaged in the perestroika program of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
Previously, ministers had faced organized questioning only once, at their 
confirmation hearings last summer. 
Most of the heat fell on economic ministers who were asked to explain why an 
economic revival plan adopted three months ago has failed to produce tangible 
results. 
Vladilen Nikitin, first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers, said the 
growth in the rate of food production shrank more than 50% between 1988 and 
1989. 
"Moving up the introduction of regulated market relations is the only way out 
of a very difficult situation," Tass quoted him as saying. 
Igor Byelousov, chief of the Soviet military-industrial complex, was grilled 
about a scheme to illegally export a dozen Soviet tanks to the West. The plan 
was uncovered and foiled by the military. Tass said deputies wanted to know the 
responsibility of "those in high places who authorized it."
