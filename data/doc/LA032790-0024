NATION IN BRIEF;

FINAL CLAIM SETTLED IN FATAL TRAIN WRECK 
Conrail agreed to pay $5.5 million in the last of about 370 court claims 
stemming from a fiery Amtrak-Conrail train wreck that killed 16 people near 
Baltimore in 1987. 
Attorneys for Susan Schweitzer, 45, of New York, said the settlement came just 
before selection of a jury to hear the civil damage trial in Baltimore. The 
crash occurred Jan. 4, 1987, when three Conrail locomotives ran through a 
switch and into the path of an Amtrak train. Conrail engineer Ricky L. Gates 
later admitted that he and brakeman Edward Cromwell had smoked marijuana just 
before the crash.
