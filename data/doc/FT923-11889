FT  22 JUL 92 / Guerrillas call strike in Peru
PERU'S worst wave of terrorist bombings in 12 years is likely to ensure
widespread support for an 'armed strike' called for today by the Sendero
Luminoso guerrilla group, writes Sally Bowen in Lima. Messages painted on
shanty-town walls are warning inhabitants of Lima and key provincial cities
they risk death if they attempt to turn up for work.
President Alberto Fujimori cancelled plans to attend a presidential summit
in Madrid as Sendero intensified its six-day campaign of terror in the
capital. A policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded yesterday
while on Monday night a car bomb wrecked Lima's Institute for Liberty and
Democracy, killing at least four passers-by and a security guard.
On Thursday a 600kg car-bomb devastated part of Miraflores, an affluent
suburb in Lima. Seventeen people died.
