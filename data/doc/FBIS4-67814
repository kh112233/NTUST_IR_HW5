  [Text] Moscow April 13 ITAR-TASS -- Channel Four of British 
television is planning to screen a documentary on Wednesday that 
alleges that the Russian scientists have developed a miniature 
neutron bomb, the size of a baseball. It is developed on the 
basis of the so-called red mercury. British television has 
every right to select films for screening and advertise the 
show, but it would not be wrong to familiarize the film-makers 
and viewers with what Russian specialists and scientists think 
about it all. 
  ``It is impossible to create a neutron bomb on the basis of 
red mercury,'' Professor Sergey Yakimov, deputy director of the 
Kurchatov Institute, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  Commenting on Western media reports alleging that Russian 
scientists have made a new discovery, Professor Yakimov said 
``this does not correspond to reality, for one simple reason: 
Red mercury does not and cannot exist in nature. It is a cyanic 
acid, the formula of which can be found in school chemistry 
books. It has nothing to do with radioactive components and 
cannot be used in any branch of atomic production.'' 
  According to Yakimov, two years ago the West was put on 
tenterhooks by rumors about cold thermonuclear processes, but a 
simple scientific verification procedure revealed it was no more 
than bluff. ``I have no doubt that today's sensation is in for a 
similar end,'' he said.
