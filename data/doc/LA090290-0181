SOUVENIR HUNTER DIES AS SLAB OF BERLIN WALL FALLS 
A slab of the Berlin Wall tipped over and crushed an unidentified 14-year-old 
boy to death as he was trying to chip souvenir pieces from it, police said 
Saturday. 
"The (concrete) segment came loose and fell over on the boy like a guillotine. 
He was killed instantly," a West Berlin police spokesman said of the accident 
Friday night. 
Hundreds of people have been hammering at the wall for months to take chunks of 
it home as souvenirs. 
It was the first known death around the Wall since East Germany's democratic 
revolution in late 1989.
