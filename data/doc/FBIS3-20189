  [Text] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kurdish extremists who "abuse the right 
to hospitality and commit serious crimes" on German soil can de 
deported to Turkey without a bad conscience. He assumes that 
the deported criminals would not be tortured or killed in their 
homeland, Kinkel said after an FDP [Free Democratic Party] 
Presidium session in Berlin today. 
  In Germany consideration is currently being given to an 
agreement with Turkey on the deportation of Kurdish extremists. 
No decision has however yet been made. The Turkish Government 
has already given an assurance that German weapons would not be 
used in internal disputes with the Kurds and its party, the PKK. 
Since he became foreign minister there has only been "five or 
six cases" where the German Government has had doubts about the 
implementation of that agreement, Kinkel said.
