MORNING REPORT: ART 
And speaking of the market for Dali art: A federal grand jury indicted a 
Honolulu-based chain of art galleries and its two top officials on fraud 
charges, claiming the gallery sold fake Salvador Dali artworks during the past 
12 years. The indictment last week charged Center Art Galleries-Hawaii owner 
William Mett, 46, of Kailua, and vice president Marvin Wiseman, 44, of Waikiki, 
with 93 counts of mail, wire and securities fraud in Dali sales to 36 
customers. Assistant U.S. Attorney Les Osborne said Mett and Wiseman have 
agreed to surrender at their arraignment, probably this week. In a written 
statement Thursday, Mett said he was innocent. ALEENE MacMINN
