<F P=106> [Report by Peter Scherer: "Russians Leave Behind `Criminal </F>
Bridgehead'"] 
  [Excerpts] Frankfurt/Main -- Even after the complete 
withdrawal of the Western Group of the Red Army from Germany, 
the criminal structures built up by leading military personnel 
of the Russian Armed Forces will continue to exist. This is the 
conclusion drawn by German security authorities. 
  In an analysis of East European criminal organizations, the 
German authorities speak of "firmly established bridgeheads of 
organized crime," whose "business will continue to thrive." The 
German authorities have found that, as far as personnel and 
logistics are concerned, these structures will be preserved as a 
result of many years of criminal cooperation between members of 
the Western Group and exiled Russian and Georgian criminals. 
The criminal machinations, which are controlled by leading 
military personnel -- including numerous generals -- have 
meanwhile also become a matter of investigations in Moscow. 
Yuriy Boldyrev, the former head of the control administration 
of the Russian president, accused "leading personnel of the 
trade administration of the Western Group" of having transferred 
17 million German marks [DM] to bank accounts in the United 
States, Switzerland, and Finland. Moreover, DM48 million were 
granted in bank guarantees, without any reason, to 13 foreign 
companies. At least three enterprises that have connections 
with the Western Group used these guarantees to withdraw DM13 
million from the trade administration's clearing account without 
supplying any goods. [passage omitted] 
  One of the most important trade partners of the Western 
Group 
is an agent in Antwerp with an estimated annual turnover of DM2 
billion. Police suspect that the heads of the company are 
involved in the international narcotics business and have close 
connections with the Russian mafia in Germany and the United 
States.
