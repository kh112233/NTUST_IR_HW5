  [Text] Chad and Libya are still seeking to reach an 
agreement on Libya's withdrawal from the Aozou Strip. Delegates 
of the two countries have been meeting in Ndjamena since 4 March 
without reaching an agreement. The Libyan delegation is even 
asking for the postponement of the meeting. Lucien Mpoungui 
reports: 
  [Begin Mpoungui recording] During the discussions, the 
Chadian delegation proposed the examination and drawing up of an 
agreement on a timetable for the withdrawal of the Libyan 
Administration and Army from the Aozou Strip following the 
recent verdict of the International Court of Justice of The 
Hague, which asserts that the more than 14,000 square km of 
territory belongs to Chad. In fact, the Libyans are calling for 
the postponement of the deliberations because they consider that 
before examining the withdrawal issue, the implementation of the 
framework agreement signed in Algiers in 1991 must be completed. 
In the said agreement, the two parties essentially undertook to 
respect the verdict of the international court of justice. 
  Libya is reportedly demanding, in exchange for the return of 
the Aozou Strip to Chad, the repatriation of 500 Libyan 
prisoners in the United States. The Chadian delegation has said 
that the decision of the UN court is binding on the two parties 
and that its implementation cannot be subject to any 
precondition. Thus, despite long discussions the delegations 
stuck to their positions, whereas in the wake of the 
announcement of the Hague court, Colonel al- Qadhdhafi said the 
Chad-Libya dispute had come to an end. 
  According to last minute reports, the Ndjamena talks on the 
Aozou Strip have been postponed and no date has been announced 
for their possible resumption. [end recording]
