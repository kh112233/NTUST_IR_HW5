FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Solvay slumps to BFr5.72bn loss
in first half
SOLVAY, the Belgian chemicals group, said its BFr5.72bn (Dollars 148m)
half-year consolidated loss was mainly due to restructuring charges, a
plunge in profits in plastics and competition from cheaper European imports,
Reuter reports from Brussels.
The loss included an extraordinary charge of more than BFr3bn. This came
mainly from provisions, depreciation charges and costs linked to
restructuring operations, including the closure of two soda ash plants in
Couillet, Belgium, and Heilberonn, Germany.
In the first-half of 1992, Solvay's BFr5.88bn consolidated net profit
included an extraordinary profit of about BFr1bn.
Solvay said the first-half 1993 deficit before extraordinary items was due
mainly to heavy losses in its plastics sector which were not compensated by
earnings in its four other sectors.
'Plastics prices have collapsed. The situation is extremely difficult,' said
Mr Daniel Janssen, chairman of Solvay's executive committee, at a news
conference.
He added that these problems were due to excessive production capacity in
western Europe and cheap imports from eastern Europe.
Mr Janssen said second-half 1993 earnings should improve, particularly in
the group's troubled plastics sector. He said there would be no
extraordinary charges in the second half.
'Second-half earnings will improve but we will definitely not make a
BFr5.7bn profit to compensate for the first half loss,' Mr Janssen said.
In Solvay's peroxygens sector, the group performance in the US and
Scandinavia had not offset a slump in earnings in the other European
countries.
In the processing sector, sales and earnings were down, with earnings
particularly badly hit in industrial film production. Sales rose in the
health sector but earnings were slightly lower while Solvay's
anti-depressant Fluvoxamine was performing well.
Mr Janssen said the health sector had seen strong growth in the US.
