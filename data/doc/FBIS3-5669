  [Text] Australia has told the Tokyo conference it is to 
provide an extra $700,000 [Australian dollars] to clear land 
mines in Cambodia, bringing its total allocation for demining in 
the financial year ending next June to about $1.4 million. 
  The allocation was announced by Australia development 
cooperation minister, Gordon Bilney, who expressed concern that 
new mines were being laid by both goverment forces and the Khmer 
Rouge. He said mines were being laid without adequate recording 
of their locations. 
  Mr. Bilney said land mines threaten food production because 
they prevented about 30 percent of farmland from being used.
