 

b. 

APH(3
&rsquo;)II in animal feed. 

Calgene also considered the potential inactivation of neomycin that is used in animal feeds manufactured using cottonseed
meal and rapeseed meal obtained from transgenic plants. The transgenic tomato was not considered because only small
amounts of tomato and tomato byproducts are used in the animal feed industry. Further, neomycin is primarily used
to treat calves and swine whereas tomato byproducts, to the extent that they are used in animal feed, are primarily
used as ingredients in cattle diets (Ref. 27). 

Calgene analyzed neomycin levels both in nontransgenic medicated cottonseed and rapeseed meals and in transgenic
medicated cottonseed and rapeseed meals over a storage period of 56 days (considered a worst-case situation) and
concluded that there was no significant inactivation of neomycin. 

FDA reviewed the data submitted by Calgene and concludes that there was no significant difference with respect to
neomycin stability between medicated cottonseed and rapeseed meals prepared from transgenic cottonseed and rapeseed
containing APH(3
&rsquo;)II, and appropriate controls (Ref. 28). Therefore, the agency concludes that transgenic strains of cottonseed
and rapeseed containing APH(3
&rsquo;)II have no apparent untoward effect regarding the stability of neomycin and that the therapeutic efficacy
of neomycin in animal feed will not be affected. The agency also considers this conclusion applicable to other aminoglycoside
antibiotics, e.g., gentamicin, when orally administered.



B. The Kan

r

 Gene 



The agency also evaluated issues relevant specifically to the safety of the use of the 

kan

r

 gene in tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton. In particular, FDA evaluated the potential for horizontal transfer of the
gene and subsequent expansion of the population of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The agency evaluated whether
efficacy of oral antibiotic treatment of humans or animals could be compromised by consumption of food containing
the 

kan

r

 gene either because of the development of resistant intestinal microflora in humans and animals or because the cells
lining the intestinal lumen might become transformed. In addition, the agency considered the possible transfer
of the 

kan

r

 gene from transgenic plants to soil microorganisms and expansion of the antibiotic-resistant bacterial population.




1. Potential Transfer of the 

kan

r

 Gene to Intestinal Microorganisms and Cells Lining the Intestinal Lumen 



Calgene presented theoretical and experimental evidence to demonstrate that the potential for compromise of antibiotic
therapy by horizontal transfer of the 

kan

r

 gene to gut microorganisms or intestinal epithelial cells is not of significant concern. Calgene considered the
sources of the 

kan

r

 gene, the role digestion plays in degrading DNA, and possible DNA transfer mechanisms. 

a. 

Relevant source of the kan

r

 gene available for transformation. 

Calgene considered potential transfer of the 

kan

r

 gene only from fresh tomatoes because processing is expected to inactivate the 

kan

r

 gene in processed tomato products and in food products derived from cotton and oilseed rape. The 

kan

r

 gene is not expected to survive procedures used to process tomatoes because heating processes, such as those used
in commercial processing, can directly degrade DNA or can damage DNA by releasing cellular DNA-degrading enzymes.


The 

kan

r

 gene is also not expected to survive the process of oil production from cottonseed and rapeseed. Mechanical grinding
or flaking of oilseeds during the production of oils and meals from oilseeds is expected to liberate degradative enzymes
normally present within the cell that would degrade the 

kan

r

 gene. In addition, oil processing also includes high temperatures and solvent extractions, both of which would be
expected to inactivate the 

kan

r

 gene. Moreover, because DNA is hydrophilic, it is unlikely to fractionate into oil, which is hydrophobic, during
the extraction of oil from cottonseed and rapeseed. Therefore, intact DNA, including the 

kan

r

 gene, is not expected to survive the production of oils and animal feeds from cottonseed and rapeseed. 

b. 

Effect of digestion on the availability of the kan

r

 gene for possible transformation. 

Calgene demonstrated that most if not all of the DNA comprising the 

kan

r

 gene ingested by humans will be degraded in the stomach and upper small intestine before it reaches the lower small
intestine, cecum, and colon, and would be unavailable for potential transformation of gut microorganisms. Calgene
estimated that 99.9 percent of fresh tomato DNA would be digested to fragments smaller than 1,000 base pairs. This
estimate was based on in vitro studies that found that only 0.1 percent of DNA could be detected as fragments of 1,000
base pairs or longer after exposure to stomach-simulating fluids for 10 minutes and to intestinal-simulating fluids
for another 10 minutes. Thus most of the DNA remaining after digestion would be smaller than the 

kan

r

 gene which is about 1,000 base pairs long.
