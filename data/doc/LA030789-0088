Hundreds of impoverished Haitians seized boats over the weekend in an effort to 
get to the United States after a rumored easing of U.S. immigration policies, a 
Port-au-Prince radio station reported. The independent station Radio Metropole 
said at least five cases of piracy were reported after people tried to seize 
sailboats and small cargo ships in the harbors of Port-au-Prince, Petit Goave, 
Les Cayes and Jeremie. It said one body washed ashore after a commandeered boat 
foundered on a reef and that craft carrying 183 Haitians were stopped at sea by 
the U.S. Coast Guard.
