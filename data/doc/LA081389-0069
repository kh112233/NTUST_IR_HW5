BRITISH BOY'S SCHOOL SAYS IT'S TOO MACHO FOR GIRLS, SCRAPS COEDUCATION PROGRAM 
A British boys' school run by Roman Catholic monks has scrapped an experiment 
in admitting girls, saying its sporty regimen was too macho for them. 
Belmont Abbey School, near Hereford in western England, has become the first 
British fee-paying school to return to single-sex status after becoming 
coeducational. 
"We took the decision on educational grounds. There was no scandal, no 
pregnancies and we are not misogynists," headmaster Father Christopher Jenkins 
said.
