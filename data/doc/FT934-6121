FT  26 NOV 93 / DTI man 'forgot' Iraq reminder
A senior civil servant forgot to inform a minister that engineering company
Matrix Churchill had supplied Iraq with machine tools that were used in the
manufacture of missiles, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday.
Mr Eric Beston, the Department of Trade and Industry official formerly
responsible for export licensing, said he had been told about the project
through a secret Whitehall committee investigating Iraqi arms procurement
but had forgotten about it over the summer holidays.
This intelligence indicated that Matrix Churchill's lathes had been turned
to military use at an Iraqi factory.
Mr Beston did not mention this in a letter in September 1989 to Lord
Trefgarne, the trade minister, before the minister's meeting with Mr Paul
Henderson, the company's managing director, to decide whether four export
licences worth Pounds 6m should be granted.
In his letter to Lord Trefgarne Mr Beston said that the Foreign Office's
case for refusing the licences was neither as 'strong nor as clear cut' as
it suggested. He said the licences were for 'general purpose industrial
equipment' of a type UK companies had previously supplied to Iraq.
He bases his case on the fact that the guidelines covering exports to Iraq
had been relaxed - although not openly - after the Iran-Iraq ceasefire in
the summer of 1988. Mr Beston agreed with Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, Lord
Justice Scott's counsel, that the main purpose of the relaxation was to
allow through dual-use goods.
