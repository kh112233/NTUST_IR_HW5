  [Text] Santiago, Chile, 24 Apr (EFE) -- The Santiago 
newspaper EL MERCURIO on 24 April carries remarks by Argentine 
Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella in which he totally 
rules out the use of force to obtain sovereignty over the 
Malvinas Islands. 
  Petrella contends that "every solution based on the use of 
force sooner or later causes problems and grievances." This is 
why "the war was so bad for Argentina." 
  Petrella said the war "destroyed the domestic consensus in 
Argentina and its consequences are there for everyone to see. 
It also prompted British diplomacy to be much more cautious." 
Moreover, it caused the British and the Kelpers to mistrust 
Argentina. 
  Ruling out the use of force, Petrella notes that it is 
unethical, it does not offer any solutions, and besides "we 
value and need relations with the United Kingdom and with 
Europe, which is practically one and the same thing." 
  The deputy foreign minister hailed the lifting by United 
States and Europe of the embargo on the sale of weapons to 
Argentina. He especially regretted that Great Britain has not 
yet lifted its embargo, "because a considerable part of 
Argentine military hardware was traditionally British." 
  Petrella said Argentina does not need the oil that 
reportedly 
exists in the South Atlantic, as "it has huge reserves, while 
more and more oil fields are being discovered." Argentina 
intends, however, "to prevent the Malvinas Islands' 
administration and the United Kingdom from acting unilaterally," 
as "the legitimacy of any investment would prompt legal problems 
because it is an area under dispute."
