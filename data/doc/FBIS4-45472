  [Text] The narcotics police at Vienna's Schwechat Airport 
achieved another success in their struggle against drug-related 
crimes thanks to the good nose of one of their dogs and the 
dedication of their officers. On 9 June, police arrested a 
51-year-old Chilean at the airport who had arrived in Vienna 
from South America via Zurich. Two kg of cocaine were 
discovered in the man's suitcases. 
  The suspect also carried 20 faked $100 notes and 20 faked 
$100 travelers checks. Finally, the officers also managed to 
catch the Chilean's contact: A Spaniard, resident in Uruguay, 
who wanted to run away but was rounded up and arrested after one 
warning shot was fired. He should have taken the cocaine to 
Italy.
