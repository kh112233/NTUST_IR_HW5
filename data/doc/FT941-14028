FT  22 JAN 94 / Concrete producers again accused of contempt
Contempt of court proceedings have been issued against some of Britain's
biggest producers of ready-mixed concrete and against eight company
directors alleged to have operated price-fixing and market-sharing
agreements.
It is the second time in three years that some producers have faced contempt
proceedings involving subsidiaries.
If found guilty again, the companies could face unlimited fines and
directors could be fined or imprisoned for up to two years, according to the
Office of Fair Trading, which brought the charges.
In the latest action, nine companies are alleged to have broken court orders
and undertakings not to operate price-fixing and market-sharing agreements
in north-west England, East Anglia, the east Midlands, London and the home
counties.
They are: Hartigan Readymix of Newport Pagnell; Mixconcrete, London; Pioneer
Concrete (UK), London; Tarmac Roadstone Holdings, Wolverhampton; Willment
Ready Mix Concrete, London; and four subsidiaries of RMC, the world's
biggest concrete company - Ready Mixed Concrete (Eastern Counties), Ready
Mixed Concrete (London), Ready Mixed Concrete (North West), Ready Mixed
Concrete (Transite) of St Albans.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, alleges that the
companies had breached court orders and undertakings given to the
Restrictive Practices Court in the 1970s.
Sir Bryan said: 'We have now amassed a substantial amount of evidence to
suggest flagrant and widespread breaches of competition law. The evidence
also suggests that previous court orders banning collusion have been
ignored: the participants must now answer to the court.'
RMC said yesterday that since 1978 it had issued express instructions to
staff not to participate in any market arrangement. It said it would defend
the legal proceedings brought against its four staff.
Three years ago Ready Mixed Concrete (Thames Valley), Hartigan Ready Mixed,
50 per cent owned by building materials group Redland, and Pioneer, a
subsidiary of the Australian materials group, were fined a total of Pounds
56,000 for disobeying court orders prohibiting them from entering
market-sharing agreements in Oxfordshire. Mr Anthony Hullett, a manager at
RMC, was fined Pounds 1,200.
