FT  05 MAR 92 / Prince chides world wildlife 'PR' attitude
Britain's Prince Philip chided representatives of 114 governments at an
international wildlife conference yesterday for regarding conservation as a
'PR exercise', and argued that the illegal wildlife trade is 'just as
dangerous' as the drug trade, Robert Thomson writes from Tokyo.
The prince's speech to the triennial conference of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) came as developing
countries complained that wealthier nations are attempting to transform them
into fauna parks and history museums.
Government delegates to the two-week conference in Kyoto are considering
proposals to protect or to relax protection on 97 types of flora and fauna,
including elephants, bluefin tuna, and tropical timbers, as well as many
lesser-known species.
Japanese customs officials said yesterday that they had uncovered an illegal
ivory shipment of about 370kg in a container from a vessel that had docked
at Kobe after travelling to South Africa, via South Korea, Taiwan and
Singapore. The haul is the second largest found in Japan since a 1989 ban on
the ivory trade, and follows the discovery of an 800kg shipment of tusks
last April.
