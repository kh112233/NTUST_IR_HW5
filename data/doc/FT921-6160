FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: ICI divisional alchemy only partly working
 -Pharmaceuticals produce 52% of trading profits with strong growth in new
drugs
ICI's DIVISIONS reported widely differing performances last year. While
pharmaceuticals and paints achieved record profits during 1991, the
performance of the core speciality chemical operations were described by Sir
Denys Henderson, chairman, as poor.
The pharmaceuticals operations increased trading profits by 10 per cent from
Pounds 489m to Pounds 538m on sales of Pounds 1.59bn (Pounds 1.42bn). The
business generated 12 per cent of group turnover and 52 per cent of trading
profits.
Sales growth of ICI's three newest drugs, Zestril, Zoladex and Diprivan,
averaged more than 50 per cent last year, said Mr Ronnie Hampel, ICI's new
chief operating officer. He said the pharmaceuticals performance had been
particularly strong in the US which now accounted for 47 per cent of sales.
About 10 per cent of the US growth had been achieved by increasing volume
and only 2 per cent through price rises.
Sir Denys admitted that worldwide government pressure on pharmaceutical
prices was of concern, but that its effect remained unclear. Spending on
pharmaceutical research and development was Pounds 220m in 1991 and was
likely to rise to Pounds 250m this year.
Trading profits in agrochemicals and seeds grew from Pounds 110m to Pounds
144m in spite of difficult market conditions. The business had continued to
benefit from cost reductions, said Mr Hampel. Turnover remained stable at
Pounds 1.36bn.
The paints business had enjoyed a record year, he said. Trading profits
increased by 9 per cent, from Pounds 108m to Pounds 118m, thanks to cost
reductions and improved margins within the context of weak markets
everywhere except in the Asia-Pacific region. Turnover fell from Pounds
1.64bn to Pounds 1.59bn.
Explosives produced a profit of Pounds 54m (Pounds 50m) in spite of
depressed conditions in the US and European mining and construction
industries, said Mr Hampel.
The core specialties businesses' profits fell 35 per cent to Pounds 35m
(Pounds 54m) on turnover of Pounds 1.27bn (Pounds 1.31bn). Both colours and
surfactants experienced further deterioration in their main markets.
Nevertheless, Quorn, the vegetarian meat substitute, had exceeded its
development targets following its launch in the UK, Belgium and the
Netherlands. The company was looking for partners, possibly in the food
industry, to exploit Quorn on a worldwide basis.
Materials reported increased losses of Pounds 20m (Pounds 10m). Turnover
fell from Pounds 2.14bn to Pounds 2.04bn. Mr Hampel said that was not
acceptable. Rationalisation continued in the fibres and films businesses.
Margins in the fibres business were not strong enough to produce
satisfactory results, he added.
Trading profits at the industrial chemicals operations were down 34 per cent
to Pounds 135m (Pounds 205m) on turnover of Pounds 3.61bn (Pounds 3.79bn).
The company said that reflected reduced sales volumes and margins in the
chemicals and polymers businesses which had been partly off-set by profit
from Tioxide, acquired in December 1990.
The group's 1990 results were restated to reclassify ICI's share of a
provision for the Tioxide Group as an exceptional rather than an
extraordinary item. The company said that was to meet the clarification of
the accounting treatment of restructuring costs issued by the Accounting
Standards Board. It had the effect of reducing 1990 pre-tax profits from
Pounds 977m to Pounds 936m and earnings per share from 87.9p to 82.3p.
