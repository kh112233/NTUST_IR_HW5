  [Text] One of the changes in top positions within the 
security forces is the appointment of Salvador Figueroa, the new 
director of the National Police. This has all occurred at a 
time at which the United States insists on classifying Guatemala 
as a country that is risky for foreign tourists. Regarding this 
matter, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has said: 
  [Begin De Leon Carpio recording] This is something that has 
not really been defined yet. The travel advisory has not really 
been established yet. What they have said is that a warning was 
issued because of the problem with stealing children, the 
smuggling of minors, and other illegal activities involving 
Guatemalan children. It is exclusively for that reason. It is 
exclusively for the United States because somehow some U.S. 
individual was involved. A travel advisory has not been 
officially established. 
  On the contrary, I read an interview with the Guatemalan 
president in THE MIAMI HERALD today. Comments on this were 
completely favorable, especially those by the executive director 
who was here for the Inter-American Press Association meeting. 
He spoke about the advantages of Guatemalan tourism. 
  So those reports are not true. There has been some 
exaggeration on this topic, not here but abroad, specifically in 
the United States. [end recording]
