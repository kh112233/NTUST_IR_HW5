  [Text] The three Baltic presidents have issued a joint 
statement on the extension of mutual and regional cooperation. 
  The document, signed by Algirdas Brazauskas, Guntis Ulmanis 
and Lennart Meri at the Palanga summit on Friday, states among 
other things that cooperation between Lithuania, Latvia and 
Estonia has developed to a great extent in the past year. 
  The presidents of the three Baltic states declared their 
readiness to fully coordinate their activities in strengthening 
their ties with Europe's political, economic and security 
structures. 
  Cooperation between Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia on the one 
hand and the Visegrad countries on the other will be encouraged 
and promoted. 
  The three Baltic leaders expressed hope that the Russian 
troops will be withdrawn from Latvia and Estonia by the end of 
this summer as fixed by the timetable earlier.
