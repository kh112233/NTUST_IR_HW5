RESEARCH USING FETAL TISSUE 
To me, a young Parkinson's victim of 35, the issues of fetal-cell research 
appear confused. Fetal-cell implants offer great hope to the victims of 
Parkinson's disease and other degenerative conditions. 
I am at a loss to understand the anti-abortion movement's objections. They 
contend that fetal-cell research is immoral because the material is obtained 
from a procedure that is immoral (abortion). This thinking is flawed. 
Do we insist that every victim of an automobile accident, who is a potential 
organ donor, not be a victim of the illegal and immoral act of drunk driving? 
Do we exclude victims of the fastest-growing immoral act in this country, 
violence, from being tissue donors? No! Then why does the anti-abortion 
movement insist on interfering with basic scientific research and our rights to 
benefit from such research?
