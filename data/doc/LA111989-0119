ABORTION PROTEST RESULTS IN VIOLENCE 
Hundreds of anti-abortion protesters took part in a second day of 
demonstrations in the Washington area to test a federal law barring such 
demonstrations in front of abortion clinics. Twenty-six protesters were 
arrested and several injuries were reported at the Hillview Clinic in Suitland, 
Md., police said. During the demonstration by Operation Rescue, some of the 500 
people on both sides of the abortion issue smashed a pane of glass as they 
pressed against the doors of the clinic. Scuffles broke out, causing several 
injuries. There were also large anti-abortion protests in Houston and 
Indianapolis.
