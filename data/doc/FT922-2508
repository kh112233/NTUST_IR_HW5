FT  17 JUN 92 / Czechs and Slovaks set to separate
THE break-up of the Czechoslovak federation appears imminent as Czech and
Slovak leaders meet again today to discuss the future of the country,
officials close to Czech negotiators said yesterday.
'We are convinced that a separation is unavoidable. The Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has clearly told us that it wants an independent
Slovakia regardless of economic difficulties,' they said. The nationalist
HZDS, led by Mr Vladimir Meciar, won 37 per cent of the vote in the Slovak
republic in the general election this month.
Mr Meciar will meet Mr Vaclav Klaus, the newly-elected Czech leader, in
Prague today for a third round of post-electoral negotiations. The talks
will be aimed at forming a minimal federal government which, the officials
said, would be charged with arranging the orderly liquidation of the
74-year-old federation.
Previous meetings have failed, with Mr Klaus categorically rejecting Slovak
demands for 'an economic and defence union of two sovereign states'.
The officials said that such a union was an attempt by Slovaks to build the
future institutions of an independent republic with federal subsidies. 'They
want a financial and economic umbrella under which they will erode the
federation,' they said.
They added that the Czech side would refuse to finance the federal budget
under such circumstances and that the federation could come to a de facto
end by the close of the year.
Both Mr Klaus and the Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czechoslovak president, have
stated that Mr Meciar's demand for a sovereign and internationally
recognised Slovakia are incompatible with the requirements of a common
state.
Negotiations are due to continue today and on Friday in Prague. But the
officials said that the two sides could even fail to form an interim federal
government as they disagreed on how to share power within it.
