  [Text] Bratislava, April 28 (CTK) -- The introduction of 
the certification requirement will not affect consumers, Slovak 
Agriculture Minister Pavol Koncos said today. Such was his 
response to Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus's statement that the 
requirement could cause consumer prices to rise in Slovakia by 
raising the cost of food products. 
  "On the contrary, it was the Czechs who adopted regulations 
that raise the prices of imported food products," Koncos said. 
He reminded journalists that the Czech Republic calculates 
value-added tax on imported food products based on prices 
adjusted to include duty payments, although duty is not charged 
on Slovak products because of the existence of the Customs 
Union. Slovakia is therefore forced to respond in a similar 
fashion, he said. 
  Within a month and a half at most, Czech imports to Slovakia 
will no longer be limited, Koncos added. The only goal of the 
requirement is to protect consumers from low quality products, 
he stated, adding however that the Slovak deficit in trade with 
agricultural and food products with the Czech Republic totalled 
nearly four billion crowns last year.
