FT  28 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: US buyers return for BP
BRITISH Petroleum received a much needed fillip for its dwindling share
price as a number of stories circulated in the market. The stock bounced 9
to 256p on 7.6m traded, with much of the interest reported to be from the
US. The buying was said to be partly prompted by an optimistic report in a
leading trade magazine about the prospects for the Cusiana oilfield in
Columbia.
Another report, originating from an independent Russian news agency, said BP
was negotiating the rights to participate in development of a large oil and
gas field in Siberia.
There was also speculation that the US authorities might be about to
introduce a more attractive tax regime for oil and gas explorers. However,
most observers attributed the rise to a technical bounce, and one story,
that Hanson might be preparing a bid, prompted cynical comments that some
traders could be generating rumours in order to square their books.
A decision by Rank Organisation to put its hotel business up for sale lifted
the leisure group's shares 13 to 739p. Analysts said the five London and 17
provincial hotels could have a potential price tag in excess of Pounds 300m,
although in the current depressed market that figure is debatable. However,
Rank let it be known that it was willing to wait years if necessary to exact
the right price.
Bears of Rank questioned the logic of selling one of its best potential
recovery businesses and the possible length of negotiations. However, a more
positive view was that Rank would be able to obtain a good price as the
hotel market improves, particularly for its prestige London sites, thus
reducing its debt burden.
Union Discount, troubled member of London's most elite monetary sector and
once the largest discount house in the world's premier financial market,
rose 9 to 138p on the disposal of its 'big ticket' leasing business to
French-owned Humberclyde Investments.
The shares still have a long way to go, however, after falling from last
year's peak of 600p, with Union's 'small ticket' business Sabre Leasing
remaining the worst problem, contributing to last year's group loss of
Pounds 23.5m.
Analysts said big ticket leasing, involving large items such as aircraft, is
saleable because of its tax advantages, but it would be a different story if
the small ticket office equipment business were to be offered for sale.
British Aerospace advanced 10 to 355p in brisk turnover of 7m as investors
appreciated the arrival of Mr Richard Lapthorne as finance director and the
winning of a Pounds 40m contract to upgrade Oman's Rapier anti-aircraft
missile system.
Contributing to the increased turnover were underwriters of last year's
failed rights issue releasing stock into the market, and profit-takers that
had recently bought shares at lower levels.
Food retailer Asda lost 1 1/2 at 27 1/2 p, after 26 1/2 p, on turnover of
17m, continuing the heavy trading seen in the stock during recent sessions.
The company is holding a series of meetings with securities houses at
present, and yesterday's decline in the share price followed a downgrading
by SG Warburg Securities, one of its brokers.
Growing belief that Lloyds Bank will bid for Midland, and that both banks
will benefit, ensured that Lloyds firmed 3 to 427p and Midland closed 6
better at 381p.
The market became aware that first-quarter figures from Sun Alliance were
encouraging, particularly following disappointing new life figures last week
from Legal &amp; General, up 11 at 382p. Sun said its new single premium
business was up by 150 per cent and its new annual premium business had
improved by 20 per cent. The stock, which has been the best performer in the
FT-SE 100 Index since the general election, gained a further 12 to 294p,
still a long way below the 392p price the shares attracted in August last
year.
Bargain hunters for property issues turned away from last week's star stocks
and sought other perceived value shares. Brixton Estates rose 7 to 176p,
Frogmore 22 to 318p and Capital &amp; Counties 26 to 221p.
Hopes of an economic upturn boosted stores in heavy turnover - although
County NatWest said it felt the sector was becoming overvalued. Investors
looking for recovery stocks were encouraged into Burton, which improved 3 to
50 1/2 p on turnover of 10m.
Shares in TI Group, which last week bid for Dowty Group, were in demand
after Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, confirmed an A1 rating
on TI's debt. Dowty added 3 at 180p.
Among transport stocks, Eurotunnel remained in the doldrums as the company
announced it was to appeal against a dispute panel's ruling in March that it
makes a Pounds 50m payment to TML, the Channel tunnel constructor, as a
settlement of the dispute between the two parties.
Wellcome fell sharply in early trading in reaction to a Sunday newspaper
article which raised doubts about the pharmaceutical company's anti-Aids
drug Retrovir and the origins of Aids. The stock closed a net 17 off at
1015p after being down 48 at one stage.
Bid speculation once again surrounded Fisons, which jumped 17 1/2 , a big
move for the stock, to 368p xd.
Neither a surprise announcement that ICI's US patent on its Nolvadex breast
cancer drug had been invalidated, nor concern over first-quarter figures,
held back the chemicals giant. The shares appreciated 9 to 1373p.
