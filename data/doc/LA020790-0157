P.M. BRIEFING; 
IVORY BAN HELD SAVING ELEPHANTS 
An international ban on ivory trading is proving effective in the struggle to 
save Africa's endangered elephants, a World Wide Fund for Nature official said 
today. 
The ban, agreed to by the United Nations Conference on International Trade in 
Endangered Species last October, has quashed the demand for ivory and forced 
prices down, fund spokesman Rick Weyerhaeuser said. 
"The price of ivory has fallen (about) 50% since the ban was announced," he 
said. "First indications are that (the ban) is proving successful." 
But he said the group fears the refusal of some southern African countries to 
accept the ban might jeopardize efforts to protect the continent's dwindling 
elephant population.
