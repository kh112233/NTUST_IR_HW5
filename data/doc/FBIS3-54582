  [Text] The eastern quarters of Kafr Tibnit and al-Nabatiyah 
al- Fawqah came under 12.7-mm machine-gun fire from the Israeli 
forces in Tallat 'Ali al-Tahir this morning. 
  The Israeli occupation forces today released three Lebanese 
and a Palestinian through the Red Cross. The Israeli Navy had 
seized them inside Lebanon's territorial waters. 
  The occupation forces also fired 16 shells, eight tank 
shells, and six mortars on Wadi Yatir. Helicopters fired more 
than 1,000 bullets at three fishermen, who were injured. 
  The UN Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] spokesman in the 
south has reported that two Swedish soldiers were wounded when a 
mine exploded in the al-Khiyam area. The leg of one soldier was 
amputated. An investigation into the incident has already 
started.
