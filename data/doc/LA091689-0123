ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT; 
FAA AWARDS $950,000 TO IMPROVE SECURITY 
The Federal Aviation Administration has awarded the county $950,000 to pay for 
security improvements at John Wayne Airport. 
The grant will be used for radio communications, card reader and video 
surveillance systems. 
"They were persuaded by the county's need," Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach) said Thursday. "This will spare the expense to county residents." 
Cox is one of two Republicans who sit on the House subcommittee on government 
activities and transportation, which will begin hearings Sept. 25 on aviation 
security in response to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, in December, 1988. 
"Generally we are updating airline security across the country," Cox said. 
The county will also receive $3.25 million this fiscal year to pay for airport 
improvements including roadways, taxiways, and aircraft rescue and firefighting 
vehicles. That money is part of $10 million budgeted for the airport through 
1992, but will be delivered earlier than expected.
