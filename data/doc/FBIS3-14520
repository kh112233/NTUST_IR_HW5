  [Text] Libya demanded the implementation of the agreement 
it signed with Chad in 1989 in the Algerian capital on the Aozou 
Strip and at the same time affirmed its intention to withdraw 
from that strip. 
  The agreement stipulates for the exchange of POW's following 
the war which broke out between the two countries over the Aozou 
Strip. 
  The Libyan foreign affairs minister affirmed his country's 
compliance with the decision of the International Court of 
Justice, which acknowledged Chad's claim over the Aozou Strip. 
  The Libyan official said in a letter he sent to the UN 
secretary general that Libya did not object to the decision and 
had no prior or subsequent conditions. 
  The Libyan foreign affairs minister mentioned that his 
country was only interested in reaching a final settlement to 
the Aozou Strip by peaceful means and logical practices. He 
said that required the implementation of the Algiers agreement. 
  The Libyan official pointed out that Chad insisted on 
obtaining a timetable on the withdrawal of the Libyan civilian 
and military administration from the Aozou Strip before studying 
the preparation of a mechanism for implementing and setting up 
committees for this purpose. 
  It is worth mentioning that the talks which started between 
the two sides since the beginning of this month have brought no 
results whatsoever.
