  [Text] The 37-member Republic of China [ROC] delegation 
left for the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea on 
Friday [15 April] to survey the ecology and environment there. 
The Council of Agriculture said in a statement scientists and 
officials boarded an ROC vessel that left the southern port of 
Kaohsiung for Taiping, an islet in the Spratlys for five-day 
scientific expedition. The government has said it may build an 
airport, a port, and a lighthouse on Taiping where ROC marines 
maintain a base. The Spratlys are also claimed wholly or in part 
by Brunei, Mainland China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and 
Vietnam. Taipei said it will never renounce its claim of 
sovereignty, but it is willing to cooperate with other countries 
on economic development.
