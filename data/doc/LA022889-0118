DEATH SENTENCE STANDS FOR POLICEMAN'S KILLER 
The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to set aside the death sentence of 
John G. Brown, convicted in 1982 of murdering Garden Grove Police Officer 
Donald Reed, 27. 
Brown killed Reed during a June 7, 1980, shoot-out at the Cripple Creek Saloon 
in Garden Grove when Reed tried to serve him with an arrest warrant. The 
officer was shot once in the chest and died shortly afterward. 
According to police testimony, when Brown saw Reed and two reserve officers 
enter the bar, he rose from his table and ran toward the building's rear door. 
At the door he pulled a .22-caliber automatic pistol from his jacket and began 
firing. 
After spraying bullets throughout the barroom, Brown fled on foot. Sheriff's 
deputies found him a few blocks away hiding in bushes. 
Reserve Officer Glen Overly, 21, was wounded in the chest, abdomen and hand, 
and Reserve Office Dwight Henninger, 20, was hit in the upper arm. Two 
customers, John Terzia and William McKinney, also were wounded during the 
shooting spree. 
At the time of the shooting, Brown was being sought on warrants for suspicion 
of assault with a deadly weapon and suspicion of selling marijuana, officials 
said. 
During his trial in Orange County Superior Court, Brown testified that he 
couldn't remember the shooting because amphetamines he had been taking caused a 
memory lapse. When Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown asked him why his 
fingerprints were found on the pistol used in the shooting, Brown answered: "My 
fingerprints probably are on 1,000 guns in Orange County." 
Brown's conviction received considerable attention in August when it was heard 
by the California Supreme Court. Prosecutors had asked the justices to adopt a 
new, less-stringent standard in determining whether errors had been committed 
during the appellate process. The jurists refused that request and upheld the 
death sentences of Brown and two other killers.
