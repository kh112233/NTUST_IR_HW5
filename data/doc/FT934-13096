FT  23 OCT 93 / VW to close Seat plant
VOLKSWAGEN, the German car group, yesterday formally told unions that it
intended to close down the Barcelona plant of Seat, its troubled Spanish
subsidiary, and shed 9,000 jobs.
The closure of the sprawling Zona Franca factory, on Barcelona's city
outskirts, has been widely expected as Seat tumbled into losses which are
expected to reach Pta100bn (Pounds 505.05m) this year.
At the end of last month Seat's chairman, Mr Jose Antonio Diaz Alvarez,
resigned when Volkswagen rejected as inadequate his scheme to cut 5,000 jobs
at Zona Franca. Over the past three weeks the German group has been
unsuccessfully lobbying the Spanish government in the hope that the
administration would ease its burden through an injection of public money.
Union leaders are due to meet in Barcelona today to co-ordinate what are
likely to be big protests. Volkswagen's job cuts represents the biggest
single labour shakeout in Spain's industrial history, as well as one of the
most emotive.
The Zona Franca plant, where Seat began producing cars in 1951, is held as
emblematic of Spain's post-war economic recovery.
Unions were told that the German group intended to shift production of the
Toledo model from Zona Franca to Martorell, a Pta244bn plant that opened
earlier this year and which will now become the main production centre of
the group's Spanish unit.
Production of the Marbella and the Terra models, which are also built at the
Barcelona plant, would be transferred to Volkswagen's subsidiary in Mexico.
Under Volkswagen's plan 1,700 Seat employees on short term contracts, will
be made redundant with immediate effect, while 3,000 workers over 55 years
old will be offered early retirement schemes. Jobs will be suspended for a
further 4,300 Zona Franca workers.
