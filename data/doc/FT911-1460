FT  04 MAY 91 / Exxon pulls out of spill settlement plan
EXXON last night withdrew from a proposed Dollars 1bn (Pounds 590m)
settlement stemming from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.
The oil company's decision followed votes by the Alaska state House of
Representatives on Thursday rejecting the settlement of civil claims as
inadequate. Last week a federal judge also rejected the Dollars 100m
criminal penalty portion of the settlement.
The company provided no details in its one-sentence announcement of the
termination.
The Alaska legislature had wanted to speed up payments that Exxon had to
make to the state to compensate for environmental damage caused by the worst
oil spill in US history. It had also wanted to increase the amounts the oil
company had to pay in criminal penalties.
Exxon's withdrawal from the settlement could, however, delay any payments to
the state of Alaska. The environmental damages case may now go to trial
unless an alternative settlement can be reached.
Eleven million gallons of crude oil spilled into the waters of Prince
William Sound in Alaska two years ago when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran
aground.
The spill killed thousands of sea birds, animals and fish as well as
disrupting the economy of the region. Exxon has already been forced to
undertake a multi-billion dollar operation to remove oil from the sea and
shorelines.
The Alaskan lawmakers had objected to provisions that would allow Exxon to
pay Dollars 900m in damages to the state over the next 11 years. Instead,
they have been seeking a Dollars 700m payment within a year, which they say
would allow the state to immediately undertake environmental restoration
projects.
