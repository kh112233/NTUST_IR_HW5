FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (8): A guide for
exiles in France
PROMPTED by the increasing demand for information about life as a resident
in France the French Chamber of Commerce in Britain has published Living as
a British Expatriate in France. Its contributors are specialists in their
subjects and most have experienced life as exiles.
What the expat will certainly need, the book's authors emphasise, will be
documentation, patience and a sense of humour, plus plenty of passport
photographs, translations of birth and marriage certificates and evidence of
divorce if applicable.
Keep travel tickets or, in some way, ensure that you have evidence of your
date of arrival in France. Proof of employment may be required and so will
stamped addressed envelopes.
There is a section on how to go about renting or buying a property. French
legislation on rentals has changed in the last decade and the law is
reasonably protective of tenants. There is information about employment
rights, taxation, the French health system, insurance and education.
The final section deals with retiring to France, with special reference to
tax implications.
The French Chamber of Commerce in Britain previously produced books on
Buying Residential Property in France, and Setting up a Small Business in
France.
