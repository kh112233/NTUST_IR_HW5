LOCAL; 
BUENA PARK MAN KILLED BY TRAIN 
A Buena Park man who was sitting on railroad tracks with a friend was killed 
after he refused to heed a train's warning to clear the tracks, Fullerton 
police said today. 
Larry Charles Peterson, 43, died around 11 p.m. Thursday when a Santa Fe 
Railroad freight train knocked him off the tracks in the 1800 block of West 
Commonwealth Avenue, Fullerton Sgt. Joe Klein said. 
Peterson's companion, 32-year-old Wesley Park of Long Beach, escaped injuries 
when he scampered away, Klein said. 
Klein said the conductor reported seeing two men sitting on the tracks as the 
train traveled between a small commercial complex at a speed of 45 m.p.h.. 
Park scampered off the tracks after the train's horn was sounded. The engineer 
told investigators that he braked but could not avoid slamming into Peterson, 
Klein said . 
The Buena Park man was struck in his face and was later pronounced dead from 
massive head injuries. 
Klein said investigators do not suspect foul play in the incident. 
Park, who was arrested on the scene for public drunkenness, was released on his 
own recognizance this morning. 
Klein said an autopsy would seek to determine whether Peterson also was 
intoxicated.
