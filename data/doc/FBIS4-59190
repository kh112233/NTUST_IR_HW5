  [Excerpt] In the last two days, the situation in Kabul city 
has been relatively calm and no clashes have taken place between 
the forces of the Islamic Army of Afghanistan and the 
opposition. A BIA correspondent who visited various parts of 
the city today, says that today too, as yesterday, the military 
situation in the city was calm. Taking advantage of this normal 
situation, the people of Kabul were able to obtain their 
supplies of goods and visit their relatives. Although no 
official cease-fire has been declared, there has been no reports 
of occurrence of any fighting. The BIA correspondent, quoting 
official sources of the country, rejects a report by the BBC 
radio concerning the upsurge of heavy fighting and the exchanges 
of missiles, machine-gun, and heavy weaponry that was alleged to 
have taken place in central Kabul yesterday between the 
government forces and opposition. The report was considered as 
unfounded and far from the truth. [passage omitted]
