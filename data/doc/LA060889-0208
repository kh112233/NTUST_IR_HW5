P.M. BRIEFING; 
BAN ON SEALSKIN IMPORTS EXTENDED 
The European Community today imposed a permanent ban on baby sealskin imports. 
The decision, announced at a meeting of EC environment ministers in Luxembourg, 
delighted a crowd of about 100 animal welfare demonstrators from all over the 
12-nation community. 
"We're terribly happy. It's the best we could have hoped for," said Enid Homard 
of Britain, who belongs to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. 
A six-year EC import ban on the skins of harp and hooded seal pups, due to 
expire Oct. 1, was made permanent to help protect the species from extinction. 
The skins are sold as luxury fur goods in the West.
