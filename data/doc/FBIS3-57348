<F P=106> [J.-A.F. report: "`My Father Was Victim of Political </F>
Murder,' We Were Affirmed by Constantin Gamsakhurdia"] 
  [Text] "Although I do not yet know the exact circumstances 
of my father's death, I do know one thing: It was a political 
murder!" Constantin Gamsakhurdia, son of the former Georgian 
president who died in early January in as yet unexplained 
circumstances, does not mince his words: In his opinion, his 
father, whom he does not suspect of having committed suicide, 
was the victim of a conspiracy. 
  Passing through Paris, he affirmed to us: "It is a typically 
Communist method to cast doubts on the circumstances of my 
father's death and on his death itself: Information is filtered 
to soothe emotions. If the Georgian population had immediately 
been informed about my father's death, it would have come out 
into the streets to display its grief. Constantin Gamsakhurdia 
agrees with the idea, put forward by his mother and endorsed by 
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, for an international 
commission to investigate Zviad Gamsakhurdia's death, but he 
thinks it will be difficult to find witnesses: "Those who know 
how my father died are partisans. What will be done to them 
after they give their testimony?"
