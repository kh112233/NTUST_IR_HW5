in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) a new licensing procedure to permit U.S. encryption manufacturers
to make multiple shipments of items covered by Category XIII(b)(1) of the United States Munitions List (USML) directly
to end users in an approved country without obtaining individual licenses.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In April 1993, the President ordered a review of U.S. policy regarding the domestic use of, and export controls on,
encryption technology. That review resulted in a determination that vital U.S. interests_national security, economic,
and law enforcement_compel maintaining appropriate control of encryption. It also revealed that there are measures
which can be taken to reform the existing export controls to ensure that controls are not unduly burdensome to U.S.
exporters. On February 4, 1994, the Department of State announced reforms to the export control procedures applicable
to products incorporating encryption technology.




This final rule implements one of these reforms. Previously, almost every encryption export required an individual
license. Only those exports covered by a distribution arrangement could be shipped without an individual license.
This final rule, which adds a 124.15 to the ITAR, provides for a licensing procedure which permits direct distribution
from the U.S. manufacturer, thus reducing the regulatory burden on exporters without a foreign distributor. The
number of individual license applications required will also be reduced.




Under this new licensing arrangement, U.S. encryption manufacturers may ship their products covered in Category
XIII(b)(1) from the United States directly to customers within approved countries without obtaining individual
licenses for each end user. The procedures are similar to existing distribution agreement procedures. Exporters
are required to submit a proposed arrangement identifying, among other things, specific items to be shipped, proposed
end users and end use and countries to which the items are destined. Upon approval of the arrangement, exporters will
be permitted to ship the specified products directly to end users in the approved countries based on a single license.
Therefore, manufacturers of products covered in Category XIII(b)(1) will now have the option to export to foreign
distributors under a distribution agreement or directly from the U.S. under the new arrangement.




Section 123.16(b)(1) is revised in conformity with the addition of 124.15, and to substitute the more precise
term ``defense hardware'' for ``defense article''.




The Department of State views this reform as beneficial to U.S. persons and industry and has decided to implement it
immediately by publication of a final rule. Notwithstanding this final rule, public comment is welcomed.




This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States. It is exempt from review under E.O. 12866
and has been reviewed internally by the Department to ensure consistency with the purposes thereof. It is also excluded
from the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554.
