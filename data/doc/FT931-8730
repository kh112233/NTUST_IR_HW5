FT  18 FEB 93 / Beijing frees top student activists
CHINA yesterday released the last two student activist leaders rounded up
after the 1989 pro-democracy protests that led to hundreds of deaths in
Beijing's central Tiananmen square after the army fired on protesters.
The early release of Wang Dan, who topped the most-wanted list, and
fellow-student Guo Haifeng is a further indication that China is anxious to
cool criticism of its human rights record. Several other dissidents have
been released recently.
The New China News Agency said the freeing of Wang and Guo meant that 'all
the students who violated the criminal law during the anti-government
disturbances in 1989. . . have been released'.
The freeing of the students, several months before their terms expired,
comes on the eve of delicate trade talks with visiting US officials, the
first high-level team from the Clinton administration to visit Beijing.
At the talks, China's huge trade surplus with the US will be discussed.
The dissidents' release also coincides with the presentation this week to
International Oympic Committee members of documents supporting Beijing's bid
to stage the Olympic Games in the year 2000.
Human rights groups have been opposing Beijing's candidacy in protest at
China's continued imprisonment of political activists.
The release of the two students by no means closes the chapter on the
Tiananmen square episode, however.
A number of 'non-student' dissidents rounded up after the incident remain in
prison.
In another gesture yesterday, China also freed a 76-year-old Roman Catholic
bishop, who had been sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment.
Bishop Zhu Hongsheng's continued detention had prompted protests
internationally.
