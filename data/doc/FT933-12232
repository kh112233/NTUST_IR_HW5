FT  26 JUL 93 / Turkish tourist site hit by blast
A BOMB exploded yes-terday at a tourist site in central Istanbul, injuring
an Italian tourist and three Turks, Reuter reports from Istanbul.
The Anatolian news agency quoted police as saying that the bomb had been
left in a litter basket under an automated bank teller machine near the
sixth-century Haghia Sophia Cathedral.
Separatist rebels of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) meanwhile kidnapped
four French tourists in south-eastern Turkey yesterday.
However, it was not immediately clear whether the bomb attack was connected
with threats by the outlawed secessionist party to attack Turkish tourist
sites.
Police said that the Italian tourist at the bombing site was slightly
injured. The three Turks were also slightly hurt.
The bombing is not reported to have caused any damage to the Haghia Sophia,
which is one of the world's most celebrated monuments of Byzantine
architecture.
