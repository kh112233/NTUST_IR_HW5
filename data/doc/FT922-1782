FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Planet Hollywood goes on release in
London's Trocadero
THE BRITISH film industry may be as sick as a parrot, but Planet Hollywood
is alive and well and plans a landing in London.
Robin Power, the dentist cum property baron, yesterday announced that his
Power Corporation had signed the US restaurant group as the latest tenants
in the Trocadero Centre site in London's Piccadilly Circus.
The 20,000 sq ft restaurant - to open in December - is part of a chain in
which Hollywood hardmen Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce
Willis are minority investors.
It will come complete with a 90-seat cinema designed to appeal to leading
movie moguls and a glamour set anxious to show their latest wares, while
dining on down home fare of the Californian persuasion.
Planet Hollywood said the restaurant would be 'dripping' with Hollywood
memorabilia. Diners with strong stomachs would be able to watch Hollywood's
100 most famous punch-ups, while romantics could enjoy the 100 greatest
cinema clinches on movie screens around the restaurant. The total cost of
fitting out the Planet Hollywood set would run to about Pounds 5m.
For Power, the deal at an initial Pounds 32.50 a sq ft adds yet another
string to its Trocadero bow. Mr Nick Orme, Power managing director, said
some 350,000 sq ft of the 440,000 sq ft available was now let.
Planet Hollywood in the US is embroiled in an epic battle with Peter Morton,
co-founder of Hard Rock Cafe.
Mr Morton claims Dollars 1.4bn in damages from Planet Hollywood and Rank
Organisation, for alleged infringement of trade marks, theft of trade
secrets and unfair competition.
