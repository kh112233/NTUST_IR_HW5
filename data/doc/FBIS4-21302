  An article in the latest issue of ZHONGHUA WENZHAI (CHINA 
DIGEST) revealed that the Central Commission on Politics and Law 
paid special attention to the activities of secret societies in 
China and took them as one of the 10 major targets of the 
anticrime action. The Ministry of State Security also took 
organized crime as a highly dangerous phenomenon to be brought 
under strict supervision and control. The ministry has launched 
three major campaigns against secret societies: From Shaoyang in 
the south, to Harbin in the north, and to Lintong in the west. 
The article, entitled "Are There Mafias in China?" revealed that 
hundreds of criminal gangs often fought each other openly in the 
streets of Shaoyang, western Hunan. The 1991 anticrime campaign 
solved 4,041 cases, including 1,096 major ones; eliminated 801 
criminal gangs; and arrested 6,175 gangsters, including 1,299 
backbone members of the gangs in Shaoyang. The crime syndicates 
in Harbin operated as business enterprises, controlling the 
construction market in the city. The article also revealed that 
crime syndicates in China were involved in international 
criminal activities, such as drug trafficking and 
counterfeiting. [Summary] [Beijing ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE in
