Nansha"] 
  [Text] A Vietnamese company has violated China's 
sovereignty in the Nansha Islands [Spratlys], a Chinese oil firm 
said yesterday in Beijing. 
  It said the activities of the Vietnam Oil and Gas 
Corporation 
in the South China Sea area have also infringed on China's 
offshore oil interests. 
  Chen Bingqian, spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil 
Corporation (CNOOC), said the Vietnamese company recently marked 
a group of blocks around the Nansha Islands for foreign bidding. 
  Moreover, the Vietnamese company has entered contracts with 
overseas partners to explore the area. Chen did not disclose 
the names of the foreign firms. 
  "This has violated China's sovereignty rights over the 
Nansha 
offshore area and also infringed on our company's interests," he 
said. 
  Chen also stressed that China will not accept any Vietnamese 
denouncement of CNOOC and its partners' exploration of the area. 
Last month a Vietnamese newspaper accused CNOOC and a US firm of 
violating Vietnam's sovereignty by signing a contract to develop 
the socalled Si Zhen Tan block. 
  The area, named Wan An Tan in Chinese, is located in the 
Nansha offshore area under China's jurisdiction, Chen said. 
  CNOOC and Crestone of the U.S. agreed in 1992 to develop the 
25,000 square metre block in a deal called Wan An Bei-21. 
  According to the contract, CNOOC and Crestone are to conduct 
seismic work and drilling in the section. 
  The Vietnamese article called for the termination of the 
contract and all related activities, Chen said. 
  But he said the contract has legal binding force and CNOOC 
and Crestone are entitled to operate in the area. 
  "We cannot accept unreasonable demands made by Vietnam," he 
said. 
  Chen said CNOOC has followed Chinese policy. 
  The government has stated that disputes in the Nansha issue 
may be put aside and joint development with the Vietnamese can 
be made.
