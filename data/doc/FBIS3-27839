  [Text] Osaka, Feb. 1 KYODO -- Takeda Chemical Industries 
Ltd. said Tuesday [1 February] it will establish a 
pharmaceutical production company in Tianjin, China, in March 
with a local pharmaceutical firm. 
  It will be Takeda's first joint venture in China, company 
officials said. 
  They said the venture, Tianjin Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co., 
will be capitalized at 19.2 million dollars (2 billion yen). 
  Takeda, Japan's top pharmaceutical maker, will provide 75 
percent of the capital, while the local partner Lisheng 
Pharmaceutical Factory Tianjin will put up 25 percent. 
  The new factory, expected to start operation after two and a 
half years, will produce six drugs, including an anti-prostate 
cancer agent and a cerebral vasodilator. It will market the 
products in China where the need for health care is growing, the 
officials said. 
  The new venture is expected to post about 2 billion yen in 
sales in 1997, they added.
