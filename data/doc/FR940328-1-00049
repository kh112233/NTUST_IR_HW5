Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposed Addition of 30 
African Birds to List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife 


<AGENCY>

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule and notice of petition finding.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Service proposes to add 30 kinds of birds, found in Africa and on associated islands, to the List of Endangered and
Threatened Wildlife. All have restricted distributions and are threatened by habitat destruction, human hunting,
predation by introduced animals, and various other factors. All were subjects of petitions from the International
Council for Bird Preservation, submitted in 1980 and 1991. This proposal, if made final, would implement the protection
of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, for these birds. The Service also makes the finding that the listing
of 38 additional species of birds, included in the 1991 petition, is warranted but precluded because of other listing
activity.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments on the proposed rule must be submitted by July 26, 1994. Public hearing requests must be received by May 12,
1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
Background 



In a petition of November 24, 1980, to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), the International Council for
Bird Preservation (ICBP) requested the addition of 79 kinds of birds to the U.S. List of Endangered and Threatened
Wildlife. Of that number, 58 occurred entirely outside of the United States and its territories. Of those foreign
birds, 6 have now been listed and the rest have been covered by petition findings that their listing is warranted but
precluded by other listing activity. 

Subsequently, in a petition dated April 30, 1991, and received by the Service on May 6, 1991, the ICBP requested the
addition of another 53 species of foreign birds to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. In the 

Federal Register

 of December 16, 1991 (56 FR 6520765208), the Service announced the finding that this petition had presented
substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. At that same time the Service initiated
a status review of these 53 birds, with the comment period lasting until March 16, 1992. The review yielded 22 comments,
one of them expressing general support for listing and all the rest suggesting that listing of the salmon-crested
cockatoo and/or the blue-throated macaw would interfere unnecessarily with the captive propagation of these species
and with commerce in birds resulting from such propagation (there did not appear to be any question that wild populations
of both species face severe threats and that importation of wild-caught individuals should be generally prohibited).
