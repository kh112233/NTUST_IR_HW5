  [Text] Beijing, May 12 KYODO -- China denounced on 
Thursday [12 May] a joint U.S.-Japanese-Vietnamese project to 
develop oil deposits under the ocean floor in the South China 
Sea off Vietnam. 
  Japan Petroleum Exploration Corp., Indonesia Petroleum Ltd. 
and Nissho Iwai Corp. of Japan and Mobil Corp. of the United 
States last month signed a contract on the project with the 
Vietnamese state-run oil corporation. 
  A Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman said the project for 
development of oil deposits in waters 400 kilometers off Vietnam 
infringed Chinese rights and interests and was illegal. 
  It said the area is part of waters around the 
Chinese-claimed 
Spratly Islands. 
  The islands are objects of territorial disputes involving 
China, Vietnam and other Asian nations.
