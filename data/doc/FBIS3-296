  [Text] ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia], one of the three signatories of Liberia's Cotonou 
Peace Accord, along with the interim government, and Charles 
Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Forces of Liberia], seems to 
be in some difficulties. There have been reports that its 
soldiers at Tubmanburg have been refusing to allow ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African State Cease-fire Monitoring 
Group] troops to deploy, insisting that they should receive 
money in exchange for the arms they surrender. They have sacked 
their representative on the Transitional Council that is 
supposed to guide the country to elections later this year. And 
now ULIMO's chairman, Alhaji Koromah, has called us up from 
Monrovia to say there is fresh fighting going on. Josephine 
Hazely asked him what his claim was: 
  [Begin recording] [Koromah] Well, it is very unfortunate 
that today we have had to send a letter to ECOMOG informing them 
on an emergency basis that Charles Taylor's NPFL has launched 
unprovoked attacks for the past three days against ULIMO 
positions, one in the Salayie district near the town of Golu, 
under the command of one so-called Major Black Gina of the NPFL. 
They attacked our forces, wounding three of them, and fierce 
fighting is now going on. 
  [Hazely] Where is the other attack? 
  [Koromah] The other attack is in the Foya district, a place 
called Palm Bay Farm, commonly called Vietnam, where General 
Faya of the NPFL, along with the Revolutionary United Front 
forces, have attacked the surrounding villages and killed about 
24 to 26 civilians. Our forces have engaged them and for the 
past four days fierce fighting has been going on. He is busy 
attacking... [pauses] making fresh attacks on our position which 
we have no alternative but to resist. 
  [Hazely] Are you sure of your facts here, Alhaji Koromah, 
because people will find these claims that you are making 
unbelievable. Why would Mr. Taylor want to attack ULIMO 
positions at this time? Why? 
  [Koromah] We don't know, because we have been hearing lots 
of rumors that he wants to connect by land between Bong County 
and Sierra Leone. A lot of [words indistinct] born in Sierra 
Leone, because he wants to send some of his arms, his military 
arms, to Fode Sankor so that when the government is seated he 
can launch a full-scale attack. And also he does not intend to 
be disarmed totally. He wants an opportunity of unseating the 
government. So clearly because the attacks that we are getting 
are coming from both the Sierra Leone end and the Bong County 
end. So this confirms the speculation that he is trying to make 
a land connection between Bong County and Sierra Leone, but that 
cannot be...[pauses] we cannot accept that to be a monkey 
wrench, because he threw a monkey wrench in this peace process. 
  [Hazely] But where are the peacekeepers? I thought, 
perhaps, the peacekeepers -- UNOMIL [United Nations Observe 
Mission in Liberia] -- are all over Liberia keeping watch. 
  [Koromah] They are not all over, they are not all over. 
They are in few places closer to Monrovia. 
  [Hazely] Yesterday, we got a report that your forces were 
refusing to hand over their weapons to the peacekeeping force, 
the African peacekeeping force, and they were saying they wanted 
money in exchange. Is this perhaps... [pauses] these claims you 
are making, could it not be that you want to deflect attention 
from the problems within your organization? 
  [Koromah] Well, let me tell you something. I told one of 
your colleagues before that your reporter that you have here 
must be in the employ of somebody because, in the first place, 
ECOMOG will not tell you that they sent any troops toward Po 
River, and whatever contingent of ECOMOG, he should ask them if 
they even went near Po River. There was nobody present, there 
has been no schedule for Po River and Tubmanburg where our 
headquarter is, and we have made it clear that the troops will 
be deployed in Boming Hills as they are deployed in Gbarnga. 
  [Hazely] Couldn't there be a split in your movement also in 
terms of the replacing of Dr. Mohammed Sheriff with Thomas Ziah 
and perhaps your troops are fighting over that, and you are 
claiming now that it is Taylor who is fighting? 
  [Koromah] That has nothing to do with the attacks against 
our forces. What I am trying to say about the attacks can be 
verified. The areas are approachable so that shouldn't be a 
mystery to you. If there are problems within our organization, 
okay, that is natural, and we are going to deal with those 
problems today and tomorrow and you will hear the results of 
that particular problem of the question of how elections are 
carried out in the Council of State. But that does not mean we 
will sit here and allow that to cover the heinous crime of 
attacks against not only ULIMO soldiers but also the 24 to 36 
elders and children that were killed. The Kissi people in Foya 
district were killed by General Faya, who is also a Kissi, but 
he is a general of NPFL. He is says that his people are 
exposing him to ULIMO, and I think everybody has listened to 
this particular interview from the Foya district that are now in 
Lofa can attest to this. [end recording]
