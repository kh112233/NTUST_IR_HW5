  [Text] The third safe house used by the Basque Fatherland 
and Liberty [ETA] terrorists in Barcelona was rented, along with 
the other two apartments, by Benjamin Ramos Vega, 32, and a 
German woman, Gabrielle E. Kanze, 38. 
  According to the police, Ramos was a friend of one of the 
members of the Barcelona commando which was disbanded when its 
head, Felipe San Epifanio, alias Pipe, was arrested. 
  The Renault 5 which was blown up by the police this evening 
in Zaragoza was used by members of the Barcelona commando when 
they were fleeing Barcelona. Ramos is said to have also rented
