GENETIC PARENTS IN SURROGATE CASE GET TEMPORARY CUSTODY 
A judge awarded temporary custody of an infant to his genetic parents this 
morning and trimmed the visiting privileges of the surrogate mother who was 
hired to bear the child. 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert N. Parslow Jr. ordered that the 
child, called Michael Christian, be turned over to Mark and Crispina Calvert 
rather than to surrogate mother Anna L. Johnson pending a hearing next month. 
Johnson, 29, was paid $10,000 under a contract to bear the child, the product 
of in vitro fertilization of the Calverts' egg and sperm. 
The infant, a 6-pound, 10-ounce boy born eight days ago, has shown signs of the 
stress of the conflict, said the court-appointed guardian, William Steiner, at 
an Orange County Superior Court hearing this morning. 
Steiner said he believed it would be "in the best interests of the baby . . . 
to remain with the Calverts." 
Parslow also decided today to cut Johnson's visitation rights from daily to 
twice a week. 
He could have placed the infant with Johnson, or in a foster home, pending full 
resolution of the lawsuit. 
The landmark case, with potentially broad impact on the legal concept of 
parenthood, is the first in which a surrogate mother has claimed a child to 
whom she is not genetically linked.
