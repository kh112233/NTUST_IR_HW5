<F P=106> [Article by Leena Hietanen: "Estonian Abortion Numbers </F>
Highest in Europe"] 
  [Text] Tallinn -- In Western countries the women who need 
abortions are young and unmarried using abortion to postpone 
their first time of giving birth. In Estonia abortion is used 
most often by women who are married and have already had 
children. This is the finding of a study published last fall 
which is the first study of its kind in the region covered by 
the former USSR. 
<H5>  First Pregnancy Leads to Marriage </H5>
  The abortion study was conducted by Estonian population 
researchers Kalev Katus and Allan Puur together with the 
University of Michigan. The study is part of a broader study on 
fertility. 
  Some 360 women who had had abortions in a Tallinn hospital 
during 1991 were interviewed in the study. The researchers had 
hospital data on the women in addition to the information 
supplied by the women. 
  The information supplied by the women and the hospital had a 
high degree of correlation, which is a significant difference 
between this study and studies elsewhere in the world. In 
Sweden, for example, women reported only one-half of their 
abortions, and in the United States only one-third. 
  "In general, no moral or guilt issues are connected with 
abortion, and thus they are no embarrassment," says Allan Puur. 
  Sixty-eight percent of the women having abortions are 
married, 18 percent are in cohabitation arrangements, and 14 
percent are unmarried. In Western countries an average of 75 
percent of abortions are by young, unmarried women. 
  In Estonia the first pregnancy generally leads to marriage. 
When a woman becomes pregnant she would rather legalize the 
relationship. In Estonia the age at which women get married is 
quite young, 23, while in Finland this age is 26, and in Sweden 
27. 
  The objective of the study is to determine who are the women 
that resort to abortions the most often. 
  "The ethnic background was the most consistent factor 
apparent for those who choose abortion as a means of birth 
control. Russian women have more abortions than Estonian women 
do," observed Allan Puur. 
  According to the study, 43 percent of the Estonian women had 
had no previous abortions. The comparable figure for 
non-Estonian women was 29 percent. Four percent of the Estonians 
and 9 percent of non-Estonians had had three abortions 
previously. 
  "For Estonian women an abortion is usually the result of an 
unsuccessful effort at birth control, whereas for Russians it is 
actually the primary means of birth control," says Puur. 
  According to the researchers the difference in conduct for 
Estonian and Russian women is basically due to the different 
times at which changes in population growth patterns first 
became apparent. In Estonia, the drop from a high fertility rate 
to a low one occurred much earlier than in Russia. That is why 
there is a much older tradition of controlling population growth 
in Estonia. 
  Allan Puur does not believe that prostitution is in any way 
reflected in the statistics. The number of abortions in Estonia 
was high already decades prior to abortion becoming an issue. 
  Customs that originated during the USSR era may be one 
explanation as to why abortion is used as a method of birth 
control. 
  The researchers included a question on whether birth control 
means had been used in the period of time preceding the last 
abortion. Fifty-two percent of Estonian women had been using 
some means of birth control while the comparable figure for 
non-Estonians was 18 percent. 
<H5>  Birth Control Expensive </H5>
  A gynecologist at Tallinn Central Hospital, Mall Varvas, 
feels that Estonia's high abortion numbers are due to the fact 
that society has a positive attitude toward abortion. 
  During the last three years it has been easy to obtain 
contraceptives in Estonia. Condoms are found in drug stores and 
on the shelves of newsstands. The most popular item, an 
intrauterine device, costs 50 kroons or about 20 markkas. Birth 
control pills cost about 20-25 markkas per month, which is too 
much for young women, according to Mall Varvas. The intrauterine 
device is most popular with both women who have and who have not 
given birth because of its lower cost. Abortions are usually 
free of cost. For those who do not belong to the government 
health program it costs about 180 markkas. 
  Varvas suspects that the young do not like to use condoms 
for 
the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases has increased 
significantly. 
  "The low level of contraceptive use is a result of a lack of 
concern about one's own personal health in Estonia. People do 
not talk about healthy life-styles." 
  "There are also deficiencies in the training of doctors. We 
have not been trained to dispense information. Doctors do not 
give patients birth control instructions even during the 
abortion treatment," says Varvas.
