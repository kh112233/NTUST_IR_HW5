  [Text] Bratislava, April 7 (CTK) -- The division of the 
former Czechoslovak Army has not been completed, former Slovak 
Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak said at a meeting of the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) last night. 
  He claimed that "the Czech Republic owed Slovakia part of 
the 
archives of two intelligence service divisions, part of the 
archives of the Military Historical Institute, historical 
monuments and 800 million crowns worth of values which could not 
be transferred without harming the Czech party." 
  "I doubt it that the present government would deal with 
problems related to property division," transport minister in 
the former government of Vladimir Meciar Roman Hofbauer said. 
  He denounced the "accommodating attitude" of the new cabinet 
of Jozef Moravcik in negotiations with Prague on the mutual 
recognition of food quality certificates and the will to discuss 
Czech demands, including the recognition of Slovakia's 24 
billion crown debt arising from the former Czechoslovak State 
Bank's final account. 
  At a session of the Customs Union Council at the end of 
March, Prague and Bratislava agreed to mutually recognize the 
certificates on the condition that Slovakia's customs 
legislation is amended. 
  During the March talks between the banking councils of the 
Czech and Slovak National Banks on the abolition of the "old 
bloc" on the clearing account, the Czech bank's Governor Josef 
Tosovsky praised the fact that Slovakia had not challenged the 
results of an audit carried out in the former Czechoslovak bank. 
According to it, Slovakia owes the Czech Republic more than 24 
billion crowns (over $800,000).
