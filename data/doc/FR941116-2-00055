<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) 
and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating 
the grant of a partially exclusive license in a limited field of 
use to practice the inventions embodied in U.S. Patent 5,104,977 
(formerly U.S. Patent Application 06/423,203) entitled ``Purified 
Transforming Growth Factor Beta'' and its foreign counterparts, 
including inventions deriving priority from U.S. Patent 
Applications 06/500,832 and 06/500,927, to Celtrix 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. having a place of business at Santa Clara, 
California. The patent rights in these inventions have been 
assigned to the United States of America. 



The prospective partially exclusive license will be for the field 
of ophthalmology. It will be royalty-bearing and will comply 
with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 

The prospective partially exclusive license may be granted 
unless, within sixty days from the date of this published Notice, 
NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that 
the grant of the license would not be consistent with the 
requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 

This invention relates to a protein known as transforming growth 
factor-beta (TGF-beta) and its uses. The U.S. patent (5,104,977) 
issued on April 14, 1992 and has a divisional (USPA 07/816,563) 
and two continuations (08/048,956 and 08/267,227) currently 
pending at the U.S. PTO. The invention contains both composition 
of matter and method of using claims to TGF-beta. The invention 
facilitates studies relating TGF-

b

's normal physiological 
function, and structural analysis, which could provide 
information on cloning of the TGF-

b

 protein. Production of TGF-

b

 
in mass quantities might have useful therapeutic application in 
enhancement of wound healing and tissue repair. Requests for a 
copy of the above identified patent applications, inquiries, 
comments and other materials relating to the contemplated license 
should be directed to: Dr. Carl Floyd, Office of Technology 
Transfer, National Institutes of Health, 6011 Executive 
Boulevard, Box 13, Rockville, Maryland 208523804 (telephone: 
(301) 4967735 ext. 246; FAX: (301) 4020220). A signed 
Confidential Disclosure Agreement will be required to receive 
copies of the patent application(s). Properly filed competing 
applications for a license filed in response to this notice will 
be treated as objections to the grant of the contemplated 
license. Only written comments and/or applications for a license 
which are received by the NIH Office of Technology Transfer on or 
before January 17, 1995 will be considered.
