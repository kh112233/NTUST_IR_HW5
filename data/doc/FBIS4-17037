  [Excerpt] TALLINN, Apr 20, BNS - Estonian Prime Minister 
Mart Laar on his visit to the United States met with Vice 
President Al Gore in Washington Tuesday [19 April]. 
  Laar in his remarks to the Voice of America ahead of the 
meeting said getting a reconfirmation of America's support to 
the demand for an early withdrawal of Russian troops for Estonia 
was one of the main aims of his visit. This, as well as 
economic cooperation are also to top the list at the meeting 
with the Vice President, he said. 
  "At this meeting a number of very important agreements on 
economic cooperation will be signed," Laar told VOA. 
  Commenting later on the outcome of the meeting with Al Gore, 
Laar said "the American side was in a very concrete manner ready 
to respond to our main proposals." He said it now depends on 
Estonia's other departments how quickly (the work on) these 
agreements will proceed, the PAEVALEHT newspaper reports with 
reference to VOA. 
  Laar had meetings with U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry 
and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Monday. The 
prime minister said that Estonia had received very strong 
support to the demand that Russian troops be pulled out of the 
country by Aug. 31. [passage omitted]
