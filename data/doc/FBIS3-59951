  [Text] Budapest, 21 Dec (MTI) -- The first stage of 
destroying conventional weapons under a European agreement ended 
at Godollo today in the presence of an international military 
observer group. 
  Deputy State Secretary of Defence Zoltan Pecze told the 
press 
that the 34 signatories to the 1991 European agreement on the 
elimination of conventional arms agreed to destroy part of their 
armaments by 1994 so as to reduce the danger of war, prevent the 
senseless arms race, and build mutual confidence. 
  The agreement obliges Hungary to destroy 510 tanks, 65 
armoured vehicles, and 207 artillery pieces. Curuss Rt, a 
Godollo-based company commissioned to carry out the task, has so 
far destroyed 139 tanks, 89 armoured vehicles and 56 artillery 
pieces. Cut up with oxy-acetylene torches, sections are sold as 
scrap to metal dealers. 
  The foreign delegation composed of U.S., British, Spanish, 
and Belgian officers supervised the cutting up of 14 tanks. 
  Some countries are obliged to destroy fighter planes and 
helicopters, too. This obligation, though, does not apply to 
Hungary whose stock of this category of military equipment 
remains below internationally agreed limits.
