CHET FORTE PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD, TAX VIOLATIONS 
Emmy Award-winning sports television producer Chet Forte pleaded guilty today 
to federal income tax and fraud charges 
His attorney said the charges were a result of compulsive gambling. 
Forte helped make "Monday Night Football" a national pastime when he worked for 
ABC Sports. 
The plea was accepted by U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Rodriguez. Forte, 54, 
faces a maximum 11 years in prison and $27,000 in fines when he is sentenced 
Jan. 11. 
Forte was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges he fraudulently obtained 
nearly $1.5 million in loans from banks and mortgage companies. He was charged 
with failing to file a 1987 income tax return. 
The charges allege Forte concealed hundreds of thousands of dollars in debts 
owed Atlantic City casinos, as well as Internal Revenue Service assessments.
