  [Text] The headquarters of the Federation of 
Independent Russian Trade Unions held a meeting on the problems 
of organizing summer vacations for children and preserving the 
population's health. 
  The prices of vacation passes have risen abruptly, and the 
costs of maintaining a single vacationer increased last year by 
almost 40 times in comparison with 1991. The average cost of a 
pass exceeds the minimum wage set by the government 15 times. 
The closing and respecialization of health improvement 
institutions, including children's, have assumed threatening 
proportions, their construction has been halted for practical 
purposes, and health institutions are being sold off at 
bargain-basement prices. 
  Diseases such as poliomyelitis, diphtheria and tularemia, 
which had not been registered at all in Russia for many years, 
have reappeared among children. Over 1,300 illnesses occur 
annually in every 1,000 children and adolescents. Of 42 million 
children, only 10-14 percent come to primary school healthy. 
  A resolution adopted at the meeting called for developing 
the 
``Russian Health Resorts'' and ``Children's Vacations'' 
programs, and offering tax advantages and preferential loans to 
enterprises of the sanatorium and health resort complex. There 
are plans for establishing a republican reserve fund from which 
to compensate the expenses of travel to vacation places, and 
part of the cost of passes. The participants of the meeting 
concluded that there was a need for creating permanent 
interregional commissions on organizing vacations for children 
and laborers.
