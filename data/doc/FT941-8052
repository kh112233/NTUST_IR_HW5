FT  22 FEB 94 / Algerian printers threaten strike
Printers who produce most of Algeria's newspapers yesterday threatened an
unlimited strike, a new blow to a press already suffering from tougher
censorship and the murder of journalists, AP reports from Algiers.
Employees at the state-run printing centre said the military-backed
government, which has cracked down on the press since seizing power two
years ago, had failed to seek a settlement after strike notice was issued on
Jan. 17.
Islamic gunmen have recently targeted journalists. At least nine have been
killed, including one foreigner, a freelance French TV cameraman last month.
