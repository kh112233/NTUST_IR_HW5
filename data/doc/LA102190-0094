WHEN A CHILD HAS 3 'PARENTS,' WHEN DOES THE CONTRACT END AND REARING BEGIN? 
In the matter of the surrogacy case now in the process of being decided, it 
seems to me a very basic question has not been addressed: For what purpose did 
Mark and Crispina Calvert go to such extraordinary lengths to have a child? The 
answer seems obvious: They truly wanted it to love, nurture to adulthood and 
provide a loving environment. 
That same basic question must be asked of Ms. Anna L. Johnson. 
She already has one child of her own. At any time she could have one or more 
children if she so chooses. 
Then why would she go into a surrogacy agreement? She had already experienced 
carrying a child for nine months and giving birth. She knew what kinds of ties 
this experience brings. The only possible answer to her motivation then seems 
to be the money she would receive. 
A child is entitled to a life with parents who sincerely want offspring, not 
for any monetary gain, but simply for experiencing the joys (and also the 
awesome responsibilities) of parenthood. 
If Ms. Johnson receives the agreed amount of money to which the contract 
entitles her, then she has no further claim on the Calverts.
