IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
TELESCOPE PLANNED FOR CLEAR-SKIED ANTARCTICA 
Every cloud has a silver lining. 
Astronomers from Australia and the United States said last week that they plan 
to build a large telescope atop an icy plateau near the South Pole, in part 
because the ozone hole over that continent would allow better viewing of the 
universe. 
"The advantages are great," said astronomer John Storey of the University of 
New South Wales. "The atmosphere (there) is very stable and very thin, and star 
images are very sharp. There are long periods of darkness during which 
astronomers could study stars." 
And, for at least three months of the year, from October through December, the 
stratosphere over Antarctica contains as little as half the normal amount of 
ultraviolet light-absorbing ozone -- a fact that would facilitate observing the 
universe in wavelengths that are normally obscured by the Earth's atmosphere. 
The ozone hole is caused by man-made chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, 
which are used as refrigerants and solvents. When sunlight returns to the 
Antarctic after the long polar winter, it triggers a massive destruction of 
ozone by the chemicals.
