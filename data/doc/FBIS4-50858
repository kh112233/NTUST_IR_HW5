  [Text] Taipei, May 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan Power Company said 
Friday [20 May] that it will not build a fifth nuclear power 
plant because no more adequate sites exist in Taiwan. 
  The company is currently in the construction planning stages 
for Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant, which is scheduled to 
be entirely equipped and completed by 2006. 
  In order to meet the rising demand for electricity island 
wide, Taipower said it has been working to develop solar, wind, 
and tidal energy sources. 
  Meanwhile, Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said the 
government would prefer not to use nuclear power, but that the 
three extant nuclear power plants were built in accordance with 
the energy diversification policy set by prior administrations. 
  Currently, there are a total of 57 power plants in Taiwan 
capable of generating 19.315 million kilowatts of electricity. 
About 30 percent of Taiwan's energy comes from coal, 26.6 
percent from nuclear plants, 24.7 percent from diesel fuel, 13.3 
percent from hydro power, and 5.3 percent from natural gas, 
Chiang said.
