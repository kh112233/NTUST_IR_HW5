P.M. BRIEFING; 
NEW YORK PASSES TOUGH VDT LAW 
The City Council has approved legislation to protect the health and safety of 
more than 12,000 city workers who use video display terminals. 
The bill is the toughest VDT law in the nation and the first law of its kind in 
a major city, according to the New York City Video Display Terminal Coalition 
of labor unions and occupational safety and health groups. 
The bill, approved Tuesday, mandates that VDT operators at city agencies be 
given a 15-minute break whenever they are required to work at a terminal for 
more than two consecutive hours. 
Under the law, VDT workers with certain medical conditions -- including 
pregnancy -- would be allowed to obtain transfers. Some studies have suggested 
prolonged VDT exposure increases risk of miscarriage.
