  [Text] South Africans should know by this afternoon, an 
entire week after the election, what the final results are. In 
a communique issued late last night the Independent Electoral 
Commisison said the tallies for both the national and provincial 
legislatures would be out by 2 o'clock. 
  But there is still a major hitch with unconfirmed reports 
indicating that the KwaZulu/Natal election may have to be 
reheld. This follows recommendations by the IEC that voting 
north of the Tugel River be declared null and void because of 
large-scale electoral fraud. 
  Echoing this call the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] premier 
candidate for the province, Dr. Frank Mdlalose, suggested that a 
voter's role be used to eliminate any irregularities. The 
controversy surrounding vote counting irregularities will come 
under the spotlight today when President F.W. de Klerk and the 
president elect, Nelson Mandela, meet in Cape Town to discuss 
the new cabinet.
