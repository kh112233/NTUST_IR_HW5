FT  05 JAN 93 / Loyalist paramilitaries reject SDLP talks offer
LOYALIST paramilitaries in Northern Ireland last night rejected an offer of
talks with nationalists amid fears of an escalating murder campaign against
Roman Catholics.
The banned Ulster Freedom Fighters, one of the Protestant groups involved in
a wave of sectarian shootings, said it was not prepared to sit down with Mr
Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the predominantly Catholic SDLP and MP
for Newry and Armagh.
Mr Mallon had challenged loyalist gunmen to meet him after the Ulster
Volunteer Force claimed responsibility for the first serious terrorist
attack of 1993 - the murders of a Catholic father and son near Dungannon, Co
Tyrone.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday: 'We will
bring quite impartially the full force of the law - the army supporting the
RUC - against people of whatever persuasion who use violence for political
ends.'
He rejected holding any negotiations with those who used violence for
political ends. 'If violence is abandoned, disavowed, forsworn, set behind
them by the IRA, and they give us sufficient time to see that that is for
real, and that they mean it, then people will talk to them,' he told BBC
Radio 4's Today programme.
He said he believed a debate was under way in the IRA and its political wing
Sinn Fein and many realised they could not win through violence.
Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein and a former MP, said that if Sir
Patrick was serious about peace he should initiate a dialogue.
'The Sinn Fein view is quite clear,' he said on BBC Radio 4's The World at
One programme. 'There should be a demilitarisation of the situation.' He
added: 'Mayhew has to start peace talks. It is as simple as that.'
