ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
UNEMPLOYED: Stride, the free-lance, drug-sniffing English cocker spaniel, is 
back home in Orange after trying out to be Berkeley's first police dog. . . . 
The Berkeley City Council wanted a drug hound that was friendly and 
unintimidating, but Stride's $10,000 price tag proved intimidating indeed. . . 
. "He's worth every penny of it," insists Stride's owner/trainer, Fred 
Kjorlien. 
"He's a sweetheart. All he does is find dope." . . . But the job went to a 
Labrador retriever. Kris Lindgren and Dean Takahashi
