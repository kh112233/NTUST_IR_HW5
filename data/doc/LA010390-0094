Anabolic steroids may have a greater effect on the mind than the body of 
athletes, a British television documentary says. 
"QED: The Steroid Myth" presents evidence from the United States, Britain and 
Italy challenging the view that the physical effects of steroids can turn good 
athletes into world champions. 
"The idea that steroids enhance performance may be another damaging myth," the 
program, scheduled for airing today on British Broadcasting Corporation, 
concludes. 
To support this point, the program cites evidence at the University of New 
Mexico at Albuquerque, where a group of male athletes were tested for nine 
weeks. 
All were injected with a variety of treatments, including steroids and placebos 
-- substances that have no medical effect and are used merely as a testing 
device. 
According to the university's Dr. Douglas Crist, there was "no statistical 
significant change in body fat . . . no statistical significant change in 
muscular power." 
Nevertheless, the athletes reported that they felt stronger.
