FT  07 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Infant formula like the real
thing
ALGAE is proving the answer to finding an infant milk formula which is as
close as possible to breast milk.
Powdered baby milk lacks a long-chain fatty acid called docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) which is the primary structural lipid in human brain tissue. So far
there has been no satisfactory source of DHA available to the manufacturers
of infant formula - one of the few sources is fish oil, but this contains
other fatty acids which can retard infant growth.
Martek Corporation, of Columbia, Maryland, has found a way of extracting the
compounds from an algae which has a biomass comprised of 35 per cent DHA.
The resulting orange oil is extremely stable and, say the producers, has
generated enormous interest among companies producing infant formula.
