FT  01 MAY 91 / Rocard displays diplomatic flair in New Zealand
MR MICHEL ROCARD leaves New Zealand today after a pilgrimage in which he
apologised for the wrong done to New Zealand by France for the bombing of
the Greenpeace vessel, Rainbow Warrior.
On other matters he was far from conciliatory, however. He remained adamant
that France would continue to test nuclear weapons in the Pacific, and told
business and farming leaders that France would not be pushed faster than it
wanted in lowering protective barriers for agricultural products.
In a hectic three-day visit, the first by a European prime minister since
Harold Macmillan in 1958, Mr Rocard was seen to court unpopularity at home
by his willingness to shoulder French responsibility for the Rainbow Warrior
affair and later problems surrounding the captivity of the French agents
responsible in the Pacific. Mr Rocard personally set up the friendship
cultural exchange programme being funded by a Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.1m)
donation from France as recommended by the United Nations tribunal which
mediated in the dispute that ensued. Talks with Mr Jim Bolger, the New
Zealand prime minister and other leaders were harmonious. Mr Rocard showed
determination to strengthen French influence in the Pacific as a counter to
Japan.
Spokesmen said afterwards that New Zealand attempts to move Mr Rocard on the
topic of nuclear testing got nowhere.
He repeatedly emphasised that the tests posed no threat to the region, and
France wished to maintain an independent nuclear deterrent. He said it was a
'weird idea that France should get rid of the one thing that kept war away
from us'. Mr Bolger said that New Zealand would much prefer France to carry
out the tests at home in Europe. Most of Mr Rocard's appearances were marked
by anti-nuclear protests.
He also spoke to a gathering of business leaders in which he sharply
criticised the Cairns group of agricultural exporting nations, to which New
Zealand belongs, as 'extreme' in its calls for trade reform. He called for
the Gatt negotiations to continue 'in relative silence' to allow some form
of settlement to be reached.
