  [Text] Taipei, Nov 29 (CNA) -- Delegates from an 
environmental group Monday [29 November] suggested that Taiwan 
immediately stop the trade of rhinoceros, tigers and their 
products. 
  A three-man delegation of the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) made the remark during a 
visit with Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of the Council of 
Agriculture (COA). 
  Lin Shiang-nung, COA vice chairman, explained Taiwan's 
wildlife conservation efforts to the CITES delegation and 
discussed the enforcement of Taiwan's wildlife protection law. 
The delegation was also shown a videotape introducing Taiwan's 
wildlife conservation efforts. 
  Sun said that he will arrange for the delegates to visit 
Chinese herbal medicine shops, hold seminars with local 
environmental groups and observe customs methods of cracking 
down on the illegal trade of the endangered animals. 
  The delegation will help Taiwan in the registration, 
management, and product inspection of rhino horns, he said. 
  The delegation, including Frank Antrim from CITES mangement 
authority, Judy Mills from Trade Record Analysis of Flora and 
Fauna in Commerce (Traffic International) and Art Lazarowitz 
from the US Fish and Wildlife Service, arrived here Monday and 
will stay until 2 December.
