 Notice.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of limited field of use co-exclusive worldwide
licenses to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Applications Number 07/073,685 filed on July 15, 1987
and Number 07/547,336 filed on July 20, 1990, entitled ``Second Generation Monoclonal Antibodies Having Binding
Specificity to TAG72 and Human Carcinomas and Methods for Employing the Same'', to Centocor, Inc., having
a place of business in Malvern, PA, and to Miles, Inc., having a place of business in Tarrytown, NY. The patent rights
in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America. 


The antibodies covered in this patent application have a higher binding affinity and specificity to a tumor associated
glycoprotein (designated TAG72) than previous monoclonal antibodies available against TAG72. The
current antibodies also exhibit binding specificity to more human carcinomas than the previous monoclonals, while
maintaining essentially no specificity to normal adult human tissues. 
The prospective co-exclusive licenses will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35
U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective co-exclusive licenses may be granted unless, within 60 days from the date
of this published Notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the licenses
would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
The field of use would be limited to 

in vitro 

non-radioimmunodiagnostic assays utilizing TAG72 antibody.

ADDRESSES:

 Requests for a copy of this patent application, inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated
license should be directed to: Dr. Judith Plesset, Office of Technology Transfer, National Institutes of Health,

of the patent application. Properly filed competing applications for a license filed in response to this notice will
be treated as objections to the contemplated license. Only written comments and/or application for a license which
are received by the NIH Office of Technology Transfer on or before November 15, 1994 will be considered.
