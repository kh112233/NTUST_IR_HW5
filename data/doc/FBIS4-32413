  [Text] Bratislava, June 23 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
will approve an agreement on the support and mutual protection 
of investments with the Czech Republic [CR] in the near future, 
Slovak Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus told CTK today. 
  He said the agreement could be signed before the autumn 
elections, to be held on September 30 and October 1. 
  "We have prepared almost 30 agreements of a similar 
character, not only with the Czech Republic, and we are 
interested in bringing them quickly into effect," Filkus said. 
  The Czech Government approved the agreement on the mutual 
support of investments on Wednesday [22 June]. Czech Finance 
Minister Ivan Kocarnik said the text of the agreement had been 
discussed with the Slovak side, which had agreed with it. The 
text of the agreement proceeds from the fact that the 
contractual parties are states which formerly composed a 
federation. 
  The agreement, which was discussed before the Czechoslovak 
Federation split (on 1 January 1993), never came into effect 
because it was never debated by the Czech parliament nor 
ratified by the Czech president, Kocarnik said.
