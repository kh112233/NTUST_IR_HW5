FT  29 MAY 93 / Heads issue threat over league tables
HEAD TEACHERS are threatening the government with legal action if it carries
out plans to publish league tables based on schools' performance in the
national curriculum tests in England and Wales.
Tests for 14-year-olds are due to start on June 7 but have been boycotted by
the three largest teachers' unions. The National Association of Head
Teachers has said this would make league tables meaningless and it has
advised its members not to help in providing results.
Mr David Hart, the association's general secretary, also objects to league
tables of A-level and GCSE results, which were published for the first time
last year and contained several errors.
In a letter to Mr John Patten, the education secretary, Mr Hart said: 'The
NAHT has taken legal advice and has been informed that it would be possible
for a governing body to take legal action against your department's
contractors, and the department itself, if errors, which are not the fault
of the school, are published in respect of the 1993 GCSE and A-level
examinations and national curriculum results.'
Mr Patten refused to comment on the threat of legal action. The Department
for Education said this was 'hypo-thetical'. It said most errors last year
were the fault of schools, not the department.
