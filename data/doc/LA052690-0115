750 EVACUATED AFTER TRAIN DERAILS, TANKER EXPLODES 
A freight train jumped the tracks and a tanker car carrying grain alcohol 
exploded, sending a fireball skyward and prompting the evacuation of 750 people 
because of fears that the toxic cargo might ignite. 
Fifteen of the train's 90 cars derailed late Thursday, authorities said. 
Evacuees who spent the night at Red Cross shelters established at nearby 
schools began returning home by Friday morning. 
The cause of the derailment was being investigated.
