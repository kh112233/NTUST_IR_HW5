FT  15 OCT 92 / Hussein of Jordan visits Cairo
KING HUSSEIN of Jordan yesterday paid his first visit to Egypt in more than
two years, signalling its return to the Arab mainstream.
Ostensibly, the Jordanian monarch flew to Cairo to offer condolences for
victims of Monday's earthquake, but his mission had a broader significance.
It effectively marks the end of the king's isolation in Arab councils. He
had been ostracised by fellow moderate Arab rulers incensed at Jordan's
support for Iraq in the Gulf crisis.
King Hussein - the Arab world's longest-serving leader - has been edging
back towards the Arab mainstream for some months. His 'rehabilitation' was
accelerated by his recent struggle with cancer and the sympathy it
engendered among his brother-Arabs.
Both President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia sent
personal emissaries to the Jordanian monarch's bedside to wish him a speedy
recovery from the cancer which resulted in the loss of one of his kidneys.
During his brief stay in Cairo, the king discussed with Mr Mubarak regional
issues, including current efforts to advance the peace process.
