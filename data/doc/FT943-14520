FT  14 JUL 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Why I holiday in UK
As the British make their annual summer pilgrimage to the beaches of Spain,
France and Greece, they leave behind a country increasingly popular with
tourists from elsewhere.
Britain is the world's sixth largest earner of tourist revenues. Last year,
a record 19.3m overseas visitors spent Pounds 9.1bn in the UK.
The conventional view is that foreign visitors come to the UK for its
historical and cultural attractions. A new set of marketing guides*
published by the British Tourist Authority reveals a more complex picture.
Australians and New Zealanders find British castles, gardens and historic
houses appealing. Greeks, on the other hand, have no interest in such
attractions; they visit the UK to shop, learn English - or undergo surgery.
The BTA's 26 guides show that UK hotels and tour organisers need to adapt
their marketing to the country in which they are trying to sell their
services.
Belgian visitors like golfing, walking and cycling when they visit the UK.
Norwegians like canal cruising. Argentines want to watch rugby.
Visitors from Hong Kong do not like to walk. They enjoy pageantry but do not
like rain. Many Israeli visitors to London go to the theatre every night.
Top attractions for Indian and Pakistani visitors are Madame Tussaud's and
the Tower of London. Although a large proportion of Indian and Pakistani
visitors come to the UK on business or to see friends and relatives, there
are increasing numbers of young, financially independent tourists from the
two countries.
Visitors from France tend to come to the UK to find eccentricity and cosy
pubs.
