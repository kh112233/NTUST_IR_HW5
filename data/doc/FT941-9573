FT  14 FEB 94 / International Company News: Air New Zealand profit up 45%
Air New Zealand has reported a 44.6 per cent rise in net profit to NZDollars
88.1m (USDollars 50.5m) for the six months to December 31. The directors
said they were satisfied as the result had occurred in 'far from buoyant'
domestic and international trading conditions.
They said the group had benefited from favourable fuel and interest costs
and tax offsets. 'The company is making solid progress to the kinds of
earnings levels expected of the business operating in the traditional risk
area of aviation,' the chair-man, Mr Bob Matthew, said.
Air New Zealand is 35 per cent owned by Brierley Investments, while Qantas
of Australia has 20 per cent and Japan Air Lines 5 per cent.
The managing director, Mr James McCrea, said the first half saw encouraging
growth in tourism. Total passengers carried on international routes rose by
9.3 per cent, reflecting the start of new services to South Korea in
November, additional Taiwan and Bangkok flights and new capacity on Pacific
and Australia to New Zealand routes.
Mr McCrea said the withdrawal of Continental Airlines from the Pacific in
late October coincided with an overall lift in demand on all the sectors it
had previously flown.
He said that the improvement in earnings in the first half of the year had
been driven almost entirely by growth in passenger numbers and higher load
factors. The company's international cargo operations were enjoying higher
tonnages helped by an improvement in the New Zealand economy.
The directors said that the second-half of the year had begun satisfactorily
but earnings would probably be lower than those of the first half.
