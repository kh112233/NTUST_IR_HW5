  [Text] The pressure is on to use military force in the 
wake of the massacre that occurred in Sarajevo last weekend and 
resulted in the death of 68 people. At Turkey's initiative, the 
Islamic Conference Organization [ICO], which is composed of 52 
Islamic countries, is calling on the UN Security Council to 
convene an urgent meeting today in order to lift the arms 
embargo against the Bosnian Muslims. 
  Ambassador Inal Batu, Turkey's permanent UN representative, 
held a news conference in New York where he said that the ICO 
communique will be delivered to the UN and NATO secretaries 
general and to the UN Security Council president today. 
Ambassador Batu pointed out that the communique expresses the 
ICO countries' reaction to the latest incidents in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He added that the letters sent by President 
Demirel and Foreign Minister Cetin to the presidents and foreign 
ministers of NATO member countries have been delivered to UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali as UN documents.
