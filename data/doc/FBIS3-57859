  [Text] Britain is to re-establish military contacts with 
South Africa this month with the visit of a Royal Navy warship 
and support vessel. 
  The goodwill visit will also help boost Britain's chances of 
selling military hardware as naval equipment is high on the 
South Africans' shopping-list. 
  HMS Norfolk, the first of the Navy's most up-to-date Type 23 
frigates, and its support vessel Royal Fleet Auxiliary Grey 
Rover will visit Cape Town and Simonstown from January 27 to 31. 
  The visit follows an invitation by the chief of the South 
African Navy, Vice-Admiral Robert Simpson-Anderson. 
  A United Nations ban on military contacts with South Africa 
was lifted last October, reflecting the government's commitment 
to end white rule. 
  And it is expected that sanctions preventing the sale of 
military equipment to South Africa will be lifted following 
elections in April. 
  UK Defence ministers and officials have been holding 
discussions with the South African government and the ANC 
[African National Congress] in preparation for the lifting of 
the embargo. 
  The British government and defence industry can see 
significant opportunities for sales of military equipment. 
  There is keen interest in buying naval equipment including 
offshore patrol craft, maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters 
because of concern about piracy around the South African coast.
