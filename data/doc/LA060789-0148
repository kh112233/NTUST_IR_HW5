P. M. BRIEFING; 
BRITAIN SELLS AIRCRAFT, MISSILE FIRM 
The government said today it would sell Short Brothers Ltd., the ailing Belfast 
aircraft and missile maker, to the Canadian aerospace company Bombardier Inc. 
for 30 million pounds, about $47 million. 
The announcement ended months of speculation over who would buy the state-owned 
company, which is Northern Ireland's largest employer, after the government 
said it planned to privatize it. 
The Northern Ireland Office said the government will inject 372 million pounds 
($584 million) into Short Brothers and write off a 390 million-pound ($612 
million) loan it made to Short earlier this year to help the company pay its 
debts. 
"Bombardier recognizes the important position occupied by Shorts in the 
Northern Ireland economy and intends to acquire the company as a long-term 
investment and to maintain it as a complete entity," Northern Ireland Secretary 
Tom King told the House of Commons. But he added that he could not guarantee 
that all workers would keep their jobs. 
Short Brothers' once made biplanes under license for U.S. aviation pioneers 
Orville and Wilbur Wright.
