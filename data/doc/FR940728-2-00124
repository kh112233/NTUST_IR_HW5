SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) 25 U.S.C. 2701 

et seq., 

was signed into law on October 17, 1988. The IGRA established the National Indian Gaming Commission (the Commission).
Section 2710 of the IGRA authorizes the Commission to approve class II and class III tribal gaming ordinances. Section
2710(d)(2)(B) of the IGRA as implemented by 25 CFR 522.8 (58 FR 5811 (January 22, 1993)), requires the Commission to
publish, in the 

Federal Register

, approved class III gaming ordinances.



The IGRA requires all tribal gaming ordinances to contain the same requirements concerning ownership of the gaming
activity, use of net revenues, annual audits, health and safety, background investigations and licensing of key
employees. The Commission, therefore, believes that publication of each ordinance in the Federal Register would
be redundant and result in an unnecessary cost to the Commission. The Commission believes that publishing a notice
of approval of each class III gaming ordinance is sufficient to meet the requirements of 25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(2)(B).
Also, the Commission will make copies of approved class III ordinances available to the public upon request. Requests
can be made in writing to: National Indian Gaming Commission, 1850 M St., N.W., suite 250, Washington, D.C. 20036.

The Chairman has approved tribal gaming ordinances authorizing class III gaming for the following Indian tribes:






Campo Band of Mission Indians

Colusa Band of Wintun Indians

Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians

Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa/Chippewa Indians

Kootenai Tribe of Idaho

Pueblo of Pojoaque

Santa Rosa Band of Tachi Indians

Squaxin Island Tribe

Tyme Maidu Tribe of the Berry Creek Rancheria

Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma
