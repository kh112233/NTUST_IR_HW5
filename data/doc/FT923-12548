second quarter
GENENTECH, the California-based biotechnology company that was acquired in

Earnings per share were 3 cents, against 10 cents a year ago. Revenues at

company's quarterly revenues. R &amp; D spending totalled Dollars 52.9m in the
same period of 1991.

8 per cent to Dollars 50.4m year-on-year.
Sales of Activase, a genetically engineered heart attack drug, declined from
Dollars 50.4m to Dollars 44.6m because there were no bulk sales to
Genentech's Japanese licensees in the second quarter.
On Wall Street, Genentech's stock price closed Dollars 1 higher at Dollars
32 7/8 .
