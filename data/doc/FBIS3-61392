<F P=106> [Summary of study by economist Teet Rajasalu: "Estonia's </F>
Economy Stabilized In 1993"] 
  [Text] 
  Estonia's economy passed its lowest point of the last 
few years in the Spring of 1993, but stability of the economy 
was reached by the end of the year. By 1995, real growth of the 
economy could start, wrote economist Teet Rajasalu in his study 
"Estonia's Economy For the Year of 1993." What follows is an 
abbreviated version of the chapter dealing with the balance of 
economic development and the condition of its primary markets, 
along with projections for the next two years to come. 
  Thanks to the monetary reform and current economic policies, 
Estonia's economy has reached a balance for the most part. The 
trade is balanced, inflation stabilized. 
  The growth of unemployment has been stopped and, even if 
this 
summer's drop in unemployment turns out to be a seasonal 
phenomenon, one can presume, at least, that the growth rate of 
unemployment has been slowed down for the time being. 
  The ratio of foreign trade (including services) and the 
current ratio of payments are pretty much balanced out. 
  Estonia's monetary market is characterized by a steady 
growth 
of assets backing the kroon, accompanied by some monetary 
expansion. Interest rates are coming down, and credit resources 
are increasing. 
  Only the credit market is still clouded by confusion 
stemming 
from foreign loans, on one hand, and changes in ownership 
relations and the emerging markets for securities and 
privatization securities, on the other. 
<H5>  Low Purchasing Power Balanced the Market </H5>
  Estonia's trade had already balanced itself during the first 
half of 1992. This was a result of rapidly increasing prices, 
and a relatively slow growth of profits. By the middle of 1993, 
the purchasing power of an average salary had increased to 38 to 
40 percent of the fourth quarter, 1989 level. It was the low 
purchasing power of the population that helped balance out the 
supply and demand on the market of consumer goods. 
  A significant role in balancing the trade market was also 
played by increasing imports. Thus, the import of food items for 
the first three quarters of 1992, at prevailing prices, was 
rated at 27 to 35 million kroons, from where it went to over 200 
million kroons for the fourth quarter, and to 293 million kroons 
for the first quarter of 1993. Thus, the value of imported food 
items has grown close to 10 times, while the actual increase in 
volume, at comparable prices, should be somewhat smaller.

  Last year, Estonian producers competing on the marketplace 
were protected by the lower prices of domestic goods. Due to 
inflation, most goods are gradually reaching the price level of 
imported goods. Inflation taking place up until now has been 
mostly on the supply side and brought about by increased 
production costs. The greater the number of goods, whose prices 
are in competitive balance with those of imported goods, the 
less of a chance there is for any further price increases or 
inflation. The danger of driving the domestic goods out of the 
marketplace, however, will be increased. This became evident in 
daily life as far back as 1992, when problems arose with butter 
and its imported substitutes. Over a period of time, cheese and 
eggs have reached the price level of imported goods, with 
sausage products expected to get there soon. Also approaching 
world market levels are prices for pastry products, building 
materials, sanitary equipment, real estate and cars, as well as 
hotel rates and construction fees. 
<H5>  Level of Income Extremely Low </H5>
  The income level of the population is considerably below the 
average level of countries determining world market prices. The 
income level is 10 to 30 times lower than that of the Nordic 
countries or member states of the European Community. The need 
for increased income raises doubts about the government's income 
policy which, in order to curb inflation, restricts the growth 
of income. Also speaking in favor of future income and price 
increases is the fact that Tallinn is becoming the favorite 
shopping place for Finnish tourists, and the additional demand 
created by them is driving the price levels much too high for 
the local population. 
  However, an increase in the income and demand stemming from 
the purchasing power of the population can lead to increased 
consumption of imported goods, without boosting the consumption 
of domestic production. A growth of imports will, on the other 
hand, bring about a drop in domestic production, which will 
cause the income of the population to drop. Income is 
diminishing even without any administrative interference from 
the government. Diminished income reduces the demand for 
imported goods, and the trade ratio will be balanced.

<H5>  Inflation Running at 25 Percent For the New Year </H5>
  One can assume that inflation in Estonia will slow down 
gradually. For 1994, consumer prices are projected to go up by 
roughly 25 percent, and for 1995, somewhere between 15 to 20 
percent. At the same time inflation will remain relatively high 
compared to developed industrial countries, where it is 
anticipated to run at 3 percent for 1993 and 1994. 
  Estonia's inflation rate is kept high by continuing changes 
in the proportion of prices, and the steady movement of prices 
toward world price levels. This process must also take in the 
normalization of the population's income levels, i.e. cost of 
labor, that is part of the wage-price spiral which, through 
increasing production costs, is causing the prices to go up. 
Secondly, it should be considered that the rapid drop in 
inflation up until now is due largely to obsolete technology and 
low depreciation costs, making the normal renewal of assets 
impossible. Not renewing the assets at world market prices, 
however, will bring about a noticeable increase in the 
depreciation levels of assets and prices of finished products. 
  This is why, in Estonia's situation, maximum suppression of 
inflation should not be the prime objective, as that would 
stretch out the period needed for adaptation to world market 
conditions. More feasible would seem to be an economic policy 
that does not put excessive limits on price and income increases 
in the open (effectively competing) sectors of the economy. What 
is significant here is not the rate of inflation as such, but 
making sure that the inflation remain on the supply side, the 
economy be open, the payments balanced, a balance achieved 
between price proportions and the level of income in the closed 
(non-competing) sector of the economy; and also that minimum 
wages and pensions be in a socially equitable proportion to the 
wage level of the open sectors. 
<H5>  The Kroon Not To Be Revalued Soon </H5>
  The population's income could also be raised without upping 
the level of nominal wages, but rather by a gradual revaluation 
of the kroon. This would mean stability for the prices of 
domestic products, a drop in the prices of imported goods, and 
lower inflation, or stopping inflation altogether. In foreign 
trade, too, this would increase both the cost of production for 
import, and the demand for imported goods. 
  To do that, one would first have to give up using a fixed 
rate of exchange. This could, to be sure, reduce confidence in 
the Estonian kroon, and protecting the exchange rate of the 
kroon may prove to be difficult for Bank of Estonia. At the same 
time, it would give a certain freedom of movement in case there 
are any significant changes in the German economy, and the kroon 
linked to the German mark will be revalued excessively or 
devalued, for that matter. Right now, these possibilities are 
legally ruled out. 
  Secondly, implementation of the entire economic policy would 
be concentrated in the hands of Bank of Estonia. By determining 
the exchange rate, it would be implementing both price and 
income policies, and the role of the Pricing Office in 
regulating prices would be reduced. Also changed would be the 
role of the Social Services Ministry in formulating the income 
policy. Good pension laws, wage scales, tax rates, etc. would, 
in the case of stable prices and wages, stay in effect for a 
long time without changing. 
  Even if transition from a fixed exchange rate, to a 
periodically adjustable fixed rate, for example, may some day be 
necessary, it is not expected to take place within the next two 
years. First, the parity reserve of the kroon's purchasing power 
is sufficient to hold out for a couple of years which, even at 
projected rates of inflation, will guarantee a purchasing power 
higher than the exchange rate. Secondly, it is not likely that 
the current government of politicians, and the government 
coalition setting the tone at Riigikogu would give that much of 
a mandate to Bank of Estonia to control and direct the economy. 
Obviously, the government is not willing to limit itself to 
fiscal policy making, and turn the entire monetary policy over 
to the central bank, as is the custom among classical market 
economies. 
<H5>  Balance of Payments Negative For 1995 </H5>
  For the balance of payments, a growth in the trade deficit 
is 
projected. Even though exports are growing significantly, they 
also generate additional income that creates a demand for 
imports. As the imports increase, the trade balance will remain 
negative, despite the growth of exports. The balance of services 
has been positive, so far, and is likely to remain so in the 
future. It is expected that the surplus from services will still 
cover the deficit of the trade balance for 1994. Beginning with 
1995, however, the balance of payments may turn out to be 
negative. 
  As for the capital balance, the situation in undetermined. 
Direct investments of foreigners in Estonia will probably be 
going up in the years to come. In addition to those, there may 
also be portfolio investments, the volume of which has been 
insignificant up until now. Should the privatization procedure 
change, and simple buying of shares in state enterprises opened 
up to both domestic and foreign capital, the chances of 
increasing portfolio investments will also go up. Also not ruled 
out are portfolio investments in foreign countries, especially 
in cases where no effective application for the capital can be 
found locally. 
  Even though possible errors and inaccuracies are 
considerable, in 1994, there should be an increase in the total 
amount of gold and convertible currency reserves, shown as 
negative amounts in the table for the balance of payments. 
During the first 10 months of 1993, the gold and currency 
reserves of Bank of Estonia have increased by more than 2 
billion kroons. The increase in assets backing the kroon is 
projected at 2.4 billion for 1993, and up to 3.8 billion kroons 
for 1994. By 1995, the trade deficit will probably be so large 
that the growth of reserves will either slow down or stop. This 
will also impact the money market and the possible emission of 
currency. 
<H5>  Growth of Exports Continues </H5>
  The projected development of Domestic Gross Product (DGP) 
stems primarily from changes in demand. But ultimately it is 
spending that determines the projection of DGP. According to 
projections, the intensive growth of exports should continue 
during 1994. This increases the volume of production in Estonia. 
The increased volume of operations, will bring about an 
operating surplus, mixed profits from business, and higher 
wages. At the same time, the growth in 1994 will still be 
largely inflationary. Productivity will not go up much. The cost 
of production will assume an ever-increasing significance among 
exporting companies, making it necessary to increase 
productivity and reduce the work force. All this requires 
increasing investments to update production. 
  In the best of cases, one can expect the first significant 
results to show up in 1995. Increases in salaries will continue, 
but productivity will go up also. This way, salary increases 
will have less of an impact on production costs and prices. In 
1995, the purchasing power of wages and the actual volume of 
consumer spending should begin to go up. This brings about 
increased activity on the domestic market which, in turn, will 
cause the volume of producing goods and services to go up. The 
increased activity on the domestic market also increases the 
demand for imported goods. Competition will get keener, some 
domestic producers will be driven out of the market. Motivation 
to reduce production costs will also increase. Along with the 
livening of the economy, investments will grow in both fixed and 
current assets, increasing demand even further.

  According to projections, conditions for economic growth and

1994 would be roughly 30 billion, and for 1995 up to 38 billion 
kroons. Using the June, 1992 prices as a base figure, the value 
of DGP would be 14.2 and 14.6 billion kroons respectively, 
yielding an annual growth of 5 and 3 percent respectively.
