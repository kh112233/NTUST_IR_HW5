FT  03 SEP 92 / Overseas visitors' numbers rise 12%
THE NUMBER of overseas visitors to Britain grew by 12 per cent to 7.8m in
the first six months of this year, according to figures issued by the
British Tourist Authority yesterday. Their total spending also rose by 12
per cent to Pounds 3.2bn.
The picture in June was less encouraging. Tourist numbers, at 1.6m, were 6
per cent higher than in June last year but spending was flat at Pounds 630m.
Tourism last year was affected by the Gulf War, which cut visitor numbers
and spending from 1990.
One of the biggest areas of growth in the first six months of this year was
the US, with 1.5m visitors, up 32 per cent from the same period last year.
The recent weakness of the US dollar means travel has become more expensive
for US citizens, and there are doubts that the first half's growth will be
sustained for the rest of the year.
The number of visits from western Europe reached record levels in the first
six months of the year, up 5 per cent to 4.82m. Travellers from the rest of
the world rose 21 per cent to 1.46m.
