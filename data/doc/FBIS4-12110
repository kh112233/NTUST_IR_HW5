  [Excerpts] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat left Amman 
this morning at the end of a two-day visit to Jordan during 
which he met with His Majesty King Husayn and ranking officials, 
and held talks on the peace process and joint action regarding 
various issues of mutual interest. [passage omitted] 
  PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh also left 
with President 'Arafat. 
  In statements to journalists, President 'Arafat described 
his 
meeting with His Majesty King Husayn yesterday as a blessed, 
positive, and constructive meeting, especially since the talks 
dealt with Jerusalem, which is in our hearts and consciences. 
  He added: We discussed with His Majesty King Husayn ways to 
settle all important issues, and constructive cooperation in the 
economic, security, administrative, and monetary fields. 
  He said it was agreed that the joint committees will be 
immediately activated. 
  Asked about the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and the date 
of 
his meeting with the Israeli prime minister, 'Arafat said: This 
depends on the results of the current talks which have been 
taking place in Cairo for the last two days. 
  He emphasized that the Palestinian side insists that the 
withdrawal be carried out as scheduled on 13 April. He added 
that the Israelis have begun to withdraw from some bases in Gaza 
and Jericho, but there has not been official notification of 
when the withdrawal will be completed in order to deploy the 
Palestinian security forces there. 
  He stressed that the Palestinians want the return of more 
deportees, saying there is no reason to delay their return.
