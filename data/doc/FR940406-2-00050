Title:

 Worker Characterization and Blood-Lead Study of Renovation and Remodeling Workers. (EPA ICR No. 1689.01). This
is a new collection.


Abstract:

 The Residential Lead-Base Paint Hazard Reduction Act, also designated as Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA), became law on October 29, 1992. Section 402(c)(2) of Title IV of TSCA, directs EPA to conduct a study of persons
engaged in various types of building renovation and remodeling activities. The purpose of the study is to establish
the extent to which workers involved in these activities are exposed to lead, or disturb lead and create a lead-based
paint hazard on a regular or occasional basis. The study involves a targeted survey of three categories of renovation
and remodeling workers in two cities, and the collection of venous blood samples from those workers. The categories
of renovation and remodeling workers are: union laborers, union carpenters, and independent non-union contractors.
The two types of data that will be collected are: (1) Worker blood samples that will be chemically analyzed for lead;
and (2) questionnaire data that will characterize the workers and will be used to understand differences in blood-lead
levels. The questionnaire will be administered either by telephone or self-administered and data collected includes
information relevant to lead exposure on: (a) Demographics; (b) work history (both current and long-term); (c) personal
characteristics and habits; (d) non-work activities; (e) medical history; and (f) previous training or knowledge
of lead. 
The EPA will use data resulting from the survey to determine which groups of workers require training, certification
or educational materials. These data will also be used in conjunction with other studies conducted by the Agency,
and may be distributed to other agencies in summary form for use in addressing other requirements of the Act.


Burden Statement:

 Burden for this collection of information is estimated to average .563 hour (40 minutes) per respondent. This estimate
