FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (3): 'Knowledge gap' is
still widening - Education shows only patchy improvement
The world's young people, in the 1990s, live in the shadow of a 'knowledge
gap'.
While it continues to widen, the chances of the young generation in the
developing world being able to help their nations achieve lasting economic
progress remain slight.
The second report on world education, published at the end of last year by
Unesco (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation), provides stark evidence of the gulf in educational provision
between richer and poorer nations.
While many nations are now making real progress, goaded by the improvements
made by the Pacific Rim countries on the back of strong national training
systems, other areas - particularly sub-Saharan Africa - are being left
further behind.
The nine most populous developing nations - China, India, Indonesia,
Nigeria, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mexico and Egypt - last December
demonstrated that they thought increased educational provision was the key
to economic progress, and stemming population growth, by pledging to provide
their children with universal education 'by the year 2000 or at the earliest
possible moment'.
Within the poorer nations, research reveals another 'gap'. In the developing
world, girls are still thought unlikely to contribute economically, and
receive far less education than boys. In many cases their families do not
think it is worth it, thwarting any attempt by the state to improve girls'
chances in life.
Unesco's figures on the school life expectancy - how long a child can expect
to stay in formal education - in different countries make depressing
reading. Africa south of the Sahara and southern Asia suffer the greatest
problems.
In the Saharan nation of Niger, girls can expect to stay 1.4 years in
school, while boys do scarcely better with 2.8. In Guinea, girls can only
expect 1.6 years in school, while in populous Bangladesh, boys receive 5.8
years at school, compared with 4.2 for girls.
In both Niger and Guinea, textbooks are available for less than 30 per cent
of primary school children, and the school year is short.
Comparative figures show that Canadian girls can expect 16.5 years of formal
education (a year more than their brothers). Both boys and girls devote more
than 15 years to formal study in the US.
However, some parts of the developing world now provide as much education as
member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
For example, South Korea educates its children for an average of 13.3 years
 -more than Australia, level with Japan and Sweden, and only slightly behind
the UK. Several Latin American nations now have an educational life
expectancy of more than a decade.
Unsurprisingly, low educational provision has led to illiteracy in later
life, and according to Unesco, most adults in southern Asia and sub-Saharan
Africa are illiterate. The total number of illiterate adults is still
increasing in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arab states, and in southern Asia.
However, the overall 'literacy gap' appears to be declining, as
better-educated children in other parts of the developing world reach
adulthood, and there is some confidence that much of the current disparity -
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa - can be explained by the wide range of
local languages.
In Ethiopia, for example, the education ministry has introduced the use of
four nationality languages - Oromigna, Tigrigna, Sidamigna and Wolaitigna -
in primary schools, rather than the official language of Amharic.
The reform should improve the standards of general education, because
children will be instructed in the language they use at home, but it may be
that overall literacy statistics will prove harder to compute.
While problems with basic literacy and other skills may prevent emerging
generations from providing the 'engine room' of increased economic output
which developing countries need from them, disparities in higher education
may in the short term be even more damaging.
Lack of a developed higher education system critically damages
competitiveness, as it becomes impossible for a nation's industrial and
research and development communities to keep abreast with developments
elsewhere.
Most Latin American and Asian countries now have university enrolment levels
which conform broadly with university entries in the OECD nations - Unesco
reports show that sub-Saharan Africa is now alone in suffering from a
'higher education gap' by comparison with the rest of the world.
Foreign exchange programmes account for a smaller proportion of students
than they did 10 years ago, and most aid for developing countries now comes
through direct aid from banks and funds. Nearly half of this goes to the
Pacific Rim countries, whose education systems have already been extensively
reformed.
As this aid is in the form of loans which will have to be repaid by the
countries which receive it, and much money has been spent on physical
infrastructure and buildings, which create their own recurrent costs, it
seems, still, that nobody has a clear grasp of how the 'gap' in higher
education can be closed.
