THE WORLD; 
ARGENTINE-BRITISH TRADE 
Argentina announced that it has decided to lift financial and trade 
restrictions on imports from Britain that were imposed during the 1982 Falkland 
Islands War. "As of this date, trade between the two nations will be given the 
same general treatment as trade between any other two nations," a statement 
from the Foreign Ministry said. The decision removed a major stumbling block 
toward re-establishing diplomatic relations between the nations, broken during 
the conflict over the islands. Britain had informed the recently inaugurated 
government of President Carlos Saul Menem that it welcomed concrete steps in 
the area of trade to reflect good faith in an eventual restoration of 
diplomatic relations. Britain ended its trade curbs on Argentina in 1985.
