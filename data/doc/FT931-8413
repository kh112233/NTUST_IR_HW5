FT  19 FEB 93 / Technology: Algae play a powerful role - Worth Watching
Algae burnt in power stations could provide cheaper energy than traditional
fossil fuels.
Engineers at the University of the West of England, in Bristol, have cracked
the problem of how to grow the chlorella algae cheaply enough to make power
generation feasible - filtering them from ponds is uneconomical.
They have used a 'Biocoil', a five-metre high vertical tube in which the
algae circulates, harnessing sunlight for photosynthesis. Sewage has proven
a particularly effective nutrient for the algae. The carbon dioxide produced
when the algae are burnt is redirected to help new algae grow, preventing
the emission of greenhouse gases.
The first power station could be in use within 18 months. University of the

A novel fuel, which could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 per cent, is
now propelling buses in Canberra, Australia. Diesohol is a blend of diesel
(84.5 per cent), hydrated ethanol (15 per cent) and emulsifier (0.5 per
cent). The breakthrough, according to developers Apace Research, is the
emulsifier, which helps the diesel and ethanol mix. Apace Research:
