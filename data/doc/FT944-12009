FT  03 NOV 94 / Food group's offices raided in pirated software inquiry
Investigators checking allegations of illegal computer software use have
raided the UK offices of a number of subsidiaries of Nutricia, the Dutch
foods group, including the baby foods maker Cow &amp; Gate. Unigate, the UK milk
producer, has a 34 per cent stake in Nutricia.
The Business Software Alliance, which represents the world's leading
personal computer manufacturers, secured a High Court writ leading to an
order which enabled its investigators to search the offices of Cow &amp; Gate,
Galenco and Nutricia Dietary Products.
The search took place in the past few weeks after claims that pirated
software was being used. Under software protection laws, penalties can
include prison sentences of up to two years for executives of offending
companies.
It is understood that the organisation queried the legality of software
being used on between 100 and 200 personal computers found at Cow &amp; Gate.
The company has until Friday this week to produce licences for all the
software being used on its premises.
The software companies involved in the complaint, Adobe, Lotus, Microsoft
and the networking company Novell are seeking injunctions preventing the
companies from infringing their copyright and demanding that all copied
software be handed over.
The software alliance rarely presses for the full legal penalties to be
exacted but will be looking for damages for lost revenue. It is more
concerned to persuade companies to obey the law than to send executives to
jail.
It has become increasingly aggressive in recent months, however, in pressing
for action against companies which make use of illegal software, arguing
that nobody should now be in ignorance of the law.
It says that losses exceeded Pounds 300m last year in the UK industry alone.
