<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive world-wide license to
practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Application SN 07/617,910, entitled ``Cell Stress Transcriptional
Factors'' to StressTech Biomedical, Inc. of San Francisco, CA. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned
to the United States of America.



The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. It is anticipated that this license will be limited to the fields of commercial screening assay
services and kits provided to third parties. This prospective exclusive license may be granted unless within 60 days
from the date of this published notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant
of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.

The patent application is based upon the observation that activation of heat shock proteins in an organism indicates
elevated or environmental temperatures or a variety of other environmental stresses. Activation involves binding
of a heat shock factor (HSF) to heat shock elements (HSE) and consequent transcription of heat shock genes. This method
for detecting the accumulation of HSF in the nucleus of stressed cells involves novel activators for 

Drosophilia

 and human HSF, polynucleotides encoding those activators, and antibodies to natural and recombinant DNA. The method
may also be used to monitor and diagnose the effects of abnormal stresses, including disease, on cells.

ADDRESSES: 

Requests for a copy of this patent application, inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated
license should be directed to: Mr. Steven M. Ferguson, Technology Licensing Specialist, Office of Technology Transfer,
National Institutes of Health, Box OTT, Bethesda, MD 20892. Telephone: (301) 4967735; Facsimile: (301) 4020220.
A signed Confidentiality Agreement will be required to receive a copy of the patent application. Applications for
a license in the indicated exclusive fields filed in response to this notice will be treated as objections to the grant
of the contemplated license. Only written comments and/or applications for a license which are received by NIH within
sixty (60) days of this notice will be considered.
