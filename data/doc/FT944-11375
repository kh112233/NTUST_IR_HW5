FT  07 NOV 94 / Scott extends Iraq arms inquiry
Lord Justice Scott is investigating defence contracts linked to the
controversial Al Yamamah defence package with Saudi Arabia as part of his
arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
Among the contacts with Saudi Arabia being examined is one involving a
British defence company. Whitehall documents made available to the inquiry
show that a contract with the company for the supply of shells may have been
re-routed to Iraq in breach of official government guidelines.
The judge's efforts to establish whether Saudi Arabia was being used as a
diversionary route are believed to have been hampered by the lack of
conclusive evidence among thousands of Whitehall documents which have been
made available to him.
It emerged earlier this year that Saudi Arabia was under no obligation to
give details of the end-users of defence equipment supplied by the UK under
the Al Yamamah deal.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, then defence procurement minister, said in reply to a
written parliamentary question that defence exports under the deal had
'Crown status' in common with all government defence exports and were
'therefore not subject to export licensing requirements'.
Mr Mark Thatcher, son of Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, has
been linked to the Al Yamamah deal but the judge does not plan to call him
as a witness. Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, secretary to the Scott inquiry,
said: 'No evidence made available to us links Mark Thatcher to Iraq.'
The apparent loopholes in the UK licensing regime are believed to be one of
the factors prompting the judge to seek proposals for reform of Britain's
export procedures.
The first and only part of the judge's final report to be completed so far
is one covering the UK's export control system, which the judge considers
questionable both in terms of efficiency and democratic accountability.
He has sent copies of this section of his report to the Department of Trade
and to Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader.
