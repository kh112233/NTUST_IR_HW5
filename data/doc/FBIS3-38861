  [Text] The International Court of Justice in The Hague has 
ruled in Chad's favor in its border conflict with Libya. The 
ruling means that Libya, which has controllled the disputed 
territory since 1973, must now evacuate the area. Chad and 
Libya have fought two wars over the land, which is the size of 
France and thought to be rich in uranium and oil. 
  In 1990 the two countries agreed to put the issue before the 
International Court, pledging to accept its ruling.
