OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS; 
SELLING THE HUMAN SPIRIT SHORT 
During the decade of the 1980s, the United States spent billions to carry out 
the war in Central America. Thirty thousand Nicaraguans lost their lives. 
We imposed economic sanctions until the economy was reduced to a shambles. We 
mined their harbors in violation of international law, then thumbed our nose at 
the World Court when its decision went against us. Finally, we openly financed 
the political campaign of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
If a country we depended on -- say, Japan -- were to cut us off economically, 
finance terrorist attacks against us and fund one party in an election 
campaign, we would be outraged at the violation of international law and 
treaties. We would hardly call the elections free and fair. 
We should strive for democracy everywhere in the world. But we should define 
democracy and support it with one set of rules. As we seek to gain the trust of 
our children and encourage moral behavior and raise ethical standards, we must 
not let our hypocritical version of democracy in Nicaragua stand as the 
example.
