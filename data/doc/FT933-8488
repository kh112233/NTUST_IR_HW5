FT  16 AUG 93 / World News in Brief: Hijacking ends
The hijacker of a KLM aircraft, who had demanded that the US free a cleric
charged in relation to the bombing of New York's World Trade Centre,
surrendered last night and freed two remaining hostages. All 131 passengers
and five of the seven crew members had earlier been freed after landing at
Dusseldorf.
