  [Text] At about 1700 yesterday, Dinar [National Narcotics 
Directorate] Intelligence Department agents, headed by Dinar 
Director Inspector Publio Fretes, retired, and legally supported 
by Judge Angel Barchini, raided a house at 1937 Mariscal Lopez 
Avenue near President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's residence. 
  The antinarcotics agents thoroughly checked the house with 
the assistance of super [drug-sniffing] dog "Flyn." The dog 
went to a desk in the living room and found three packages 
containing white powder. A "narcotest" confirmed that the 
powder was cocaine hydrochloride (pure cocaine). The packages 
weighed three kg. The agents continued checking the house and 
discovered two .22-caliber rifles, one with a telescopic sight; 
one 7.65-caliber pistol; and one .38-caliber revolver. They 
also discovered $3,500 in allegedly counterfeit bills. 
  The occupant, identified as Roque Maximo Villalba Acevedo, 
31, a married Paraguayan citizen, and his uncle, Wellington 
Acevedo, also a married Paraguayan citizen, were immediately 
detained. Judge Barchini ordered the detention of the two 
alleged traffickers who were taken to the Dinar headquarters 
where they are being held incommunicado. 
  The detainees were talking with two Automotor company 
employees who reportedly went to the house to collect 
installments on seven Hyundai cars that the traffickers 
reportedly purchased about one month ago. The employees were 
released as the judge believe they are not involved in the 
affair whatsoever. 
  The cache, worth almost 100 million guaranies, was allegedly 
shipped by the Santa Cruz Cartel and was allegedly to be 
marketed in our country by the detainees. This raid was not 
easy for the Dinar agents due to the strategic location of the 
"traffickers" house. 
  A second raid, also linked to this case, was carried out at 
a 
building near the intersection of 3 de Noviembre Street and 
Eusebio Ayala Avenue, specifically at the "Villalba Avalos Real 
Estate Company." Maximo Wenceslao Villalba Fernandez, 37, the 
office manager, was interrogated. The office was allegedly 
being used by the "traffickers" for their commercial operations. 
Not a trace of drugs was discovered in the office. 
  To crown the Dinar-legal raid, a lady, allegedly the mother 
of other stock holders of the company, entered the office and 
began a heated argument with another relative over the situation.
