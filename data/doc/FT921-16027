FT  07 JAN 92 / International Company News: Computer piracy costs put at
Dollars 4.5bn
COMPUTER software piracy in western Europe cost US suppliers a
conservatively estimated Dollars 4.46bn in 1990, according to figures
collected by the Software Publishers Association and the Business Software
Alliance.
The two organisations represent the world's large personal software
companies, most of which are US-based. Their estimate of losses from piracy
are made by comparing the number of units of software sold in the year with
the number of personal computers sold.
Typically, only a fraction of a software package is apparently sold for each
personal computer, presenting compelling evidence of widespread piracy. In
Italy, for example, one of the worst offenders, only half a software package
was sold for each personal computer bought in 1990.
The SPA last year estimated that losses in the US from piracy came to
Dollars 2.4bn in 1990.
The revenues lost in both the US and western Europe has has been expressed
as the wholesale rather than retail value of the software, which explains
why the overall loss is lower than the Dollars 12bn usually quoted as the
worldwide losses experienced by software suppliers.
