LOCKLIN POEM IN BLANK VERSE 
I rise in defense of private, copyright property: for the "text" of Gerald 
Locklin's "Homage to John Cage" is identical with that of my poem, "The Lazy 
Man Says Hello to God" (Christopher's Books). 
I ask you: Is this plagiarism, or is it not? 
I omitted registering my poem with the Guinness Book of World Records as the 
world's shortest. I held off because I saw a logical question whether a poem 
with no words at all could be said to possess extension or duration -- an issue 
which Locklin's non-text raises in alluding to John Cage. Unlike Locklin's 
heavy-handed art object, however, mine was a bona fide expression of its 
fictive protagonist's ruling passion (laziness), which later in the "narrative" 
would prove itself in a haiku only 4-5-3 syllables long.
