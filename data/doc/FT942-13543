FT  25 APR 94 / Beijing frees key dissident
China played a trump card at the weekend when it freed Mr Wang Juntao, one
of the leaders of the pro-democracy protests of 1989, to travel to the US
for 'medical treatment'.
Mr Wang's early release from a 13-year jail sentence was widely interpreted
in Beijing as an attempt by China to improve prospects for renewal of its
privileged trade access to the US market.
President Bill Clinton is required by June 3 to rule on whether to renew
China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. He has made renewal conditional
on 'overall, significant improvement' in China's human rights behaviour.
US officials say China has made progress towards satisfying US criteria for
renewal of MFN but has not gone far enough.
The recent detention of Mr Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent dissident,
was seen as a set-back.
Mr Wang, who was accused of being one of the 'black hands' behind the
Tiananmen protests, was sentenced in 1991. His wife had fought a long
campaign for his release on medical grounds.
He was reported to be suffering from several serious ailments, including
heart disease and kidney problems. He had staged at least one hunger strike
during his jail term.
