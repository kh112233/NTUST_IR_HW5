FULLERTON NARCOTICS AGENTS RENAME YEARLY AWARD TO HONOR SLAIN OFFICER 
Police officer Tommy De La Rosa, slain during an undercover narcotics 
investigation in June, has been posthumously named Narcotics Officer of the 
Year by the Orange County Narcotics Officers Assn. 
The award, presented annually to a police officer who has performed outstanding 
service in the war on drugs, was also renamed The Tommy De La Rosa Award as a 
"further tribute to the fallen officer," the Fullerton Police Department 
announced. 
Fullerton Police Chief Phil Goehring accepted the award at a dinner 
presentation Aug. 9 on behalf of his department and the De La Rosa family, the 
release said. 
De La Rosa, 43, was shot and killed June 21 when he was ambushed by a group of 
alleged drug dealers during a narcotics operation in Downey. Eight suspects are 
awaiting trial on murder charges in connection with his death. 
In 1989, De La Rosa, a 10-year police veteran, was named Officer of the Year by 
the Orange County Chapter of the Latino Peace Officers' Assn.
