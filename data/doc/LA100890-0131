P.M. BRIEFING; 
IMPORTED WORKERS EXIT GERMANY 
The new united Germany is using every available plane to send home Third World 
workers hired by the east's former Communist leaders, officials said today. 
More than 2,000 unwanted Mozambican and Vietnamese workers are returning home 
every week on charter planes from Berlin's Schoenefeld airport. 
"We just haven't got enough planes to cope and are looking for more," said 
Manfred Knack, head of charter sales at Interflug, the flag carrier of the 
former East Germany. 
About 85,000 workers came to East Germany from socialist Third World countries 
under bilateral accords. Germany, which unified last week, has ended the 
agreements, leaving it up to individual companies how long they want to keep on 
foreign workers. 
Germany is offering $2,000 and a flight home to foreign workers, many of whom 
have suffered racial attacks as scapegoats for East Germany's economic 
collapse.
