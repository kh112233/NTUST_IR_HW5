Description of Project:

 The existing project consists of: 
(1) Three storage reservoirs (Lake Alpine, Union Reservoir, and Utica Reservoir) with a combined storage capacity
of 9,581 acre-feet; (2) the Mill Creek Tap; (3) the 0.7-mile-long Upper Utica Conduit; (4) Hunters Reservoir with
a usable storage capacity of 253 acre-feet; (5) the 13.4-mile-long Lower Utica Conduit; (6) Murphys Forebay; (7)
a 4,048-foot-long penstock; (8) Murphys Powerhouse with an installed capacity of 3.6 MW; (9) Murphys Afterbay; and
(10) other appurtenances. 
The applicant proposes to direct a substantial portion of the water now delivered into the Upper Utica Conduit via
the Mill Creek Tap into the Collierville Powerhouse, through the Collierville Tunnel. Both the tunnel and the Collierville
Powerhouse are licensed under Project No. 2409 to the Calaveras County Water District.

Description of Project:

 The applicant is exploring two alternatives for the proposed project. The first alternative would consist of: (1)
Sea Alaska's existing Mellen Lake; (2) a 10-foot-high concrete dam raising the surface elevation of that lake about
8 feet; (3) a 2,600-foot-long, 48-inch-diameter steel penstock; (4) a powerhouse containing an unspecified number
of generating units with a total installed capacity of 2,000 kW; and (5) a tailrace returning water to Reynolds Creek.

The second alternative would consist of: (1) the Haida Corporation's existing Summit Lake; (2) a 10-foot-high concrete
dam raising the surface elevation of that lake about 8 feet; (3) a 2,600-foot-long, 48-inch-diameter steel penstock;
(4) a powerhouse containing an unspecified number of generating units with a total installed capacity of 1,500 kW;
and (5) a tailrace returning water to Reynolds Creek. 
Both alternatives would also include a 10-mile-long transmission line interconnecting with an existing Alaska
Power and Telephone distribution system and other appurtenant facilities. 
No new access roads will be needed to conduct the studies.
