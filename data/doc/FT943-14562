FT  14 JUL 94 / Hutu refugees pour into Zaire
Tens of thousands of Hutu refugees, mainly emaciated women and children,
have begun crossing from Rwanda into eastern Zaire, to flee advancing
Tutsi-led rebels, agencies report.
Aid workers said yesterday they could not cope with the refugees trekking
into a game park north of the Zairean town of Goma. About 10,000 an hour had
streamed across the border and many more were coming. 'It's simply
overwhelming,' one aid worker said.
Zairean officials said they feared as many as 500,000 refugees would cross
the border in the next few days. 'We expect the worst and we are clearly not
ready for it,' a Zairean army major said.
The refugees are predominantly from Rwanda's majority Hutu tribe, whose
militia have killed an estimated 500,000 members of the Tutsi tribe in three
months of carnage.
The Tutsi-led rebels of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) now control more
than two-thirds of the country and are advancing towards the Hutu-held areas
in the west.
Officials at the Goma office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
estimated 100,000 refugees had crossed the frontier but the UNHCR only had
resources for an influx of up to 50,000 refugees.
'It is a humanitarian catastrophe,' said Ms Johanna Grombach, Red Cross
chief in Goma. 'We cannot feed all these people. The medical needs are also
enormous.'
The RPF, set to form a broad-based government in the next few days, stepped
up its bombardment of Ruhengeri, a garrison town 60km from Gisenyi, where
the retreating Hutu government has based itself. One aid worker estimated as
many as 1m refugees - 'a wall of people' - were streaming along the road
from Ruhengeri to Gisenyi.
