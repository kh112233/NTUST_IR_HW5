NATION; 
REPORTER TELLS SOURCE, IS FREED 
A television reporter told a judge the name of a confidential source today and 
was immediately freed from the jail where he had served two weeks of a 
six-month contempt-of-court sentence. 
"I want to see my wife and my son and have a pizza and beer," said KMOL 
reporter Brian Karem, moments after he was freed by Texas District Judge Pat 
Priest. 
Karem was jailed June 27 for refusing to say who arranged a telephone interview 
with jailed capital murder suspect Henry Hernandez. Hernandez and his brother, 
Julian, are charged in the March, 1989, shooting death of a San Antonio police 
officer, Gary Williams. 
Karem today identified the source as Deborah Ledesma, a cousin of the Hernandez 
brothers. 
He said he decided to reveal the name after Ledesma, who now lives in 
California, agreed to relieve him of his promise to protect her identity.
