FT  24 FEB 94 / IMF ready to relaunch special fund
The International Monetary Fund has at last collected enough promises of
money to relaunch its enhanced structural adjustment facility, a special
fund to lend money to low income countries at subsidised interest rates.
The Washington-based institution has gathered SDR4.5bn (Pounds 4.19bn) of
pledges for the ESAF capital account, on which donor countries will receive
interest, and SDR2bn of outright gifts, including SDR600m of its own
capital, for a separate subsidy account used to lower the interest rate
charged to borrower countries to 0.5 per cent.
This is a little short of the IMF's original target of SDR5bn for the
capital account and SDR2.1bn for the subsidy account, but the board has
decided to press ahead and make loans from the new ESAF.
IMF member governments have generally praised the work of the ESAF since it
was set up in 1987, but budget constraints have made it difficult to collect
the money needed to replenish the facility, virtually exhausted by the
authorisation of a SDR606.6m loan to Pakistan earlier this week.
The US promised a Dollars 100m gift in its budget earlier this month and now
Germany, the last major industrial country not to have contributed, has
pledged money for the capital account, though not the subsidy account.
Most countries that qualify for ESAF loans are in sub-Saharan Africa, but
the IMF board yesterday approved the addition of Armenia, Georgia,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Macedonia and Cameroon.
Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, said yesterday he was especially
impressed by the contributions many developing countries have made to the
ESAF. The facility would play an important role in supporting economic
adjustment in francophone West Africa after the devaluation of the CFA franc
in January, he said.
