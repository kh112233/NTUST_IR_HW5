FT  24 OCT 94 / Briton dies in Egypt terrorist attack
A middle-aged British man was killed and three other Britons wounded
yesterday when gunmen opened fire on their tour bus in the town of Naqada,
about 25km north of the tourist centre of Luxor in Upper Egypt.
Witnesses said three men fired at the bus with automatic weapons before
escaping. The shooting fits a pattern of attacks by Islamic militants, who
have mounted 21 raids on tourist boats, buses and other tourism targets
during the past two years, seeking to wreck the industry and put pressure on
the government.
Yesterday's killing is the third of a foreign visitor in eight weeks. In
August Islamic militants killed a Spanish boy in an attack on a tourist bus
in southern Egypt, wounding his father and the Egyptian tour guide. Gunmen
also shot dead two Egyptians and a German tourist and wounded another in a
gun attack in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada in September.
The recent rise in such incidents followed a lull in attacks by the Gamaa al
Islamiyya, the militant group which claims responsibility for the campaign
against tourist targets, and came after claims by the government that they
had smashed the Gamaa's main cells.
The group has also attacked senior officials, policemen and secular
intellectuals who oppose its ideology.
The attacks have come at the start of the main cruise and tour season for
European and North American visitors to Egypt - a season for which the
country's hoteliers, cruise managers and the tens of thousands of others
employed in Egypt's now ailing tourism sector had held high hopes for a
recovery.
Tourist arrivals had improved substantially in July and August on the same
months in 1993. Figures for September are not yet available.
