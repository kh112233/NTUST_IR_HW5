Paperwork Reduction Act

will be subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act. 



Human Subjects 



If the proposed project involves research on human subjects, the applicant must comply with the Department of Health
and Human Services Regulations (45 CFR part 46) regarding the protection of human subjects. Assurance must be provided

applicants. The letter should be submitted to the Grants Management Officer (whose address is reflected in section
B, ``Applications''). It should be postmarked no later than one month prior to the planned submission deadline, (e.g.,
May 17 for June 17 submission). 

The letter should identify the announcement number, indicate the intended submission deadline, name the principal
investigator, and specify the study area addressed by the proposed project.
