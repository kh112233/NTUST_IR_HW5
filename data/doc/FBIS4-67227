Special Services Wage Joint Struggle Against Drug Business"] 
  [Text] Rostov-na-Donu -- In Rostov staffers of the oblast 
administration of the federal counterintelligence service and 
the Turkmenistan national security committee have arrested a 
leader of the drug mafia for whom they were searching. 
  This X, a citizen of Turkmenistan, led a large criminal 
group 
which transported narcotics from Southeast Asia to Central Asia. 
In Rostov the mafioso hoped to lie low and acquire new contacts. 
  Employees of the Rostov counterintelligence administration 
press service believe this operation has been a very successful 
and remarkable one. On the one hand a palpable blow has been 
dealt to the drug mafia and on the other there has been a 
demonstration of the now so rare close collaboration and 
cooperation between the special services of republics of the 
former USSR in the struggle against organized crime.
