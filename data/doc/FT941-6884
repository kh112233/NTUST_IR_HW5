FT  28 FEB 94 / Effort for global ban on land mines
Government experts from 39 nations meet in Geneva this week to consider
proposals for a worldwide ban on the use of anti-personnel mines.
The International Committee of the Red Cross is leading the campaign for an
outright prohibition of these indiscriminate and long-lived weapons which
every month kill about 800 people and maim thousands, mostly civilians.
An estimated 85m-100m uncleared mines lie in more than 60 countries,
including 9m-10m in Afghanistan, 9m in Angola and 5m-10m in Iraq. Another
100m mines are stockpiled around the world.
The carnage inflicted by land mines, often long after a conflict, and the
vast tracts of land they leave uninhabitable, have led to growing support
for a ban or tougher international controls on their use.
The expert group meeting in Geneva, called for by a UN General Assembly
resolution last December, will look at ways to strengthen the UN's 1980
convention to curb use of inhumane conventional weapons. The group is to
present recommendations by the end of the year.
Short of a complete ban, the ICRC wants controls on mine manufacture, for
instance to require self-destruct mechanisms. A mine can be made for as
little as Dollars 3 (Pounds 2), and cost an average Dollars 1,000 to clear.
