  [Text] Zhuhai, February 22 (CNS)--Civil aviation in China 
has to put an emphasis on security of air traffic and stop 
various kinds of incidents this year, the Deputy Director of the 
Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), Mr. Yan Zhixiang, 
said in a meeting on security work within national civil 
aviation. 
  Mr. Yan stressed that such security work this year would be 
carried out strictly with the stress being placed on technology, 
style of work and discipline in respect to flights, cabin 
service and air control. Such strict practice must be 
implemented by various entities and departments within CAAC. 
  Speaking of safety coming first with the stress being placed 
on prevention, Mr. Yan noted that attention should be paid not 
only to development of air services and its scope, production 
management and economic indicators especially under stiff market 
competition, but much more importantly to security, 
administration of air safety and to all safety indicators with 
an all-time emphasis on security work [sentence as received]. 
  Mr. Yan when talking of the system of responsibility for air 
safety stressed that the legal person of a particular enterprise 
had to be held responsible for safety and that the awareness of 
risk should be strengthened. Safety factors had to be given 
prominence and safety procedures had to be strictly carried out. 
Leading cadres had to take the lead in conducting strict 
procedures and no leniency should be given to air crews found 
culpable of wrongdoing during flights. Various relevant 
entities should be accountable for the performance of their 
duties. 
  The meeting was the largest of its kind ever held by the 
national civil aviation sector and was attended by personnel 
from local branches of CAAC, main airports, airliners under the 
direct control of CAAC as well as their branches, flight teams 
and air companies across the country.
