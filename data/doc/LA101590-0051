WOMAN KILLED BY TRAIN IS IDENTIFIED 
A woman struck and killed by a train as she sat on the tracks Saturday in 
Encinitas was identified Sunday by the coroner's office as 20-year-old 
Elizabeth Diane Jones. 
Jones was sitting on the Santa Fe Railway tracks near her home in the 330 block 
of North Vulcan Avenue when she was struck at 6:54 p.m. Saturday by the 
southbound Amtrak train, Deputy Coroner Robert Engel said. 
A friend of Jones, who was seated with her on the tracks, was able to scramble 
to safety and was not hurt, said Sgt. Roy Stamper of the Sheriff's Department. 
Jones, a maid at the Oceanview Motel in Encinitas, was killed instantly, Engel 
said. 
The accident occurred near Old Highway 101 where the train tracks run along a 
residential and commercial area. Authorities have yet to determine how fast the 
train was traveling.
