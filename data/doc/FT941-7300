FT  25 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): ICL's new keyboard aims for
comfort
An ergonomic keyboard designed to improve computer typing comfort has been
introduced by ICL, the UK computer group owned by Japan's Fujitsu. It also
reduces static electricity built up by clothing or low humidity.
Costing Pounds 65, the ErgoPRO 102 keyboard minimises tension and load on
fingers, hands and wrists. Its low front edge and wide range of tilting
angles help users find the best typing posture.
The keys are activated by a light typing pressure and are comfortable and
quiet for fast typing. An extended spacebar means users need not twist or
change wrist position.
