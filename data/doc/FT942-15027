FT  18 APR 94 / Unionist scorns Reynolds offer to share power
A power-sharing proposal by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,
aimed at wooing Ulster's unionists to the idea of a united Ireland has been
dismissed by Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party. It
has also received only a lukewarm reception in the republic.
Mr Reynolds told a Fianna Fail youth conference that he would be prepared to
give a 'personal guarantee' to Northern Ireland's political parties of a 30
per cent participation in a future all-Ireland government. This would in
effect give unionists 20 per cent of seats in an all-Ireland cabinet, and
similar representation in the Irish civil service.
However Mr Molyneaux, speaking from Washington, where he is beginning a
week-long visit to the US, dismissed the proposal as 'totally, totally
unrealistic . . . the greater number of people of Northern Ireland are not
orphans wandering about a barren landscape waiting for somebody to take them
in'.
Mr John Bruton, the leader of the opposition Fine Gael party in the
republic, also criticised the proposal for being a 'diversion' which would
distract attention 'from solving practical problems . . . many things need
to be done in the short term to build up trust'.
Even Mr Reynolds' Labour coalition partners were lukewarm. The party said:
'In principle we are in favour of power-sharing . . . but that is a very
long way down the road and there are an awful lot of bridges that would have
to be crossed before we could get to that point.'
However a spokesman for Mr Reynolds said the Unionist reaction was expected
and the proposal would 'remain on the table to be built upon'. He added: 'Mr
Reynolds felt that if we believe in (a united Ireland) we had better start
saying what it will entail.'
