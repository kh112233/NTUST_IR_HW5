  [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The number of Taiwanese 
tourist arrivals here increased slightly during the first four 
months compared with the same period last year, with the two 
countries gradually restoring relations which have been strained 
since diplomatic ties were severed in 1992, according to the 
Korea National Tourism Corp. (KNTC). 
  A total of 51,600 Taiwanese visited South Korea from January 
to April this year, up 5.4 percent from 49,000 for the same 
period in 1993, according to a KNTC report released Tuesday. 
  The increase, although slight, contrasts sharply with the 
145,300 Taiwanese visitors to Korea in 1993 -- a 50.9-percent 
drop from the previous year's 296,000, the KNTC report said. 
  The KNTC report attributed the rise to an easing of 
anti-Korean sentiments among Taiwanese, which climaxed just 
after Seoul broke diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of 
relations with the communist mainland in 1992. 
  Seoul and Taiwan have since been trying to resume bilateral 
relations, establishing liaison offices in Seoul and Taipei and 
expanding economic cooperation between businesses. 
  The KNTC also sent a delegation to Taipei early this year to 
promote "Visit Korea Year 1994," placing ads in the Taiwanese 
media. 
  Meanwhile, 36,500 South Koreans went to Taiwan during the 
first four months, a 56.7-percent increase from 23,300 during 
the same period in 1993, approaching the level reached before 
the severance of ties, according to the KNTC.
