FT  20 JUL 92 / Asean set to discuss islands dispute
FOREIGN ministers of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean)
converge in Manila today for discussions this week on concrete programmes to
expand regional co-operation.
The meeting takes place against a backdrop of the continuing territorial
disputes involving three Asean members - Brunei, Malaysia and the
Philippines - and China, Vietnam and Taiwan over the Spratly Islands in the
South China Sea. All six countries have claims over the islands.
The disputes could deteriorate shortly with the expected start of oil
exploration in the area.
The meeting is the first since the January accord among the six Asean
governments, which include Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand - to transform
the region into a free-trade area by 2007.
They will discuss ways to strengthen Asean's ability to cope with a changing
international environment and then discuss trends in trade, investment and
development with counterparts from their main economic partners: the EC, US,
Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
Mr Raul Manglapus, Asean standing committee chairman and Philippines foreign
affairs secretary, confirmed yesterday that the Spratly disputes will be
discussed.
China and Vietnam have awarded contracts separately to western companies to
drill for oil in the disputed territories. Vietnam recently increased its
campaign by wooing Malaysia with participation in an exploration venture.
Over the past few weeks, China is said to have planted a territorial marker
on a reef and had authorised its army to use force if necessary to control
the islands.
