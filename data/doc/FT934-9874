FT  09 NOV 93 / Scott probes discrepancy in evidence on Iraq deal
THE SCOTT arms-for-Iraq inquiry is investigating a contradiction in evidence
between a Foreign Office official and his MI6 contact, it emerged yesterday.
The official, Mr Simon Sherrington, told the inquiry that he had not been
aware of key intelligence reports when, in October 1989, he advised Mr
William Waldegrave, then a Foreign Office minister, on sensitive exports.
He advised that lathes made by the Midlands company Matrix Churchill were
not necessarily defence-related and could be justified under the
government's guidelines. Mr Sherrington said he based his advice on
information provided by MI6. But he said he had not seen earlier MI6 reports
which warned that Matrix-Churchill machine tools were being used by Iraq to
produce ballistic missiles.
Mr Sherrington identified his MI6 contact as a Mr O and said he could not
recall any 'adverse comment' from the secret service about his briefing to
the minister.
Mr O's written evidence has not been made available by the Scott inquiry.
But it is said by inquiry officials to suggest that Mr Sherrington
misrepresented the advice given by MI6.
Mr O is to be questioned by Lord Justice Scott in a private hearing later
this week. The dispute between Mr Sherrington and Mr O has renewed the
attention of the Scott inquiry on earlier evidence given by Mr Waldegrave
and the role of Sir Robin Butler, the head of the civil service who as
cabinet secretary is the government official with responsibility for
intelligence and security.
Mr Waldegrave told the inquiry last month that he approved the export of
defence-related machine tools to Iraq in November 1989 because he had not
seen items of key intelligence.
The public hearings have been adjourned until November 22.
