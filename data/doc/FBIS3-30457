  [Text] Budapest, 3 Feb (MTI) -- President of the Russian 
Liberal Democratic Party Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his 
three-member entourage crossed from Yugoslavia into Hungary by 
car at Roszke at 4 a.m. on Thursday [3 February]. They boarded 
a plane for Moscow at Budapest's Ferihegy Airport. 
  National Police Airport Security Service Head Colonel Jozsef 
Balogh said that one of Zhirinovsky's companions carried an 
unloaded gun in his hand baggage. The gun was confiscated 
according to international regulations and given to the plane's 
captain in a steel box. Balogh said the group flew to Moscow 
from Ferihegy-2 terminal by Malev flight 100. 
  He added that when a protected Hungarian politician travels 
abroad, for example, the president or the prime minister, the 
security men accompanying him also hand over their guns to the 
captain, who gives them back upon arrival at the point of 
destination.
