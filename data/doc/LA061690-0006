JANET ADKINS' CONTROVERSIAL ASSISTED SUICIDE 
The ethical issue of euthanasia, whether active or passive, appears to be 
emerging once again and quite possibly on its way to the federal courts with 
the willful death of Janet Adkins. 
Our society accepts without question that living and maintaining someone's 
right to live is the morally correct stance, while assisting a person in a 
medical suicide is considered a killing. 
The oath to do no harm taken by Kevorkian has not, in one sense, been broken 
because the issue in question is whether more harm is coming from death, or by 
forcing a person to live. Are we dealing at all with the emotional and 
psychological harms to the person or only whether the person lives or dies? 
It is time to discard the notion that death must always be the last resort and 
always be considered "bad" and ask ourselves whether there may be more to death 
than simply dying and, conversely, less to life than just living.
