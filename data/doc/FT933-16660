FT  02 JUL 93 / Letter: No vagaries if peat-free
Sir, Peat producers hampered by wet weather this year would suffer less from
the vagaries of the British climate if they switched to making peat-free
composts in future ('Scottish peat profits bogged down by squelchy weather',
June 29).
Fine weather is needed for peat extraction, but not for the production of
adequate substitutes based on plant waste and coconut fibre. Increased use
of these products would reduce the pressure on threatened peat bogs, home to
many rare plants, animals, birds and insects, and also help address waste
disposal problems.
Peat use could be cut by 70 per cent by the end of 1994 if the government
introduced fiscal incentives to support this growing industry. This would
undoubtedly offer compost producers a more secure future than a change in
the weather.
