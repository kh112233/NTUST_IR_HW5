  [Text] Last night a public meeting organized by the 
Estonian Citizens' Union took place at the Nomme people's hall. 
Speaking to a large audience were Riigikogu [parliament] 
members Juri Toomepuu [Estonian Citizens' Union chairman] and 
Peeter Lorents the press service of the Citizens' Union reported 
to ETA [Estonian Telegraph Agency]. Toomepuu spoke about the 
ethical crisis, which according to him is rife in government 
circles, the ensuing waste, and state-owned companies being 
turned into private firms by illegal means and criminal 
incompetence. According to Lorents the government has so far 
still not managed to move from the economy of spending to the 
economy of revenues. A mighty flow of money and resources 
travels in Estonia without any control and taxation, he said. 
  According to the press service of the Citizens' Union, the 
public meeting at Nomme decided to appeal to the Estonian public 
and government in order to voice their dismay with the 
catastrophically declining economic and social policies. At a 
proposal from Toomepuu, it was decided to call to the Riigikogu 
and government to introduce a link between pensions and the 
average wage. Many people of Nomme demanded the government's 
resignation which met with a unanimous support from the whole 
audience.
