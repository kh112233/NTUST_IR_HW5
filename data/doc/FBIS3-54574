  [Excerpts] His Majesty King Husayn has concluded his visit 
to the United States and left for Austria following several 
meetings in Washington, the last of which was with the U.S. 
secretary of state. [passage omitted] 
  The way Jordan thinks about the nature of the conflict, how 
it should be resolved, and the future of the region in light of 
comprehensive peace has been appreciated by the U.S. 
Administration and public opinion. U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher reiterated U.S. appreciation for His Majesty 
King Husayn's leading role in supporting the peace process to 
allow it to achieve its objectives. 
  [Begin recording, in English] [Christopher] I am very 
pleased to welcome here to the State Department His Majesty King 
Husayn. He's a rather frequent visitor of the United States, 
but each time he's very welcome and this time his visit happens 
to coincide with the renewal of the bilateral discussions 
between Jordan and Israel here in Washington with a streamlined, 
though informal, setting. So I think prospects are very good 
for making progress there. I am very pleased by a number of 
developments in the relations between the U.S. and Jordan since 
the last time I met with the king. So in many respects, this is 
a very happy occasion, and, as I always do when I see him, I 
look forward to it by welcoming you here, your majesty. It is a 
great pleasure to have you here. 
  [Husayn] Thank you very, very much indeed, sir, for the warm 
and kind welcome. It is a pleasure to be back in Washington. 
I've had the privilege of meeting with the President and 
meeting with many of my friends, and now this is really a 
wonderful opportunity to be with you, sir. We've seen you in 
the area. We appreciate all the efforts that you've made in the 
cause of our arrival at a just and comprehensive peace in our 
region. And you have our gratitude, admiration, and respect. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] expect to conclude a peace 
treaty with Israel? I represent Israel television. 
  [Husayn] Sir, I hope that we will have started in earnest 
now to discuss all items in the agenda and to cover all these 
subjects. And I believe our approach is the right one to try to 
resolve all the problems that are there and the crowning 
achievement will be a peace treaty [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] Your Majesty: Can you elaborate on what you mean 
by full peace with Israel? 
  [Husayn] Full peace is full peace. It is a peace that 
brings people together, that gives them the opportunities they 
never had, that changes the face of our region as a whole, that 
is our contribution to future regions. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] Israeli to sign, to move 
ahead at all, and not waiting for anybody else. Is Jordan ready 
to move ahead without waiting for anybody else? 
  [Husayn] We are not waiting for anybody, but we hope that, 
as things will move, we will all meet before too long, having 
accomplished our work in establishing the just and lasting peace 
that we have sought for so long. 
  [Reporter] What can you tell us about the talks that are 
taking place in Washington now? Are they making enough progress 
for them to ask the full delegations to come next week? 
  [Christopher] You know, I've just returned from abroad, and 
the talks have just started, so I think it's too early to say, 
but the new format in which the heads of delegations meet under 
streamlined conditions, I think, is very promising, and we'll 
see in a week or so whether or not the full delegations should 
come here. One thing I would emphasize, and that is, I feel that 
real progress can be made in the format that they now have. So 
I wouldn't make judging progress dependent on whether and when 
the full delegations will come here. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Secretary: Jordan seems to be very close to 
an agreement with Israel and I feel that they could have had it, 
if not last year, probably 10 years ago. Do you think that 
Jordan should move ahead and set an example to the Syrian, or 
does the use of the codeword comprehensive mean that you agree 
that Jordan ought to wait for the others and [word indistinct] 
both sign together? 
  [Christopher] You know, the role the United States has in 
these conversations and negotiations is the role of a cosponsor. 
I think the timing is really up to the parties, and I wouldn't 
want to try to impose United States views, with respect to 
timing. What we want to see is steady progress on all fronts, 
and I think the king has given you his indication that they are 
making steady progress on all fronts. So I would not, I think 
it will be too arrogant for the United States to try to suggest 
to the parties a precise timing under which they'll move ahead. 
Steady progress is what we now see. Thank you very much. 
  [Husayn] Thank you sir. [end recording] [passage omitted]
