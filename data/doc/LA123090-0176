FOURTH ANNUAL TRIVIA QUIZ; 
ORANGE COUNTY 1990 
So, you thought you had seen your last pop quiz when you got out of school? 
Wrong! There are fewer than 48 hours left until the new year begins, so it's 
final exam time, to see just how close you were paying attention to the news in 
1990. That's right, it's the fourth annual Times Orange County Trivia Quiz. 
Don't bone up on subject areas such as world peace, global warming or the size 
of the federal deficit. You'll be better prepared if you know such important 
facts as the cost of an official souvenir tie at the Richard M. Nixon Library 
&amp; Birthplace ($25), how many times bigger the new John Wayne Airport 
terminal is than the old (12), and what Bishop Desmond Tutu's least favorite 
ride was when he visited Disneyland (Splash Mountain). Answer 35 to 40 right 
and you can rent yourself out to the public library's local history room. Get 
25 to 34 right, and go to the head of the metered on-ramp. Get 15 to 24 
correct, and go to the back of the line of the metered on-ramp. Fewer than 15 
right? Move to Los Angeles County. But don't worry, this is an open-book test. 
So pull out the last 364 issues of the daily newspaper and let's get trivial.
