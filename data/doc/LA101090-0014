PROPOSITIONS FOR TERM LIMITS 
In arguing against term limitations, Polsby states that "term limitations throw 
away the benefits of learning from experience." 
Exactly! What poor Polsby doesn't seem to understand is that this is the very 
reason we want to limit terms of our elected representatives. And what are the 
major things our representatives learn from experience? How to get reelected by 
getting money from powerful special interests, how to build up their personal 
power bases at public expense, how to use their offices for personal gain, etc.
