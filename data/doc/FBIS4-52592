Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Vietnam today, reacting to 
foreign reports dated May 10 on the Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs' statement relating to the Thanhlong Sea area, 
reiterates the following: 
  `As determined by international law, especially the 1982 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, the areas of Tuchinh and 
Thanhlong lie within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and 
continental shelf, entirely under Vietnam's sovereignty. 
Vietnam has the sovereign right to explore and exploit natural 
resources in these areas by itself or in cooperation with other 
foreign countries, a right with which no other country has the 
right to interfere. These areas are in no way related to the 
Truongsa archipelago or the adjacent waters. Any statement or 
act contrary to this principle is illegal and runs counter to 
international law'.
