VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
D. A. TO KEEP STAFF OFF CRIMINAL JURIES 
Ventura County prosecutors no longer would be allowed to serve on criminal 
juries under a policy tentatively approved Tuesday by Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury. 
The policy was drafted less than two weeks after a prosecutor served as foreman 
on a Municipal Court jury that convicted an Oxnard man of being under the 
influence of heroin. 
Judge Steven Hintz, who allowed Deputy Dist. Atty. Terence M. Kilbride to sit 
on that jury, granted a new trial Friday to William Lopez, 28. Hintz made his 
ruling not because of Kilbride's jury service, but because he said the trial 
prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kent Baker, violated Lopez's constitutional 
rights by asking whether he had refused to waive his rights to an attorney when 
he was arrested. 
Bradbury said the new policy is "based on our conclusion that there is a 
conflict of interest in that case and in all future cases." 
Under the new policy, any prosecutor called to jury duty must tell the judge 
about the policy and ask to be excused. If the judge refuses, the trial 
prosecutor should ask the defense attorney to excuse the prosecutor-juror. And 
if the defense refuses, the trial prosecutor should move to excuse the 
prosecutor-juror from the panel, the policy says. 
The Ventura County public defender's office already has a policy forbidding 
deputy public defenders from serving on juries in cases that it represents, 
Assistant Public Defender Jean L. Farley said. 
About six months ago, Farley said Deputy Public Defender Susan Olson was 
excused from the trial of a man who was being represented by a colleague, 
Stewart Spivak, now a private attorney. MACK REED
