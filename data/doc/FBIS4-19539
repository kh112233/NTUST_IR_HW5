  [Text] Hendaye, France, April 19 (AFP) -- Fifteen Spanish 
fishing boats blockaded this southwestern port on Tuesday [19 
April] as tension remained high after a battle between 60 
Spanish and 12 French vessels. 
  The French gunboat Commandant l'Herminier patrolled 
off-shore 
after arriving in the middle of the night from its Britanny base 
in Lorient. 
  The fifteen anchovy fishing boats were aiming to prevent 
French trawlers from sailing on Tuesday. Other vessels were 
stationed out at sea to prevent sailings from nearby 
Saint-Jean-de-Luz and Bayonne, southwestern France. 
  A flotilla of 60 Spanish boats from Fuenterrabia, across the 
border from here, attacked the 12 French trawlers on Monday for 
exceeding their anchovy quota. The French quota is 2,700 tonnes 
a year and the Spanish 27,000 tonnes. 
  One French boat, the Laetitia, was seized and towed with its 
crew to Fuenterrabia where an angry crowd burned its nets and 
destroyed its navigation equipment. 
  The Spanish started fires on three of the French ships, 
hurling petrol bombs and trying to board them after throwing 
grappling irons. Spanish fishermen said nine of their boats 
were damaged. 
  In Paris Tuesday, French Fisheries Minister Jean Puech 
conceded that the French fishermen should respect their quotas, 
but said that Spanish fishermen had no right to enforce European 
Union rules in French waters.
