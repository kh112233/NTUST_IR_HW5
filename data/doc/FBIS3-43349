  [Text] The South African embassy in Maputo has delivered a 
note of protest to the Mozambican Department of Foreign Affairs 
regarding several attacks on South African tourists in 
Mozambique. The South African charge d'affaires in Mozambique, 
Mr. (John Sund), has also been in contact with the Mozambican 
minister of police. This followed incidents on the road past 
the Namaacha Border post between Swaziland and Mozambique where 
motorists have been allegedly harassed by members of the 
Mozambican police force and forced to pay bribes. A South 
African couple were forced off the road by an armed gang, 
assaulted, and had they car stolen near the Ressano Garcia 
Border post.
