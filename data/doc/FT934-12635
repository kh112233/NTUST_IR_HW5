FT  26 OCT 93 / Protection for part-time workers
THE House of Lords yesterday began a judicial review of an allegation by the
Equal Opportunities Commission that employment protection legislation
discriminates against part-time workers, Lisa Wood writes.
The commission alleges that the government discriminates against women by
making part-timers work three years longer than full-time workers before
qualifying for employment protection rights.
In early 1990 the commission wrote to the government claiming that certain
provisions of the Employment Protection Act 1978 were in breach of European
Community sex equality law. It asked for legislation to remove the
restrictions on employment rights for part-timers.
The government said it had no plans to amend the legislation, and the
commission applied to the High Court for a judicial review.
The High Court ruled that the statutory provision was not contrary to EC
law. The commission appealed to the Court of Appeal which ruled by a
two-to-one majority that the government was not discriminating against
part-time workers. It also ruled that this sort of case should be pursued by
individuals through the tribunal system rather than by the commission using
judicial review proceedings.
The Court of Appeal rejected the commission's request for the right of
appeal to the House of Lords. But the commission successfully petitioned the
Lords for a judicial review.
