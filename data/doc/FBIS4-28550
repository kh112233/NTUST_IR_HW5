  [Text] Joint patrols between Indonesia and Singapore have 
led to a reduction of sea robberies in the Philip Channel and 
the Singapore Strait. From an average of 10 a month in 1992, it 
went down to nearly zero last year although there were a number 
of incidents close to or just outside the patrol area. This was 
revealed by the first Indosin Joint Coordinating Committee 
meeting held at Mindef [Ministry of Defense] today. 
  It was led by the assistant for operations to the chief of 
general staff of the Indonesian Armed Forces, Major General 
(Sofyan Affandi), and the SAF [Singapore Armed Forces] director 
of Joint Operations and Planning Directorate, Colonel Goh Yong 
Siang. The committee, which meets twice a year, discussed ways 
to make the patrols more effective through an exchange of 
information and pursuit of sea robbers across international 
boundaries.
