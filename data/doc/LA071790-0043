JAILED BRITISH NURSE FREED AFTER APPEAL 
The government freed British nurse Daphne Parish, who had been sentenced to 15 
years in jail for helping a British-based Iranian journalist hanged as a spy. 
Parish, 53, was released after an appeal by Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda 
and flown to Lusaka, Zambia's capital. In March, she was sentenced by a 
revolutionary court for driving journalist Farzad Bazoft to the site of a 
secret military installation to check reports of an explosion. Bazoft, 31, was 
executed after allegedly confessing to spying for Israel and Britain.
