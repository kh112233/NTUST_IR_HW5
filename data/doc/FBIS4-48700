  [Text] Abidjan, 24 May (AFP) -- The Abidjan district court 
today sentenced David Deliwa Gogbe, editing manager of the 
weekly LE CHANGEMENT, a paper with ties to opposition parties, 
to one year in jail for slandering a top dignitary of the regime. 
  In the article, LE CHANGEMENT implicated Germain 
Coffi-Gadeau, the grand chancellor of the national order and a 
close associate of the late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, in 
a criminal case. 
  Mr. Gogbe, who appeared before the court freely, was jailed. 
He is the seventh Ivorian journalist to be jailed since 
February. Four journalists have been found guilty of slandering 
the head of state, and two have been found guilty of disrupting 
public order.
