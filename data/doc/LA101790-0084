TRIAL OF NAVY PETTY OFFICER ACCUSED OF MURDER BEGINS 
Jurors heard opening arguments Tuesday in the murder trial of Robert William 
Nydegger, a Navy petty officer charged with killing his roommate and stuffing 
the body into a refrigerator in the back yard of their Imperial Beach house. 
Nydegger, 43, is charged with murdering 39-year-old Timothy Cudd with a lethal 
dose of the antihistamine known in its over-the-counter form as Benadryl. 
Nydegger is also charged with four counts of forgery stemming from the alleged 
use of four of Cudd's checks. He is accused of passing or attempting to pass 
checks worth $3,431. 
In his opening statement to the jury, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Amador outlined 
the circumstantial evidence -- including Nydegger's apparent attempted suicide 
with Benadryl and the discovery of Cudd's checkbook in Nydegger's desk -- which 
he said point to Nydegger's guilt. 
Defense attorney Charles Bumer insisted during his opening statement that 
Cudd's death was a suicide. 
Cudd was afflicted with Huntington's chorea, a debilitating nerve disorder that 
had begun to affect his movement. Bumer also said that Cudd was suffering from 
the same psychiatric disorder affecting Nydegger -- post-trauma stress 
syndrome, a condition Bumer said resulted from their service in Vietnam. 
Bumer admitted that Nydegger "may have behaved strangely" or in an "irrational" 
manner by attempting to hide the body, but contended that was because of his 
own mental illness. 
The trial is expected to last about four weeks.
