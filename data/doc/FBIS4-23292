  [Text] Pretoria June 1 SAPA -- South Africa will provide 
humanitarian assistance to Rwanda, which is engulfed by 
internecine strife, following an urgent appeal from the United 
Nations. In a statement on Wednesday [1 June] night, a 
spokesman for the president's office, Mr Joel Netshitenzhe, said 
the decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. He 
said further details would be released after consultations with 
the UN about the role South Africa could play to help 
international efforts to end the conflict in Rwanda. 
  Another decision was taken to dedicate June 16, the 
anniversary of the Soweto pupil uprising, to the promotion of 
the culture of learning and teaching. President Nelson Mandela 
would attend an event in Soweto to launch the campaign. 
  The statement said Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, together 
with US Vice President Al Gore, would open a major conference in 
Atlanta, Georgia at the weekend aimed at exploring ways in which 
American investors and other institutions could assist South 
Africa's Reconstruction and Development Programme. US Secretary 
of Commerce Ron Brown and various American corporate, foundation 
and other government leaders would participate in the conference. 
  Details on other decisions of cabinet would be announced by 
the relevant ministries in due course, the statement said.
