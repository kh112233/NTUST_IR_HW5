FT  16 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: French fish and potato protests
stepped up
FRENCH FISHERMEN and potato farmers yesterday stepped up pressure on
France's beleaguered socialist government, now only ten days away from
parliamentary elections, with fresh outbreaks of unrest throughout the
country.
A 'commando raid' of Etaples fishermen caused between FFr4m and FFr5m
(Pounds 490,000-Pounds 600,000) of damage in a dawn raid on a fish warehouse
at Boulogne-sur-Mer. They set fire to cargoes of imported fish outside the
warehouse, then ransacked trailers of fish from Denmark and Ireland.
The mood of France's fishing ports has become increasingly heated in recent
weeks as fishermen have escalated their protests against imports of cheap
fish. Fishermen's leaders have vowed to continue the dispute until
Thursday's meeting of European Community fishing ministers in Brussels.
However, one group of Breton fishermen today plans to stage a 'humanitarian
and pacifist' protest by delivering six tonnes of fish to a food bank
outside Paris to be distributed to the needy through the Salvation Army and
other voluntary organisations.
Meanwhile potato farmers continued their battle against EC agricultural
reform by staging a tractor demonstration at Quimper yesterday morning
during which they blocked the streets with 400 tonnes of potatoes. This
followed similar protests in other towns last week.
The government also faces problems at the docks. Some of the largest French
trading ports yesterday came to a standstill as dock workers responded to
calls for a 24-hour national strike in protest at modernisation plans.
