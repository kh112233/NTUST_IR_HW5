ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ROSSMOOR; 
PASSENGER KILLED IN MOTORCYCLE CRASH 
A 17-year-old Rossmoor boy died early Friday shortly after the motorcycle he 
was a passenger on went out of control and crashed, the California Highway 
Patrol reported. 
James Englehaupt died at 1:10 a.m. at Long Beach Memorial Hospital, about two 
hours after the accident along St. Albans Drive in Rossmoor, said CHP spokesman 
Lyle Whitten. 
Englehaupt was a passenger on the off-road motorcycle driven by Michael David 
Winter, 18, also of Rossmoor. Whitten said the pair were headed east on St. 
Albans Drive near Silver Fox Road at an unknown speed when Winter apparently 
lost control of the motorcycle. 
They crashed into a curb and struck a post, throwing them from the motorcycle. 
Englehaupt suffered massive head and internal injuries while Winter, who was 
taken to the same hospital, had a broken arm and other minor injuries. Whitten 
said neither youth was wearing a helmet.
