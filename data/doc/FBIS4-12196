  [Text] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat arrived in Amman 
today on a visit to Jordan. 
  He was received at the airport by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali, the prime minister; Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, the 
information minister and minister of state for cabinet affairs; 
Faysal al-Husayni, the head of the Palestinian negotiating 
delegation; Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and Yasir 'Amr, PLO Executive 
Committee members; al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Palestinian 
ambassador in Amman; and Muhammad Qudsiyah, the commander of the 
Palestine Liberation Army in Jordan. 
  In a statement to journalists upon arrival at Amman Airport, 
'Arafat said: I am visiting Jordan to have the honor of meeting 
with His Majesty King Husayn to exchange views with him at this 
important time. His Majesty King Husayn has always been close 
to the Palestinian people and their national cause, may God 
watch over him. 
  Answering a question on the deportees' return, the 
Palestinian president said: This is another positive sign down 
the road. He expressed the hope that more deportees will 
return. In this regard, he said: I will leave actions to speak 
for themselves. He added: The talks are still taking place with 
Israel on various issues. I hope that progress will also be 
made at the economic talks which will be held in Paris tomorrow. 
  Concerning the security of Palestinians, 'Arafat said: The 
Cairo talks constitute a mechanism to implement UN Security 
Council Resolution No. 904. He expressed the belief that this 
is a fair beginning, especially since this is the first time 
that there has been international protection for the Palestinian 
people and the holy places. He called on the cosponsors of the 
peace talks to assume their responsibility and coordinate and 
cooperate with each other to implement this resolution.
