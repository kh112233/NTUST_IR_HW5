FT  16 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: World Bank facility enhances
liquidity
The World Bank is seeking to increase investor confidence in its structured
bonds by incorporating facilities in its forthcoming Dollars 5bn global
multi-currency note programme to improve the liquidity and price
transparency in the bonds in the secondary market.
The World Bank plans to raise at least Dollars 2bn of its annual borrowing
programme of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 12bn through structured
products. These products will be linked only to interest rates and exchange
rates.
Although structured bonds tend to have relatively short maturities, the
World Bank hopes that its liquidity facility will enable it to achieve
maturities of between four and 10 years. Mr Sudhir Krishnamurthi, senior
financial officer at the World Bank, said the liquidity arrangements were
designed to reduce concerns expressed by investors.
By offering to exchange its outstanding structured notes for new
floating-rate or structured notes, the World Bank hopes to be more
supportive of its sponsoring dealers' secondary market activities than other
issuers.
Mr Krishnamurthi said the World Bank's strong internal standards regarding
the use of derivatives should also appeal to investors. 'We tend to be
extremely careful to ensure that the structures make sense and have the
right risk relationships,' he said.
The multi-currency programme, which replaces the World Bank's existing
programmes, is likely to start next week and should enable the World Bank to
continue to drive down its funding costs.
The sponsoring dealers for the programme are Commerzbank, Goldman Sachs, IBJ
International, Kidder Peabody, Lehman Brothers, Mitsubishi Finance and
Morgan Stanley. However, the dealers will be reviewed on a regular basis.
