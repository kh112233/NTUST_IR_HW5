<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Interior Ladislav Pittner, by </F>
Marcela Kostalova; place and date not given: "Ladislav 
Pittner's Dissatisfaction, or Who Has the Archives of the Former 
StB?"] 
  [Text] Attention in the domestic policy sphere is 
currently centered, self-evidently, on the dismissal of Vladimir 
Meciar and the subsequent formation of a new Slovak government. 
Nevertheless, it would be good to realize that there are still 
a number of other problems that require a solution because, in 
the event of a failure to resolve them, they could negatively 
influence the future development of this state. We discussed 
one of these problems with [new Interior Minister] Ladislav 
Pittner (Christian Democratic Movement). 
  [Kostalova] During the discussion of the report on the 
fulfillment of Ministry of Interior duties in the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] Committee for Petitions, 
Legal Protection, and Security, you raised serious objections to 
the way in which the Ministry contractually dealt with the issue 
of the transfer of archives between the former CSFR and the 
Slovak Republic or, rather, between organizations assigned this 
task. 
  [Pittner] We have learned that the treaty sets a period of 
25 years for the archives' transfer. At the same time, no 
priorities are set in the treaty as to which archives and which 
files will be transferred at which time. For example, it is a 
great disenchantment for me that to this day we have not 
received the personnel files of former StB [State Security 
Corps, communist-era secret service] operatives who were Slovaks 
or who simply worked here on Slovak territory. The explanation 
we were given was that there are too many files and that they 
must be handed over gradually. However, when we receive them 
five, 10, or 25 years from now, they can really serve only 
historians and not the purposes for which we would need to have 
them at home today. 
  [Kostalova] [At the NRSR committee meeting] You also voiced 
dissatisfaction with the solution to problems regarding the 
network of agents. 
  [Pittner] Yes, it is known that, in May or June 1992, 
federal bodies collected all files at district offices of the 
former StB in Slovakia and transferred them to Prague. At the 
same time, the contents of those files had not been put on 
record anywhere. We do not even have the certainty that what 
has now been returned to us--I am not referring to the register 
of files but to the files themselves--is complete. This 
[uncertainty] even raises a number of doubts about what we 
actually have here. And, because we know from all available 
sources of information that the former StB had also provided 
data on its permanent staff and network of agents to foreign 
intelligence services, we do not even have a guarantee that we 
would be able to resist such a risk [of former StB agents being 
approached by foreign intelligence services]. To argue that 
these people would no longer be susceptible to blackmail if the 
screening law were abolished is naive. Even if the screening 
law were to be abolished in the future, they would still be 
assailable, albeit only on a social level. This is another 
shortcoming arising from the fact that the adopted skeleton 
treaty simply does not emphasize certain priorities. These 
should concern, above all, active [zivy] files that are of 
importance to the security of our Republic. 
  [Kostalova] Is there anything that could still be done in 
this matter? 
  [Pittner] At this moment, I can scarcely imagine any more 
effective course of action. I remember, for example, a 
statement by Mr. Mitro, director of the Slovak Information 
Service [SIS], that, when he asked the Czech Ministry of 
Interior, which is responsible for the archive of the former 
Federal Ministry of Interior, that materials regarding a certain 
specific matter be issued to him, he received a negative reply. 
The Czech Interior Ministry justifiedly argued that it is not 
authorized to negotiate with the intelligence services of other 
states. And our ministry, in turn, is bound by the aforesaid 
intergovernmental agreement. 
  [Kostalova] Does this mean that we are powerless? What 
about the NRSR Committee for Petitions, Legal Protection, and 
Security, for example? 
  [Pittner] The Committee is not directly charged with 
intervening in such matters, even though we will naturally 
support everything that might mend the situation. It is 
possible, however, that, after some time, the Czech side will 
come to understand our fears and that the anticipated 
cooperation within the framework of the Visegrad group, in 
particular, will make it change its view of cooperation between 
the appropriate bodies of the Czech Republic and the Slovak 
Republic in this area.
