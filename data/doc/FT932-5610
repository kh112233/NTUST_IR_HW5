FT  03 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Software piracy cost declining in Europe
SOFTWARE piracy in Europe, now costing the computer industry more than
Dollars 4.6bn annually in lost sales, is on the decline.
Statistics published yesterday by the Business Software Alliance, which
represents the major personal computer software houses, showed the
percentage of illegal software used in Europe fell from 76 per cent to 66
per cent between 1990 and 1991.
The reasons for the decline included tougher copyright laws throughout the
EC, local campaigns which have increased awareness of the penalties for
piracy, and a flood of legal actions against infringers.
Mr Brad Smith, European legal counsel for the BSA said: 'Last year, the BSA
filed more than 100 legal actions in 10 countries in Europe'.
Financial losses in 1992 were highest in France at Dollars 1.3bn, while the
greatest level of piracy was found in Italy and Spain at 85 per cent of the
market.
The UK showed most improvement, Mr Smith said, where legal software now
constitutes 46 per cent of the market.
