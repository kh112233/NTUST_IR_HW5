EX-U.S. ARMS CONTROL ADVISER NITZE HAILS LATEST SOVIET OFFER TO CUT TROOPS 
Paul H. Nitze, a key Reagan Administration arms control adviser, Wednesday 
hailed as "extraordinary" a Soviet proposal to cut conventional forces and 
urged President Bush to work "hammer and tongs" to nail down a pact. 
"I think he ought to negotiate very seriously on it; the Soviets are moving 
toward our initial (arms control) initiative," Nitze said in response to 
questions at a National Press Club luncheon. 
"I see no reason for not going at this hammer and tongs to try to work out this 
conventional reduction and stabilizing proposal," Nitze said. "I'm sure they 
will do that. I don't see how they could refuse to look at it." 
Nitze, who advised President Reagan on a range of arms control matters, said 
the proposal made by Soviet arms negotiators at a closed meeting with U.S. and 
allied officials in Vienna on Tuesday nearly matches the one offered earlier by 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
The Soviet Union proposed sweeping reductions in its military forces in Europe, 
including cutting 1.26 million troops and tens of thousands of tanks, artillery 
and armored vehicles.
