  [Text] Johannesburg Feb 17 SAPA -- The Pan-Africanist 
Congress' [PAC] youth wing on Thursday asked whether it had to 
kill a journalist to ensure that it got fair media coverage. 
  Azanian National Youth Unity [Azanyu] National Chairman 
Mosotho Petlane said Azanyu's "endurance cup is running out" 
because the media had largely ignored memorial services for 
Azanian Peoples Liberation Army Commander Sabelo Phama. "We 
would like the media to advise us on what we must do. Must we 
kill one journalist before we get fair coverage? Or must we 
demand a PAC volkstaat [homeland]? Or must we threaten a civil 
war?" Mr Petlane asked. 
  He alleged that the SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] was masterminding a campaign against the PAC. He 
said that of the 17 memorial services for the late commander, 
only one had been partly covered by the media. He said the 
deaths of Chris Hani and Andries Treurnicht had received 
extensive coverage. Freedom of the press was a two-way process, 
he said.
