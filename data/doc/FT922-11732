FT  24 APR 92 / Japanese guilty on Iran arms
A Japanese company and four former officials were found guilty yesterday of
illegally exporting missile parts to Iran, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Japan Aviation Electronics Industry was fined Y5m (Pounds 21,140), a company
spokesman said. The former officials, including ex-president Yukio Kaito,
received two-year prison sentences suspended for three years. The company
was accused both in Japan and the US of repairing US-licensed missile parts
for Iran during its 1980-88 war with Iraq.
