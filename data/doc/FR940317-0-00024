Ascorbic Acid, Erythorbic Acid, Citric Acid, Sodium Ascorbate, and Sodium Citrate on Beef, Lamb, and Pork Cuts



<AGENCY>
AGENCY: 

Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA.



</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Final rule.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the Federal meat inspection regulations to permit the application
of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate, singly or in combination,
to the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts to delay discoloration of such cuts. Use of these substances will
result in the preservation of a fresh color and appearance throughout the product's microbiological shelf life.
This action is in response to petitions submitted by Wilson Foods Corporation. In addition, FSIS is amending the regulations
to clarify the permitted use and levels of such substances on fresh pork cuts, and revise the purpose of these substances
from ``to maintain color'' to ``to delay discoloration'' for clarification. Preserving the fresh color and appearance
of beef and lamb cuts increases the marketability of such products; therefore, losses to manufacturers due to color
deterioration will be reduced. In addition, FSIS is removing and reserving 9 CFR 317.8(b)(37), which requires qualifying
statements on fresh pork cuts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Executive Order 12866



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.



Executive Order 12778



This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) from imposing any marking, labeling, packing, or ingredient
requirement on federally inspected meat products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under
FMIA. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdictions over meat products that are
outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat products that are misbranded
or adulterated under the FMIA, or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their
entry into the United States. Under the FMIA, States that maintain meat inspection programs must impose requirements
that are at least equal to those required under the FMIA. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements
on such State inspected products and establishments.

No retroactive effect will be given to this rule. There are no applicable administrative procedures that must be exhausted
prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.



Effect on Small Entities



The Administrator, FSIS, has made a determination that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The final rule allows the application of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid,
citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate, singly or in combination, to the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh
lamb cuts to delay discoloration. This final rule will impose no new requirements on small entities. Current regulations
already allow these substances to be applied to the surface of fresh pork cuts. Currently, approximately 20 percent
to 25 percent of meat packaging companies are producing red meat cuts. FSIS estimates that less than 3 percent of these
companies will be affected by this final rule. Also, the Agency estimates the cost of applying these substances to
the surface of fresh beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts is between $.03 and $.04 per pound. However, if production of fresh
beef cuts or fresh lamb cuts treated in this manner increases and a sustained market develops for these products, the
cost will decrease.

The meat industry will benefit from this final action because the preservation of the fresh color and appearance of
beef cuts and lamb cuts for a longer period of time should increase the marketability of these products, thereby reducing
the losses to manufacturers due to color deterioration of beef cuts and lamb cuts. Manufacturers, both large and small,
opting to use such substances will be required to revise the ingredients statement on product labels to show the presence
of ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and/or sodium citrate. However, the use of these
substances will be voluntary, and any costs associated with new label applications will be covered under existing
approved paperwork requirements of FSIS's prior label approval system.

Manufacturers choosing to apply ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, sodium ascorbate, and sodium citrate,
singly or in combination, to fresh beef cuts and fresh lamb cuts will be required to develop and maintain an approved
partial quality control (PQC) program, and would thus incur expenses associated with maintaining the PQC program.
Decisions by individual manufacturers on whether to use such substances on the surface of fresh beef and fresh lamb
cuts will be based on their conclusions that the benefits will outweigh the costs of maintaining the required PQC program.
Current regulations already require manufacturers of fresh pork cuts using those substances to develop and maintain
an approved PQC program.
