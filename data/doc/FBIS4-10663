  [Text] The British (Tour World) company will begin 
operations in Cuba in early May at Santa Lucia Beach on the 
northern coast of Camaguey. This is Great Britain's fifth 
largest tourism company in terms of the number of people it 
serves. The company will have 140 rooms in the four-star Cuatro 
Vientos and Caracol Hotels. The British tourists will join those 
who prefer the attractions of Santa Lucia beach, the bulk of 
whom come from Germany, Canada, The Netherlands, and Italy. 
  Felix Moreno, regional manager of the Cubanacan S.A. 
Corporation, stressed that there was an increase in the number 
of tourists who visited this region of Camaguey in April. This 
region contains a little over 25 percent of Cuba's beaches.
