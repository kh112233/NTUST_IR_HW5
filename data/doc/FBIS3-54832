  [Text] TALLINN, Jan 03, BNS -- Estonia's taxation law, 
which establishes excises, income tax, gambling tax, gift and 
inheritance tax, turnover tax, land tax, social tax and customs 
tax as state taxes, took effect as of the beginning of the year. 
Most of the taxes are regulated under new laws adopted last 
year. 
  Besides state taxes, local governments may impose local 
taxes 
that are in force only in their territories. The local taxes are 
to be defined by a separate law that hasn't been passed yet. 
  The turnover tax law, which was amended last year, didn't 
change the 18-percent tax rate but trimmed the list of goods and 
services exempt from the tax. No turnover tax is imposed on the 
export of goods and services. The turnover tax was Estonia's 
biggest source of revenues at 2.26 billion kroons. 
  The income tax law, which was also amended last year, set 
the 
tax at 26 percent for both private persons and corporate bodies. 
The income tax is imposed also on income from interest, but the 
parliament ruled not to apply it this year. All wage earners are 
likely to benefit from the new rate. 
  The 40-percent gambling tax that replaced the former 
10-percent rate will be channeled into the state budget. It will 
be divided as follows: 30 percent to the National Culture 
Foundation, seven percent to the Red Cross, seven percent to the 
Children's Foundation, seven percent to the Child Protection 
Union, and 49 percent to the Chamber of the Disabled.
