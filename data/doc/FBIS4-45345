  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 18 May--The drug 
trafficker Roberto Villalba Luna, who had infiltrated the ranks 
of the local government's Directorate of Public Safety and 
Roadways, was arrested last night with three members of his 
gang. They were attempting to load a ton of marijuana into a 
vehicle for shipment to the United States. This announcement was 
made by the Federal Judicial Police [PJF] deputy commissioner in 
the state, Javier Norona Guerrero, who added that the commercial 
value of the drugs exceeded $4 million. 
  The source noted that the 35-year-old subject, in uniform, 
with three other drug dealers, was intercepted at 630 Bolivia 
Street in the Colonia El Barreal, after having removed the drugs 
from the vicinity of that residence, and attempting to put them 
into a van. 
  The capture culminated a long investigation begun three 
weeks 
ago, when the large-scale movement of drugs in the town began to 
arouse suspicion. 
  The action by the Attorney General's Office [PGR] was 
coordinated by the force's first commander. The nearby streets 
were surrounded and a counternarcotics security operation was 
mounted, in which the subject's accomplices, Jesus Dorantes, 
aged 21; Patricio Esparza, 34; and Gerardo Calderon, 36, were 
also captured, according to the official. 
  He added that the first investigations conducted by the PGR 
had indicated that the police agent, Roberto Villalba Luna, with 
four years of service in the department, was moving large 
volumes of various drugs to the United States, using his 
position as protection. 
  Norona reiterated: "His main function was to guard the drugs 
as far as the Mexican border, and he would be shielded by his 
uniform." 
  He explained that the operation, which began at 2000 today, 
will continue, according to a report from the PJF offices, with 
more arrests made as the investigations are pursued. 
  The official added that those arrested, as well as the 
drugs, 
were placed at the disposal of the Federal Public Prosecutor's 
Office.
