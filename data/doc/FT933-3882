FT  11 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Jordan could sign deal with Israel next
week
KING HUSSEIN, the Jordanian ruler, yesterday said he believed Jordan could
sign an outline peace agreement with Israel in Washington next week, soon
after the PLO and Israel sign their declaration of principles on Monday.
Speaking in Britain where he has been on a private visit, King Hussein said
negotiators in Washington would sign the 'agenda' to guide detailed
negotiations with its neighbour 'if not on Monday, then Tuesday at the
most'.
The king said agreeing a full peace treaty with Israel would take time, but
added: 'Certainly the process leading to resolving all the problems, as they
relate to Israel and Jordan - the beginning will be very, very soon.'
The Jordanian-Israeli track of the talks in Washington had been the least
problematic of the four simultaneously negotiated tracks between Israel and
the Palestinians, Lebanon and Syria.
Jordan's talks with Israel have centred on the return of two small strips of
land and water rights. Amman had essentially been waiting for the
Palestinians to reach agreement with Israel.
King Hussein, after initial anger at having been bypassed by the PLO in its
secret negotiations with Israel, has since publicly backed the accord. Last
night he said it was 'a very important landmark. . . I would certainly hope
that it will. . . lead to peace in our region.'
Neither Syria nor Lebanon have announced any progress in the latest talks in
Washington, which ended this week. Both remained impassive yesterday at
Israel's recognition of the PLO - Syria particularly is rankled by the PLO's
lack of consultation. Damascus restated its demand that the Jewish state
must withdraw from all occupied Arab land, while Lebanon rejected an Israeli
paper presented to its negotiators at the peace talks in Washington, saying
it ignored UN Resolution 425 which demands unconditional Israeli troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
