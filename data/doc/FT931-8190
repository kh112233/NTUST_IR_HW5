FT  20 FEB 93 / New cancer drugs show promise
THREE new approaches to cancer treatment are giving promising results in
early clinical tests, an oncology conference in London was told yesterday.
All three result from collaborative research involving Scotia
Pharmaceuticals, a UK-Canadian drug company, and university medical centres
in the UK and overseas.
Potentially the most far-reaching treatment is a tumour-killing drug, EF13,
which Scotia described as a 'magic bullet' which could destroy cancer cells
without harming normal tissues.
Preliminary clinical trials indicate that the drug may double the survival
time of patients with late-stage pancreatic and breast cancers.
The doctors involved, however, are wary of making extravagant claims for
what is still an experimental drug. 'EF13 seems to have important
therapeutic effects without harming the patients,' said Mr Ken Fearon from
Edinburgh University's department of surgery. 'It really is different from
anything else available.'
Dr David Horrobin, Scotia chief executive, said EF13 was developed not to be
a more potent cell killer than other cancer drugs but to be free of the
toxic side effects which make conventional chemotherapy so unpleasant. It is
similar chemically to Evening Primrose Oil which has until recently been the
main source of income for his company.
The second new drug, EF27, reduces the harmful effects of radiotherapy.
Trials by the Radiobiology Research Group at Oxford's Churchill Hospital
show that the drug can protect normal tissue from radiation damage while
enhancing the damage caused to cancer cells.
The third drug, EF9, is a light-activated chemical designed to improve a
form of cancer treatment known as photodynamic therapy. EF9 destroys cancer
cells when the tumour is illuminated by laser.
If the treatments continue to show promise they could be available
commercially within three or four years.
