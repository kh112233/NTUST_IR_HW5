  [Text] The Islamic Party of Egypt has assumed 
responsibility for the attack on the passenger train carrying 
foreign tourists that took place in the vicinity of Asyut. As a 
result of this attack, two foreign tourists and two Egyptians 
were injured. According to AFP, the Islamic Party of Egypt 
issued a statement clarifying that this attack was to avenge the 
death sentence that has been imposed on three Muslims accused of 
an attempt on the life of Husni Mubarak. 
  This is the first time that the Islamic Party has mentioned 
the attempts by the Muslims against the life of the Egyptian 
president. The party also vehemently criticized the silence of 
the domestic media regarding two attempts on the life of Husni 
Mubarak in past months.
