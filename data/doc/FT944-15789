FT  17 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): New flights to Beirut
A new British airline is due to start daily non-stop Airbus A320 flights
from London's Heathrow to Beirut on October 28, with return fares starting
at Pounds 349. In doing so, it is banking on continuing peace in formerly
war-torn Lebanon.
The airline, British Mediterranean Airways, is backed by a
British-Italian-Argentinian consortium.
'Three years of peace have seen stability return and Lebanon is once again
set to attract large volumes of trade and tourism', an airline spokesman
said.
