<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of partially exclusive world-wide licenses
to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Applications SN 07/821,415 and 08/187,785, both entitled ``Inhibition
of Cell Proliferation Using Antisense Oligonucleotides'' to Lynx Therapeutics, Inc. of Hayward, California and
to Genta Incorporated of San Diego, California jointly with CV Therapeutics, Inc. of Mountain View, California.
The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America. 


The prospective partially exclusive licenses will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions
of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. These prospective partially exclusive licenses may be granted unless within 60 days
from the date of this published notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant
of the licenses would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
The patent applications disclose a novel strategy that uses antisense oligonucleotides to prevent the renarrowing
of heart valves or peripheral vessels (i.e., restenosis) following coronary balloon angioplasty. The antisense
oligonucleotides employed inhibit the proliferation of the smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that cause restenosis by
targeting specific mRNAs that encode certain cell cycle regulatory proteins. The oligonucleotides are delivered
locally via the slow biodegradation of polymers that have been saturated with the antiproliferative compounds.

ADDRESSES:

 Requests for copies of these patent applications, inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated
licenses should be directed to: Mr. Arthur J. Cohn, Esq., Technology Licensing Specialist, Office of Technology
Transfer, National Institutes of Health, 6011 Executive Boulevard, Suite 325, Rockville, Maryland 208923804.
Telephone: (301) 4967735 ext. 284; Facsimile: (301) 4020220. A signed Confidentiality Agreement
will be required to receive copies of the patent applications. Applications for a license in the any field of use filed
in response to this notice will be treated as objections to the grant of the contemplated licenses. Only written comments
and/or applications for a license which are received by NIH within sixty (60) days of this notice will be considered.
