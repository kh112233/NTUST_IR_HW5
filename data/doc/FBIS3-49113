  [Text] Bratislava Jan 5 (CTK) -- The disputed sections of 
the Czech-Slovak border are likely to be discussed by the two 
countries' interior ministers, Stanislav Becic, chairman of the 
Slovak delegation to the joint Czech-Slovak Border Commission 
tells today's issue of the left-orientated PRAVDA. 
  According to Becic, 63 percent or 270 kilometres, of the 
state border had been set by mid-December. Where the state 
border is formed by the Morava River, it runs along its middle, 
and the boundary stones are being placed on its banks. 
  On the issue of the 128 hectares Slovakia allegedly lost due 
to the regulation of the Morava River, Becic said that Slovakia 
had asked the Czech Republic to compensate for the territory at 
the Javornik settlement. "No settlement has been arrived at. 
No agreement has been reached regarding the Czech demands for 
the Kasarna weekend-house region and part of the Sidonia 
settlement either," Becic reports. 
  According to Becic, the Czech Republic considers the border 
sections Slovakia proposes to resolve to be disputable. By 
contrast, Slovakia believes there is no disputable section along 
the whole length of the border, since the state border should be 
in line with the current administrative border. 
  Becic says that if the documents from 1938 are compared, 15 
differences between the current administrative and the former 
borders have been found. 
  The commission has not arrived at an agreement in four cases 
(Sidonia, Kasarna and Vrbovce settlements, and the Morava River) 
and will not discuss them any more. "The proposals to resolve 
the situation will be dealt with by the ministers at their 
forthcoming meeting. If they, too, do not come to an agreement, 
the cases will be settled at the governmental level," Becic 
states.
