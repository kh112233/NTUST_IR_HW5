FT  03 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel to seek damages for cost of
extra safety
EUROTUNNEL, the Channel tunnel operator, intends to claim damages from the
British and French governments to compensate for the cost of additional
safety requirements.
The company has written to the British department of transport about changes
to the tunnel's operation and rolling-stock design imposed by the
Anglo-French tunnel safety authority.
Eurotunnel says that since the increased standards were not part of the
original concession contract, the additional costs should be paid for by the
governments.
'We are looking for compensation for the additional requirements,' said Mr
Douglas Hogg, commercial and communications manager at Eurotunnel. 'It's
impossible to say how much exactly, but it's likely to be in the order of
Pounds 100m.'
The company has also complained that it has to implement the new
requirements by 1994, while cross-channel ferries are not obliged to meet
international stability standards until 1999. It said Eurotunnel's
concession contract obliges the governments to allow it to compete on equal
terms with ferry companies.
Mr Hogg pointed out that the National Audit Office reported last week that
spot-checks on ferries between 1989 and 1991 uncovered defects that could
have 'a serious impact on the survivability of passengers in the event of an
accident.'
Eurotunnel's complaints follow a report last December by the House of
Commons home affairs select committee rejecting the group's allegations that
its commercial prospects were being hit by the safety authority's
bureaucracy.
Meanwhile Eurotunnel is in dispute with contractors building the link about
cost-overuns. Transmanche Link, a consortium of five British and five French
construction companies, is claiming additional payments of Pounds 800m at
1985 prices to cover changes to tunnel specifications.
