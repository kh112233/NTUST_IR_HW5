  [Text] The Federation of Electric Power Companies 
(president: Kohei Abe, president of Chubu Electric Power), 
organized by nine power companies, held a meeting of presidents 
from its nine member power companies on 19 January to decide on 
and announce plans for development of the No. 1 demonstration 
reactor of the fast breeder reactor (FBR), which has drawn 
attention as a key nuclear-fuel-recycling facility for the reuse 
of spent nuclear fuel. The No. 1 demonstration reactor is 
capable of generating about 660,000 kw and the cost of building 
the reactor is estimated at approximately 400 billion yen, 1.5 
times the cost of building a light water rector with the same 
capability. The building of the No. 1 demonstration reactor 
will start somewhere between 2000 and 2005. The reactor will go 
into actual operation in 2030, after construction of the No. 2 
demonstration reactor starts. 
  As for the choice of a site for the reactor, President Abe 
said: "At the present stage, our federation is studying it and 
our federation will make a close study of potential cites." In 
a bid to miniaturize the reactor and cut building costs, the 
federation will adopt a "modified top entry loop-type reactor" 
with short piping and simple structure for the first time in the 
world. At first, Japanese electric power companies studied the 
possibility of building a reactor that could burn only plutonium 
to draw down Japan's plutonium stockpile out of consideration 
for the international opinion against nuclear proliferation. 
In the end, however, the federation has decided to adopt a 
demonstration reactor model that uses "blanket fuel" to breed 
plutonium. In response, the government Atomic Energy Commission 
plans to revise the current long-term plans for development and 
utilization of atomic power.
