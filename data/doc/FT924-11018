FT  28 OCT 92 / Amnesty condemns Burmese torture camps
RECENT steps by Burma's military government to release some prisoners,
abolish military tribunals and lift a night-time curfew do not signify
fundamental change in its disregard for human rights, according to a report
by Amnesty International published today.
The human rights organisation says the State Law and Order Restoration
Council (Slorc) has systematically and ruthlessly suppressed dissent since
it assumed power in 1988.
It has held thousands of people either without trial or with unsatisfactory
trials. In addition to widespread arbitrary executions, security forces have
engaged in torture and rape. Amnesty says it knows of 20 'torture centres'.
Tens of thousands have been forced to work as porters for the military, and
many have suffered inhuman treatment. Thousands, particularly from ethnic
minorities, have been driven from their homes and forced into camps.
The Slorc ignored the results of a general election in May 1990 which the
opposition National League for Democracy, won by a landslide. Its leader,
Aung San Suu Kyi, has been under house arrest since July 1989. She was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year.
Amnesty says government policy and military strategy have created a climate
in which gross human rights violations are tolerated - perhaps even
sanctioned.
The organisation calls on Burma to end the death sentence, release political
prisoners or try them fairly, review convictions, investigate allegations of
torture and punish its perpetrators, ratify international human rights
protocols, and introduce human rights protection into its new constitution.
Amnesty urged the Burmese authorities to grant full access to the special
rapporteur appointed by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, who
is due to report to the UN general assembly later this year.
Myanmar: 'No law at all': Human rights violations under military rule.
