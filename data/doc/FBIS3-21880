  [Text] An International drug-trafficking ring which used 
the Evros River to smuggle large quantities of heroin and 
hashish from Turkey to Athens has been broken up after several 
months of surveillance by the police. 
  The gang, made up of two Iranians, one Turk and a Greek, had 
smuggled at least ten kilos of heroin to the country during the 
last five months. A tip-off led to a raid on a flat in 
Kalithea, southern Athens, and the members' arrest. The drug 
squad is still after other three alleged members of the gang. 
  The police confiscated 1.7 kilos of heroin, 704 grams of 
hashish and 11 grams of opium. 
  The 27-year-old Turk, who in 1991 had been arrested for 
drug-related offences, is thought to be the ring-leader. 
  In 1993, he was released from a Greek prison and deported. 
Using a false ID and documents, he returned to Greece and 
formed the gang. The arrested Greek is Dhimitrios Kolovos, aged 
37.
