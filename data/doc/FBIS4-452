  [Text] At least 2,000 Angolan civilians and troops have 
been killed in UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola]-held Soyo since a government offensive began there 
three weeks ago. Witnesses from neighboring Cabinda, where many 
Soyo residents have fled, said the Angolan Air Force began 
bombing UNITA positions in the north western oil base last year. 
The Angolan authorities reported that heavy fighting was 
continuing for control of the southern Huila region and Moxico 
in eastern Angola, but they remained tightlipped about the 
military situation in Soyo. 
  Angola was plunged back into a long-running post 
independence 
civil war after UNITA lost a United Nations supervised general 
election in September 1992.
