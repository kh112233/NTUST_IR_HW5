BRIEFLY 
Smoking Verdict Upheld: A Mississippi judge affirmed the controversial verdict 
in Horton vs. 
American Tobacco, a key smoker death case. Jurors last month found American 
liable for the lung cancer death of Nathan Horton, but awarded zero damages to 
his family. Tobacco lawyers asked Mississippi Circuit Judge Eugene Bogen to 
rule that American wasn't liable; plaintiff attorneys asked him to award 
damages or set a new trial on damages alone. Bogen refused to alter the result.
