Secretary of State Warren Christopher at his place of residence 
in London the day after tomorrow, Monday. 
  A responsible Jordanian source has said that the talks 
during 
the meeting will focus on developments in the peace process in 
the Middle East. 
  The source said that His Majesty King Husayn will emphasize 
Jordan's decision to suspend its participation in the peace 
talks if the sea blockade imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah 
continues. 
  The source noted that preliminary information indicates that 
the U.S. Administration intends to take certain measures to 
resolve the problem of the blockade imposed on the Port of 
al-'Aqabah. 
  It is worth mentioning that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will this week begin a tour of a number of Middle 
East countries with the objective of reactivating the peace 
process in the region. The tour will include Syria, Egypt, and 
Israel.
