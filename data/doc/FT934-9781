FT  09 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Swiss to get Celltech stake
CELLTECH, the bio-technology company that issued a pathfinder prospectus
yesterday, plans to reserve a fifth of the shares for sale in Switzerland.
The Slough-based company, which is a leader in genetic engineering of
antibodies, has contracts to manufacture a series of monoclonal antibodies
for Roche, the Swiss drugs group.
The flotation will raise between Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m for the company's
existing drug development programme, and will value Celltech at about Pounds
180m. The shares will be priced on November 25 and the offer closes on
December 2.
The administrators of British &amp; Commonwealth, who currently hold over 36 per
cent of the shares, will end up with a less than 10 per cent stake after
selling in the flotation.
