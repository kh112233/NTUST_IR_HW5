The Federal Aviation Administration said it has tightened security standards 
since the December bombing over Scotland of Pan Am Flight 103 that killed 270 
people, but a General Accounting Office investigation said the FAA does not 
know if airlines are meeting the standards. The GAO report was summarized by 
Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Ill.) at a hearing of her House Government Operations 
subcommittee on government activities and transportation. Collins said security 
deficiencies found in recent FAA airline inspections showed breakdowns in the 
training of airline security personnel. Isaac Yeffet, former director general 
of security for El Al Israel Airlines, told the subcommittee that training 
given security agents for U.S. air carriers "is extremely low, insufficient and 
not effective."
