  [Text] Pretoria May 10 SAPA -- Two grand old men of Africa, 
the founding presidents of Zambia and Tanzania, embraced outside 
the Presidensie in Pretoria on Tuesday morning. 
  Mr Kenneth Kaunda, in cravat and dapper safari suit, and Mr 
Julius Nyerere, carrying a wood and ivory swagger stick, are 
among 180 VIP guests at the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as 
South Africa's first black president. 
  Mr Kaunda and Mr Nyerere led their respective countries to 
independence and one-party rule more than 20 years ago. Zambia 
was ruled by Mr Kaunda until his election defeat by Frederick 
Chiluba, who is also in South Africa for the inauguration. 
  Mr Kaunda received a big hug and kisses on both cheeks from 
Palistinian Liberation Organisation Chairman Yassir 'Arafat, who 
arrived with his blonde wife to cheers and whistles. Mr 'Arafat 
smiled broadly and waved at the crowd, clearly pleased with his 
reception. 
  Anti apartheid movement founder Bishop Trevor Huddelston 
posed with Mr Nyerere and Mrs Adelaide and Dali Tambo, the wife 
and son of the late African National Congress Former President 
Oliver Tambo. 
  The inauguration is also attended by Kenyan forum for the 
restoration of democracy Chairman Prof Washington Okumu -- the 
man credited with setting South Africa's transition back on 
track by bringing Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi into the elections.
