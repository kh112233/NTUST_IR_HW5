VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS; 
EMPLOYEE ATTACKED OUTSIDE HOSPITAL 
A Los Robles Regional Medical Center employee was assaulted in the emergency 
room parking lot Friday morning on her way to work at the Thousand Oaks 
hospital, police said. 
The victim, whose name is not being released, suffered two broken ribs and a 
concussion after a man attacked her with a crowbar, said Lt. Kelly McIlvain of 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
The woman, a nursing technician at Los Robles, was treated and released, 
McIlvain said. She was assaulted immediately after she stepped out of her car 
just before noon, McIlvain said. "We speculate that she was interrupting him as 
he was about to burglarize a vehicle." 
Several patrol units, a helicopter unit, a canine unit and detectives searched 
the surrounding areas for the man but were unable to find him. 
The attacker is described as a Latino male with black hair and brown eyes, 
about 19 years old, 5 feet 8 inches and 140 pounds. PEGGY Y. LEE
