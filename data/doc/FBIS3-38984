  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Federal Government has assured 
Algeria that it will not tolerate criminal acts by Islamic 
fundamentalists. As the Bonn Foreign Ministry reported on 
Tuesday [8 February], FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel promised 
this in Brussels on Monday during a meeting with his Algerian 
counterpart, Mohamed Saleh, which focused on the ban on 
political activities by Rabah Kebir, which had been announced by 
Bonn. Kebir, who has applied for asylum in Germany, belongs to 
the leadership circles of the extreme, militant "Islamic 
Salvation Front" (FIS) in Algeria, which the government holds 
responsible for numerous murders of foreigners.
