FT  24 MAR 92 / Slovaks reject independence
The Slovak parliament yesterday rejected for the third time an attempt to
proclaim the region's sovereignty, which would be the first step towards
declaring independence and splitting Czechoslovakia, Reuter reports from
Prague.
The Slovak National Council in Bratislava threw out a motion by Mr Jozef
Prokes, leader of the separatist Slovak National Party, to discuss a law
which would have pronounced the sovereignty of the eastern of
Czechoslovakia's two republics, Czechoslovak radio reported.
Czech politicians say such a move would be unconstitutional. But several of
the major Slovak parties have already adopted a declaration of sovereignty
ahead of a general election due in June.
