SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 4(b)(3) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, requires that within 90 days of receipt of a petition
to list, delist, or reclassify a species, or to revise a critical habitat designation, a finding be made on whether
the petition has presented substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted, and that
such finding be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

 



If the finding is positive, Section 4(b)(3) also requires commencement of a review of the status of the involved species.
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) now announces a 90-day finding on a recently received petition.

The petition was submitted by Australians for Animals (in Australia) and the Fund for Animals (in the United States);
about 40 additional organizations in the United States and Australia were named as supporting the petition. It was
dated May 3, 1994, and was received by the Service on May 5, 1994. It requests that the koala 

(Phascolarctos cinereus),

 a bearlike Australian marsupial, be classified as endangered in New South Wales and Victoria, and as threatened in
Queensland.

The koala once occurred over much of the three indicated states, as well as in part of South Australia, and numbered
in the millions. The petition presents an extensive compilation of data, including recent direct testimony from
authorities on the species, suggesting that the koala has declined greatly in distribution and numbers, and that
its status is likely to continue to deteriorate. Reportedly, there are practically none left in South Australia and
only a few thousand in New South Wales and Victoria; the Queensland population may be less than 10 percent of what it
was in the 1920s.

The species was drastically reduced by excessive killing for its fur up through the 1920s. It subsequently was provided
legal protection from such killing, but, according to the petition, remnant populations are relatively small and
badly fragmented. Logging, agriculture, and other problems have eliminated at least two-thirds of the original
forest and woodland habitat, further declines are occurring, and little of the remaining habitat is well protected.
The species is totally dependent for food and shelter on certain types of trees within forests and woodlands. The destruction
or degradation of this habitat will reduce the viability of populations, even if the animals are otherwise protected,
and many local populations are said to have disappeared in recent years. Other reported problems include fires, diseases,
droughts, harassment by dogs, interference with normal gene flow, and killing along the roads now penetrating habitat.
The largest population remaining in Queensland is now said to be immediately threatened by a major highway project
that would bisect its habitat.

The Service is aware that the koala is generally protected by federal and procincial laws in Australia, and that there
have been intensive government efforts to conserve and reintroduce some populations. However, the information
presented by the petition gives cause for concern about the over-all prospects for the species and its natural ecosystems,
and suggests that further review of the situation is advisable. The Service therefore has found that the petition
presents substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. Also, pursuant to Section
4(b)(3), the Service hereby commences a review of the status of the involved species. Submission of appropriate data,
opinions, and publications regarding this petition is encouraged. In accordance with Section 4(b)(3), within 12
months of receipt of the petition, the Service will make another finding as to whether the requested action is warranted,
not warranted, or warranted but precluded by other listing measures.
