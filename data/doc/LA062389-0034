TEST TUBE PROVES FRUITFUL FOR COUPLE 
When David and Luz Barragan turned to in vitro fertilization five years into a 
childless marriage, they had no idea it would come to this. 
On Wednesday, the Guadalajara, Mexico, couple became the proud parents of a set 
of healthy quadruplets. Luz Adriana, Citali, Diego and David were born at 9:30 
p.m. at UC San Diego Medical Center, according to a hospital spokeswoman. The 
newborns' weights ranged from 3 pounds to 3 pounds, 10.5 ounces. 
"I am very happy and relieved because there was a lot of risk," David Barragan 
said Thursday. "Now the worries are about fatherhood." 
But these days, the risks associated with such a pregnancy are minimal, said 
Dr. Thomas Moore, director of the center's perinatal division. 
The odds of bearing quadruplets, normally 1 in 10,000, increase with the use of 
in vitro, or test tube, fertilization, Moore said.
