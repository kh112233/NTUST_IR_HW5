  [Excerpt] Yesterday in Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and a 
European Jewish Congress delegation led by Congress Chairman 
Jean Kahn discussed measures to combat xenophobia and racism. 
The delegation expressed its great concern over the growing 
excesses in Germany. Kohl said the federation and laender were 
doing everything in their power to combat such activities. 
  The chancellor added that on a European Union level, the 
German Government would call for the adoption of "common 
measures against extremism and xenophobia." Kohl and the 
delegation agreed that in this respect, particular attention 
should be paid to "the system of upbringing in all European 
countries." Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Jewish 
Council in Germany, and Israel Singer, general secretary of the 
World Jewish Congress, also took part in the meeting.
