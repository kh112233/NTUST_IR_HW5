  [Excerpt] Kigali, 15 Jun (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels and the 
Army fought with heavy artillery and small arms in the bloodied 
capital Kigali overnight and early Wednesday [15 June], despite 
the announcement of a two-month ceasefire. The ceasefire was 
announced Tuesday by a rebel official, Pasteur Bizimungu, who 
told the Organization of African Unity in Tunis that the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF) would order its fighters to hold their 
fire as of Tuesday evening. He told reporters that Rwanda's 
interim government had also pledged to observe a ceasefire. He 
said the truce was reached in a meeting with mediator Mobutu 
Sese Seko, the autocratic ruler of Zaire, and the presidents of 
Tanzania, Uganda and Burundi. 
  Meanwhile, UN-sponsored talks in Kigali which have been 
under 
way for two weeks have not yet led to a military settlement, 
while the rebels have been gaining ground. The head of the RPF 
delegation at the negotiations said Tuesday that the kidnap and 
presumed assassination by Hutu militiamen of 30 to 40 people, 
many of them children who had been sheltering in a church in 
Kigali, could scuttle these talks. [passage omitted]
