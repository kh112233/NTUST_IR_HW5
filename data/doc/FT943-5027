FT  06 SEP 94 / Compulsory tests for 11-year-olds
All 11-year-olds in England and Wales must take national curriculum tests
next year, education secretary Gillian Shephard announced yesterday.
But she also made a series of concessions designed to ensure that the tests
are not disrupted by a teachers' union boycott for the third year running.
National curriculum tests will now be compulsory for all children at the
ages of seven, 11 and 14.
