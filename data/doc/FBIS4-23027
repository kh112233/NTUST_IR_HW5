  [Abstract] The ability of the bacterial catalase to break 
up hydrogen peroxide forming during the ``respiratory 
explosion'' thus facilitating the microbe survival in the 
sensitive macro-organism and the fact that the plague microbe 
has a high catalase activity as well as reports that 
antibacterial preparations affect not only known microbial cell 
targets but also the factors which are important for revealing 
the pathogenic properties of the stimulants prompted a study of 
the effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations of various groups of 
antibiotics on the catalase activity of the plague microbe. To 
this end, two strains of plague microbe--one vaccinal 
(Yersinia pestis EV1290) and one virulent 
(Yersinia pestis 1300)--are used in an experiment in 
which the strain sensitivity to antibacterial preparations is 
measured by a series of dilutions in LB agar. Systematic data 
processing is carried out by Boyarskiy's method at a confidence 
interval I[.sub]95[/] for p=0.05. The plague 
microbe cell sensitivity to such antibacterial preparations as 
ampicillin, cefaxime, gentamycin, streptomycin, rifampicin, 
doxycyclin, and polymyxin B, the effect of their subinhibitory 
concentrations at various temperatures on the catalase activity, 
and the effect of their subinhibitory concentrations on the 
virulence of Yersinia pestis 1300 are summarized. The 
study reveals that introduction of sub-inhibitory concentrations 
of ampicillin, cefotaxime, or gentamycin to the cultivation 
medium leads to a significant decrease in the catalase activity 
of the plague microbe and that virulent Yersinia 
pestis 1300 strain cells grown at a 37C temperature in 
the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ampicillin or 
cefotaxime have a lower ability to cause the death of laboratory 
animals. Tables 3; references 9: 4 Russian, 5 Western.
