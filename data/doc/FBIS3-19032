  [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Moscow and Bonn are to make 
further joint efforts to solve the problems of Russian ethnic 
Germans. This was stressed by Horst Waffenschmidt, the German 
Government's representative for resettlers and parliamentary 
state secretary in the Interior Ministry, in Bonn on Friday [11 
March] at the conclusion of the fifth session of the 
German-Russian Government commission on Russian ethnic Germans. 
  He welcomed the fact that, in spite of the difficult 
situation it found itself in, the Russian Government had 
promised considerable funds. The German Interior Ministry would 
make available a total of 65 million marks this year for the 
settlement centers for Russian Germans. The money is to go to 
housebuilding, cultural institutions, and medium-sized 
enterprises.
