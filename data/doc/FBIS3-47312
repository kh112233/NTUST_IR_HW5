  [Text] Vientiane, January 11 (KPL) -- The construction of a 
hydro-power dam on Ho River in the Province of Champassak is in 
progress, said the head of the project, Mr. Bounkeut 
Khamphaphongphan. 
  The main work done in the past two months includes building 
a 
26-km road from Lasasin area to the construction site of the 
dam. The road is the first to link the area and the province of 
Attopeu. 
  The dam construction is a project the Government of Laos has 
signed a contract with a construction company of South Korea in 
the form of BOT 'build-operate-transfer'. This means that the 
investor puts money into building the facility then recovers its 
cost within 30 years. The Lao party holds a share of 20 per 
cent. After the period, the facility will be transferred to the 
Lao Government. 
  According to the official, now equipment worth U.S. dollars 
five million has reached the site, and field survey has started 
using a seismic equipment to define the construction site. 
  Another work to be done soon is determining water and forest 
areas for catchment, areas for conservation of bio-diversity, 
areas for tourism and areas where evacuation of people will be 
made. 
  This building project was scheduled for four years. The 
water current will be blocked in May 1996 and trial operation 
will be in the middle of October 1996. The hydro-power dam has 
a 150 megawatt capacity. The height of the dam is 80 metres 
while the width of its foot is 300 metres. The dam crest will 
be used as a road for vehicles to go to Attopeu District and 
Vietnam.
