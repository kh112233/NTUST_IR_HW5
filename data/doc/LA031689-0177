AGENCY TO LAUNCH STUDY OF FORD BRONCO II AFTER HIGH RATE OF ROLL-OVER ACCIDENTS 
The federal government's highway safety watchdog said Wednesday that the Ford 
Bronco II appears to be involved in more fatal roll-over accidents than other 
vehicles in its class and that it will seek to determine if the vehicle itself 
contributes to the accidents. 
The decision to do an engineering analysis of the Ford Motor Co. utility-sport 
vehicle grew out of a federal accident study of the Suzuki Samurai, said Tim 
Hurd, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA 
looked at Samurai accidents after Consumer Reports magazine charged that the 
vehicle had basic design flaws. 
Several Fatalities 
However, the accident study showed that the "Ford Bronco II appears to have a 
higher number of single-vehicle, first event roll-overs, particularly those 
involving fatalities," Hurd said. The engineering analysis of the Bronco, the 
second of three levels of investigation conducted by NHTSA, will cover the 
1984-1989 Bronco II models, the agency said. 
According to a Fatal Accident Reporting System study included in the September 
report on the Samurai, 43 Bronco II single-vehicle roll-overs caused 
fatalities, or 19 of every 100,000 vehicles. There were eight Samurai fatal 
roll-overs, or 6 per 100,000; 13 involving the Chevrolet S10 Blazers or GMC 
Jimmy, or 6 per 100,000, and six fatal Jeep Cherokee roll-overs, for 2.5 per 
100,000. After the accident report, NHTSA declined to investigate the Samurai. 
In Detroit, a Ford spokeswoman said the involvement of the Bronco II in fatal 
roll-over accidents "isn't significantly" different from that of other utility 
vehicles. "The Bronco II is well designed and is safe. I don't think this 
reflects the design or engineering of the vehicle," spokeswoman Joyce Stinson 
said. 
Stresses Safe Driving 
She said fatal roll-over accidents are "strongly influenced" by the driver's 
age and training and whether alcohol is involved. The type of terrain the 
vehicle is being driven on is another factor, Stinson said, as well as whether 
the driver is attempting some extraordinary maneuver with the vehicle. 
The utility vehicles have different handling capabilities, Stinson said, thus 
Ford stresses safe driving in its manuals for vehicle owners. 
Hurd said NHTSA investigators will analyze roll-over accidents involving the 
Bronco II to determine if environment, the types of drivers or the vehicle 
itself might have contributed to the accidents. 
In denying the petitions for an investigation of the Samurai, the agency said a 
high proportion of the roll-over victims were young, inexperienced drivers. 
Alcohol consumption was evident in 50% of the accidents, NHTSA said. 
Allegations against the Samurai spurred calls for NHTSA to adopt roll-over 
standards covering all vehicles. 
Rated 'Not Acceptable' 
The Samurai, a popular product of American Suzuki Motor Corp., came under 
attack last June. Consumer Reports magazine, published by Consumers Union, gave 
the Japanese vehicle its first "not acceptable" rating in a decade because of 
what the group said were basic design flaws. 
The magazine said the Samurai presented an unsafe combination of a high center 
of gravity, a narrow tread width and a light weight. It said tests revealed 
that the Samurai showed a dangerous tendency to roll over when performing 
relatively routine maneuvers at relatively low speeds. 
Consumers Union petitioned NHTSA for a full-scale investigation that could have 
led to a mandatory recall if the agency found the allegations valid.
