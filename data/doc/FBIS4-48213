  [Text] Bamako, 14 May (AFP) -- Six people were killed and 
several others wounded yesterday in Gao (northern Mali) 
following three attacks launched by Tuaregs, a reliable source 
reported today in Bamako. 
  The first incident broke out when three Tuaregs tried to 
seize a land cruiser near the central mosque. One of the 
bandits, caught by the crowd, was stoned and later burned while 
one of the remaining two was killed in an exchange of fire as he 
tried to run away. 
  A few hours later, several men belonging to the Tuareg 
community attacked the hospital, killing three civilians and 
wounding an undetermined number of people. Also, on the night of 
13 May, some Tuaregs threw grenade canisters into a house in 
Gao, killing one woman and injuring one child, the same source 
added. 
  These incidents come at a time when representatives of the 
Malian Government and the Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad 
(MFUA, former Tuareg rebels) have been meeting since 10 May in 
Algeria to work out measures that are likely to bring an end to 
the violence in northern Mali.
