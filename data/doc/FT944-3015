FT  15 DEC 94 / Technology: Whispers from the runway - A transport system
that will be propelled by magnetic attraction
For the past 10 years a 90-tonne machine has been tearing around an elevated
concrete track in north-west Germany, reaching speeds of up to 450kph but
making none of the noise made by aircraft travelling at that speed. It is
the Transrapid high-speed train, also known as the whispering arrow.
Now, after years of debate, the German government has approved plans to
build a 284km track between Berlin and Hamburg, Germany's two biggest
cities, in a move that is expected to take passengers away from those
airlines flying the route.
The Transrapid will be the world's first long-distance transport system
propelled by magnetic levitation, a technology that Thyssen, the German
conglomerate, has been developing. Instead of conventional engines, the
Transrapid is propelled by magnetic fields. It has no wheels and rather than
run on conventional railway tracks it clutches a concrete runway rather like
the runner on a curtain rail.
The technology dates from the 1920s when Hermann Kemper, an electronic
engineer who ran a meat packing business near the present 32km test site in
Emsland, began poring over papers about the theory of magnetic levitation.
Kemper developed a model in his cellar where objects were fired along
runways by passing mains electricity through electromagnets mounted on the
objects and on the runway.
In 1934 he registered his patents and tried unsuccessfully to persuade
Siemens, the electronics company, to take up his ideas.
What was missing, according to Hans Georg Raschbichler, an engineer from
Thyssen Henschel, the locomotive builder, was the means to produce and
transport large amounts of electricity at split-second intervals. 'They
didn't have the sort of high-tech electronics which exist today,' he says in
his office in Munich.
Now that large amounts of electricity can be passed around a grid and
engineers can regulate the 10mm gap between the runway and the vehicle, two
key bits of technology are available which mean that Kemper's model can
become a real ity.
The Transrapid operates on different principles from the maglev technology
used elsewhere in the world. Conventional magnetic levitation works by using
the repellant force of superconductive magnets of opposite polarities. In
the Transrapid, propulsion comes from the force of magnetic attraction.
By passing electrical current through a stator pack, the stationary part of
an electric motor which is laid out on the underside of a concrete runway, a
wandering magnetic field is created. This magnetic field - called wandering
because it moves down the runway - is attracted or excited by levitation
magnets mounted on the underside of the Transrapid, so propelling the
vehicle forward.
The Transrapid picks up speed proportional to the increase in electrical
current; the opposite happens when the frequency is reduced. If there is a
power failure, batteries on board the Transrapid are used to power the eddy
current braking system and to guide the vehicle to an emergency stop on the
runway.
The vehicle glides about 10mm above the concrete runway, a gap which is
measured by a computerised sensor: if it becomes smaller, the computer
orders more electricity, less if it becomes bigger. The process is repeated
thousands of times, keeping the gap constant and enabling the magnet to pull
the Transrapid.
Raschbichler heads a team of engineers at Thyssen Henschel which ran the
Transrapid 07, the seventh prototype, up to a maximum speed of 450kph last
year. They are now putting it through 500,000km of tests before it can be
licensed to operate.
Tests have shown that the vehicle uses less energy and is quieter than the
French TGV (Train a Grande Vitesse) or the German InterCity Express (ICE),
the two high-speed trains which are its main competitors. Stand 25m away
from a Transrapid passing at 300kph, and the maximum noise level recorded is
87 decibels - less than a freight train travelling at 100kmh. Tests by
independent engineers recorded about 100 decibels for a TGV travelling at
the same speed.
Because the Transrapid glides above a concrete runway it does not need to
overcome the resistance between track and wheels which traditional railway
technology still has to grapple with. That means, according to Thyssen
Henschel, that the Transrapid uses around 30 per cent less energy than a
high-speed train travelling at the same speed.
The government hopes that by 2004 a runway - similar to the present test
track - will be built and that more than 14m passengers a year will be
hurtling between Germany's two biggest cities. A journey that now takes more
than three hours by train will take just 55 minutes by Transrapid.
The DM5.6bn (Pounds 2.3bn) needed to finance the runway and infrastructure
will be put up by the federal government, and Thyssen has created a company
together with Lufthansa, the national airline, and Deutsche Bahn, the state
railway, which have to find DM4.8bn to operate the service.
The Japanese are working on similar technology but opted in the early 1970s
for an electrodynamic levitation system - where magnets repel rather than
attract each other. The different system also creates a 10cm gap, rather
than 10mm, between the vehicle and the runway which the Japanese say is
better suited to deal with earthquake risks.
The Transrapid technology creates magnetic fields of about 40 amps - no
bigger than those created by an electric razor - while the Japanese have to
grapple with big magnetic fields of up to 700,000 amps. About four times as
much electricity is needed to control the movement of the Japanese train
across such big magnetic fields and Thyssen says they are so powerful it is
thought people wearing pacemakers will not be able to use the trains.
