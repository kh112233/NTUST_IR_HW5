  [Text] In recent days, some mass media in the FRG have 
reported that the Vietnamese Government has supported certain 
organizations in bringing people from Vietnam to apply illegally 
for asylum in the FRG, and that the Vietnamese Embassy in the 
FRG legalized documents for these asylum seekers. The 
Vietnamese Embassy in the FRG totally denies all of this 
incorrect information. It confirms that the Vietnamese 
Government never tolerates such illegal actions. The Vietnamese 
Embassy in the FRG has resolutely refused to issue any documents 
to asylum seekers living illegally in the FRG.
