FT  01 JUN 94 / Observer: Waste disposal
Denmark did not much like the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development when it was headed by Jacques Attali.
Nothing much has changed now it's run by another Frenchman, Jacques de
Larosiere.
Svend Auken, the Danish environment minister, has peeved the EBRD over his
invitation to east European environmental ministers to attend a conference
in Copenhagen tomorrow. The subject: discussion of 'soft' loans to clean up
messes left by the former communist regimes.
The EBRD is still very sensitive over its role and likes to keep all matters
east European under its belt.
Thus, suggests Auken, the bank is trying to flush away his meeting. 'Given a
choice between building a Coca Cola plant . . . and a purification plant for
sewage waste, they (the EBRD) will always choose the former,' says an Auken
aide.
The Danes claim the EBRD is pointedly sending only junior staff to
Copenhagen, and that the bank has put word out that those east Europeans
sending ministerial-level deputations can whistle for cash in future.
Such is the strength of EBRD influence today, that all the ministers invited
have told Auken they will attend with pleasure.
Wouldn't have happened in Attali's day . . .
