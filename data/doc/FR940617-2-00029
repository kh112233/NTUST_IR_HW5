for the purposes for which the instruments shown below are intended to be used, are being manufactured in the United
States.

Comments must comply with Subsections 301.5(a)(3) and (4) of the regulations and be filed within 20 days with the Statutory
Import Programs Staff, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20230. Applications may be examined between

Docket Number: 

94064. 

Applicant: 

University of California, Berkeley, Physics Department, Berkeley, CA 94720. 

Instrument: 

Superconducting Solenoid. 

Manufacturer: 

Atomimpex, CIS. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used for the study of the properties of the pure electron plasmas which will be contained in a
trap inserted into the solenoid. The primary experiments will use the analogy between pure electron plasmas and 2-d
inviscid, incompressible fluids to study large number vortex dynamics. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

May 10, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94065. 

Applicant: 

Argonne National Laboratory, 9700 South Cass Avenue, Argonne, IL 60439. 

Instrument: 

Rapid Scanning Diode Array. 

Manufacturer: 

Hi-Tech Scientific Limited, United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

This is an accessory to an existing instrument which will be used in the investigation of the chemical properties of
new chelating agents for isolation, separation and recovery of heavy metals. In particular, the investigations
focus on lanthanides, actinides, d-transition elements, and other toxic heavy metals, and their complexes. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs:

Instrument: 

Mass Spectrometer. 

Manufacturer: 

Mass Analyzer Products, Ltd., United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used to perform geochronologic investigations (age determination of rocks and minerals by
methods including natural radioactive decay) using the 

40

Ar/

39

Ar method. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

May 12, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94068. 

Applicant: 

University of Illinois at Chicago, Psychology Department, 1007 West Harrison Street, Chicago, IL 60607-7137. 

Instrument: 

Monocular Oculometer for the Human Eye. 

Manufacturer: 

Devices for Movement Measurements, Germany. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used to analyze eye movements and provide valuable new data in an extended research project
entitled The Effect of Word Frequency During Two Readings of a Text and another study focussing on clarification of
the role of meaning and context in text comprehension. In addition the instrument will be used by students enrolled
in courses that provide research experience at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

May 18, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94069. 

Applicant: 

University of Hawaii, SOEST Engineering Support Facility, 2525 Correa Road, Rm 153, Honolulu, HI 96822. 

Instrument: 

Nitrogen Liquefier, Model MNP 10/1/300. 

Manufacturer: 

Stirling Cryogenics and Refrigeration, The Netherlands. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used to supply liquid nitrogen used to provide cryogenic cooling for a variety of scientific
instruments including mass spectrometer, nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer, mapping infrared spectrometer,
refrigerators for biological samples, X-ray fluorescence microscopes, high vacuum cold traps and other instruments
which are used in many different research programs. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs: 

May 19, 1994.



Docket Number: 

94071. 

Applicant: 

University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, 4301 W. Markham, Little Rock, AR 72205-7122. 

Instrument: 

Rapid Kinetics Accessory, Model SFA-20. 

Manufacturer: 

Hi Tech Ltd., United Kingdom. 

Intended Use: 

The instrument will be used to study the reduction of a series of nitroaromatic compounds using several bacterial
and mammalian nitroreductases. The kinetic constants K

m

 and K

cat

 will be determined. In addition, the instrument will be used in the course Biopharm 3223 Pharmaceutical Analysis
a study of the general chemical and biochemical procedures, techniques and instrumentation involved in quantitative
and qualitative analysis. 

Application Accepted by Commissioner of Customs:
