Two trains collided head-on Thursday at a station in central Japan, injuring 
118 people, most of them schoolchildren, Kyodo News Agency reported. 
The agency said a two-car train with 220 passengers rammed into the front of a 
stationary three-car train carrying 330 people at Minami Minowa, about 100 
miles west of Tokyo. It quoted police as saying the accident was caused either 
by a fault in automatic switching or driver error.
