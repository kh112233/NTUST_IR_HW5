  [Text] Military activities by Jonas Savimbi's men continue 
in the country. In Kuito the calm registered yesterday morning 
and afternoon was interrupted at dawn today with intense 
shellings by the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA]. By midmorning today, more than 200 shells had 
been fired against the city. More than 30 people have been 
killed by these shellings over the past 24 hours. Our 
correspondent Abel Abraao reports. 
  The people are still unable to come out in the streets in 
search of water, food, and firewood for their livelihood. 
Famine, just like the war, continues to kill people in Kuito. 
According to hospital sources, over the past 48 hours three 
children, five old people, and one pregnant women, totalling 
nine people, died of hunger at the hospital. The lack of 
medicines is also another problem facing the local people [words 
indistinct] by snipers determined to kill anyone trying to cross 
the street.
