Status of Environmental Analysis:

 This application has been accepted for filing and was previously noticed as ready for environmental analysis. Comments,
recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment were not solicited, however,
because we had not decided on whether the data and results from the entrainment studies completed for the Rothschild
Project No. 2212, Centralia Project No. 2255, and Wisconsin River Division Project No. 2590 could be extrapolated
to an environmental analysis of this project. We have determined that the data and results for the three other projects
can be extrapolated to this project. Therefore, we now request comments, recommendations, terms and conditions,
or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment for this project.
