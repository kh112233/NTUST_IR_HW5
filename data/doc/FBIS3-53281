  [Text] The bilateral peace talks in Washington will resume 
on the 24th of this month, with only some of the delegation 
heads taking part. This is according to an Israeli source 
speaking to reporters in the U.S. capital yesterday. Talks with 
Palestinians will not resume until the Taba talks are concluded, 
the source said. 
  Jordan's King Husayn is to meet with President Bill Clinton 
next week, a meeting considered no less important than Clinton's 
upcoming summit with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, said the 
Israeli source. 
  The Israeli source in Washington says that Israel will not 
be 
satisfied with slogans on peace from Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad when he meets U.S. President Clinton in Geneva. The 
source told Qol Yisra'el Jerusalem expects concrete steps, in 
particular on the issue of security arrangements. 
  Intelligence sources here in Israel believe the Syrians, for 
their part, have high hopes in advance of the summit. They say 
President al-Asad's entourage will include some 100 people, as 
compared to smaller teams that accompanied him when he met in 
the past with U.S. Presidents Bush and Carter.
