TAX REVOLT TIME 
If the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution were the shots heard 'round 
the world, then this Poll Tax Revolt in Great Britain should trigger a "read my 
lips" revolt against all the nickel-and-dime taxes in the U.S. But it won't 
because Americans have been so lulled that they will endure all kinds of 
political abuse. 
We must stop all this foolishness. A progressive income tax properly 
administered should cover all costs of providing services our citizens want and 
need. We must stop special taxes on gasoline, tobacco, alcohol and use taxes 
for purposes not relating to these taxes. 
Americans have just paid their various income taxes. Wasn't that enough?
