FT  17 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Medeva pays Pounds 9.3m for two hepatitis B
products
MEDEVA, UK pharmaceuticals group, has bought worldwide rights to two
hepatitis B products for about Pounds 9.3m.
Mr Ian Gowrie-Smith, managing director, said the acquisitions continued the
programme of acquiring and developing pharmaceutical products with a short
lead-time before they could be put on the market.
Medeva is paying SFr10m (Pounds 3.86m) immediately to Epitec and GA
Investments.
The balance is dependent on successful completion of further development
work and reaching some registration milestones in European countries.
One product is a vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis B. It is in
late-stage clinical development and the early phases of regulatory approval.
Current estimates of the size of the market for this product are Pounds
150m, Medeva said.
The other product is a treatment for chronic hepatitis caused by the
hepatitis B virus. This is in early clinical development and will reach the
market in five years.
Medeva said it would probably seek a partner to develop the second
treatment.
Meanwhile, Mr Bernard Taylor, executive chairman, said the company's
unbranded generic businesses were for sale, adds Paul Abrahams.
These include a small part of the Pounds 85m Evans acquisition in January
1990, and Thomas Kerfoot which Medeva bought for Pounds 10m in September
1990. Mr Taylor said the businesses were holding their own.
