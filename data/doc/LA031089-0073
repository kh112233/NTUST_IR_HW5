FAA TO GIVE BUSIEST AIR CONTROLLERS BIG RAISES IN BID TO IMPROVE SAFETY 
More than 2,000 air traffic controllers and other Federal Aviation 
Administration employees will receive pay raises of up to 20% under a program 
that Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said Thursday is aimed at 
increasing air safety. 
The additional pay is to take effect on June 1 at 11 of the FAA's busiest 
facilities -- those that monitor air traffic over the New York, Chicago, Los 
Angeles and Oakland areas. FAA officials say they have had difficulty staffing 
their most complex facilities. 
The increases, called "retention allowances," will go to 2,100 controllers, 
inspectors and technicians for a five-year experimental period and may be 
extended to other FAA operations, a Transportation Department news release 
said. The FAA has about 19,000 controllers and other personnel working in air 
safety at more than 460 sites. 
"Facilities which have the most complex operations, the most chronic staffing 
difficulties and the most impact on the overall national aviation system are 
included in the demonstration project," Skinner said. 
He said that the additional pay "will help us achieve our goal of a safer and 
more efficient national aviation system." 
A majority of the affected employees are air traffic controllers. Others are 
aviation safety inspectors and technicians who service computers and other 
equipment used to monitor air traffic. 
Facilities where the increases will take effect are the Air Route Traffic 
Control Centers in Aurora, Ill., and Ronkonkoma, N. Y.; the Chicago O'Hare and 
Los Angeles international airports; the Oakland and Santa Ana, Calif., and the 
Westbury, N. Y., terminal radar approach control facilities, and the flight 
standards district offices in Los Angeles, Teterboro, N. J., and Farmingdale 
and Valley Stream, N. Y.
