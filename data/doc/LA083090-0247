BONN PLEDGES LIMIT ON SIZE OF UNITED GERMAN MILITARY 
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher removed one of the last 
political obstacles to German reunification today by pledging to limit the 
armed forces of a united Germany. 
In a speech to the 23-nation Conventional Forces in Europe talks, Genscher 
promised that his government will keep united German military strength to a 
ceiling of 370,000 within three or four years. 
The new ceilings, worked out during talks between West German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in July, would cut by nearly 
half the combined forces of East and West Germany. 
"We Germans know that German unification must not be allowed to cause a shift 
in the balance of power in Europe and to harm the security interests of any 
country in Europe," Genscher told delegates to the CFE talks. 
"The government of the Federal Republic of Germany reaffirms that peace alone 
will emanate from German soil," he said. 
The West German pledge, supported by East Germany, was a response to Soviet 
concern about the military potential of Germany, which is set to unite Oct. 3. 
Genscher urged the delegates from NATO and Warsaw Pact countries to intensify 
efforts to overcome remaining obstacles and conclude a first-stage arms treaty 
by early October.
