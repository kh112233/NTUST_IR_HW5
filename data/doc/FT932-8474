FT  19 MAY 93 / BT agrees payout over RSI claims
BT AND the National Communications Union yesterday agreed on an out-of-court
settlement over the case of 11 former data processing officers who
contracted repetitive strain injury.
Without admitting liability BT has agreed to make payments to the women
concerned and meet the union's legal costs. Neither side would disclose the
amount involved.
Mr Tony Young, the NCU's general secretary, said yesterday: 'Our members
will receive proper compensation.'
Mr Peter Archer, BT's employee relations director, said he was pleased a
settlement had been reached. 'When we started down this long, legal road
both sides believed this case would be seen as a test case for RSI injury
claims linked with keyboard work. When we studied the judgment we realised
it would not.'
In December 1991 the Mayor and City of London court ruled that the keyboard
operation was partly the cause of RSI among the 11, employed at Cardiff and
Swindon in the early 1980s, but that this was not due to BT's negligence.
The company had not been aware of the danger at the time.
A hearing scheduled for the Appeal Court this week has been deferred
indefinitely. About 90 other RSI claims against BT are also likely to be
resolved without recourse to the courts.
Mr Jim Moher, the union's chief legal officer, said BT had agreed to hold
joint discussions on establishing guidelines for dealing with the other RSI
compensation claims.
