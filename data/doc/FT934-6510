FT  24 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Emerging market investment
rises
International institutional investment in emerging stock markets has risen
to 13 per cent of international funds this year from 10 per cent last year,
according to a survey* published yesterday. This compares with only 2 per
cent in 1989.
The survey also showed investor attention had shifted from leading Latin
American and Pacific Rim markets to lesser-known markets in Africa, the
Middle East and Europe. In 1990, only 7 per cent of respondents had holdings
in Africa and the Middle East but this figure is now 50 per cent. Markets in
southern and central Europe are now part of 85 per cent of portfolios, an
increase of 20 per cent.
Thirty per cent of survey respondents have committed funds to Poland and 14
per cent have invested in Zimbabwe, the Czech Republic and Morocco. A
handful of investors have entered Ghana, Botswana, Ecuador and Panama. They
have also taken direct equity stakes in local companies in Papua New Guinea,
which does not have a stock market as yet.
Survey respondents said that although investing in emerging markets had
become 'fashionable', several areas of practical concern remained in these
high risk-high reward markets.
These included inadequate custody and settlement, bureaucratic regulatory
environments and the lack of quality information. Venezuela, China, India
and the Czech Republic were cited as the main markets where investors
encountered these problems.
More than 40 institutional investors and several large pension fund advisers
from North America, Europe and Japan took part in the survey.
