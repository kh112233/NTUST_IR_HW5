SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is announcing the availability of the 1992 revised informal labeling guidance texts for professional and patient
labeling for estrogen drug products. The 1992 revisions reflect updated scientific information, particularly
pertaining to the relationship between estrogen replacement therapy and reduction of cardiovascular risk. Although,
the agency has distributed copies of the 1992 labeling guidance on a case-by-case basis, it is announcing its availability
now to ensure more widespread distribution.


Under 21 CFR 314.70(c), a holder of an approved application for a new drug is required to submit a supplemental application
to obtain approval for the following changes, among others, in the text of professional or patient labeling: to add
or strengthen contraindications, warnings, precautions, or adverse reactions, or to add or strengthen dosage and
administration instructions to increase the safe use of the product. Manufacturers and other persons can refer to
the labeling guidance texts for assistance in preparing supplemental applications to meet the labeling requirements
of 21 CFR 310.515 for estrogen drug products and 21 CFR 201.56, 201.57, and 201.100 for professional labeling of prescription
drug products. In the 

Federal Register

 of May 4, 1990 (55 FR 18761), the agency announced the revocation of guideline texts of professional and patient labeling
for estrogen drug products. The agency determined that the time period to finalize and announce revised guidelines
prevented the agency from providing the most current medical information to manufacturers and others. Therefore,
in place of guidelines, the agency announced that it would provide assistance in meeting labeling requirements in
the form of informal labeling guidance texts. 
Labeling guidance texts are informal documents. They do not bind or otherwise obligate the agency or a person referring
to them and are not formal agency opinions. The agency does not require manufacturers printing professional and patient
package inserts to follow the labeling guidance texts. Manufacturers and others are free to use an alternative or
modified approach, although they are encouraged to consult with the Division of Metabolism and Endocrine Drug Products
(address above) before drafting alternative labeling so that any differences can be resolved prior to the submission
of a supplemental application, if such an application is required under 21 CFR 314.70. 
Interested persons may submit written comments concerning the informal labeling guidance texts to the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy.
Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments
may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
