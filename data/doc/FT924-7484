One thousand black people have been killed in South Africa so far this year,
but they did not die by 'falling out of the window' or 'tripping down the
stairs' while being 'guarded' by white men in police stations. They died in
the war between the Inkatha Zulus and the supporters of Nelson Mandela's
ANC. It is difficult (not impossible, if you are good at contortions, but
still difficult) to pin the entire blame for this on white people and their
old apartheid policies. Consequently there has been a dramatic drop in the
number of 'investigative' programmes made in South Africa by white
journalists with back of hand to forehead and heart on sleeve. To its great
credit Assignment at 7.45 on BBC2 investigates what it calls 'the civil war
which now threatens to engulf the whole of South Africa'.
In Troubleshooter 2 (9.50 BBC2) Sir John Harvey-Jones looks at the Donner
family business and is astounded at the capital tied up in a warehouse
packed with cloth. This is the raw material for the Double Two shirt
business. Although Donner makes a profit the shirt company makes a loss, and
Sir John advises against plans to try to expand into Europe.
