FT  24 FEB 94 / Islamic militants admit attack on Egyptian train
Islamic militants yesterday claimed responsibility for an attack on a train
in Upper Egypt in which an explosive device slightly injured 11 people, six
of them foreign tourists, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo.
The Gamaa al-Islamiyya, a militant Islamic group which has warned tourists
to avoid Egypt for their own safety, said the attack was in retaliation for
death sentences handed out by a military court on three men charged with
attempting to assassinate President Hosni Mubarak. A bomb also exploded
outside a Cairo bank, a day after a Gamaa al-Islamiyya deadline for
depositors to withdraw their money from banks which pay interest. No one was
hurt.
