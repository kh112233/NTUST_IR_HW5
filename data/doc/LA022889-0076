Four Merced-area people were killed when their car went around railroad 
crossing barriers and was torn in two by an Amtrak train going nearly 75 
m.p.h., the California Highway Patrol said. No one on the northbound train was 
reported injured in the Sunday evening accident at Le Grand. After a short 
delay, the train continued its trip from Bakersfield to Oakland. The Merced 
County coroner's office identified the victims as Shane Littleton, 18, Rhonda 
Carol Gideon, 21, and Walter Luke Encalade, 29, all of Merced, and Paul Ince, 
27, of Le Grand. A CHP officer said all apparently died on impact. He said a 
paper bag filled with beer cans was found at the scene.
