FT  15 DEC 94 / Judge defers ruling on tobacco liability
A judge in New Orleans yesterday deferred a decision on a landmark lawsuit
against the US tobacco industry, saying he wanted more information about how
the plaintiffs would pursue their multi-billion dollar claims.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs are trying to create a class of present and
former smokers claiming to have been addicted to cigarettes at any time in
the last 50 years. Yesterday they said the damages could range from Dollars
30bn to Dollars 50bn.
Mr John Coale, representing one of the plaintiffs, said outside the court
that if the class included 30m smokers and each were awarded damages of
Dollars 10,000, the damages would reach Dollars 300bn. 'But I don't think
the courts will let someone bankrupt the US tobacco industry,' Mr Coale
said.
At the hearing, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of
Louisiana, the main arguments turned on whether there was enough common
ground between the cases of tens of millions of individual smokers to make a
class action feasible.
