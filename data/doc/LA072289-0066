TRAIN CARRYING CRASH SURVIVORS KILLS BOY, 6 
An Amtrak train carrying survivors of the crash of a United Airlines jetliner 
in Sioux City, Iowa, Friday struck and killed a 6-year-old boy who was crossing 
the tracks in Cheriton, Iowa, Amtrak officials said. 
The California Zephyr hit Jason Lee Howie as the boy walked his bicycle across 
the railroad tracks, an Amtrak spokesman said. The train, which picked up 
survivors from Wednesday's crash of Flight 232 in Omaha, arrived at Chicago's 
Union Station late Friday.
