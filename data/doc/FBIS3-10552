  [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella was not the only 
Argentine official to leave the presidential delegation in Spain 
to travel to London: Employing the subtlety required by his 
position, SIDE [State Intelligence Secretariat] Chief Hugo 
Anzorreguy also boarded a plane for London Heathrow Airport. 
  Once in London, Anzorreguy contacted the British 
intelligence 
chiefs. The gesture would have been nothing more than a 
protocol issue had this not been the first such contact since 
the South Atlantic War in 1982. 
  The gradual thawing of Argentine-British relations, which 
was 
crowned by the resumption of diplomatic relations between the 
two countries almost four years ago, had not occurred between 
the two countries' intelligence organizations. 
  Military and police officers, however, did make contact 
(when 
charges of alleged executions after the Longdon Hill battle were 
being investigated), while Argentine and British officers and 
NCOs who participate in the UN peace forces did fraternize.
