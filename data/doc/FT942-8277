FT  21 MAY 94 / Goldman Sachs to assist with rating
South Africa has appointed Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, to assist
the country in acquiring an international credit rating. Mr Derek Keys,
South Africa's finance minister, said yesterday that a formal long-term
credit rating would be the most tangible step towards the country's return
to the international capital markets.
Bankers said South Africa was likely to make submissions to Moody's and
Standard &amp; Poor's, the two leading international rating agencies. The rating
process would at least a few months to complete, they added.
South Africa is thought to be keen to obtain an investment-grade rating
which would facilitate its access to the international bond market and to
the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers.
Bankers said South Africa's infrastructure was more advanced than other
'emerging markets' but these achievements were offset by the country's
political risk and the high unemployment.
