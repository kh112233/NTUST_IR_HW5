Transrapid in March"] 
  [Text] The Federal Cabinet will decide at the end of March 
this year whether or not to build the Transrapid fast maglev 
line between Berlin and Hamburg, Federal Transport Minister 
Matthias Wissmann (CDU [Christian Democratic Union]) has told 
DIE WELT. He also said that he intended to introduce the maglev 
railway bill in the Bundestag before the end of the current 
parliamentary term. The coalition parties approve of the 
project, so it may safely be assumed that the bill will be 
passed. 
  "I want work on building the Transrapid to begin within 
three 
or four years," said Wissmann. If the high-technology line were 
built in 1997 and 1998, it could enter service between 2002 and 
2004. The idea was to bring the train into the centers of both 
cities on Bundesbahn tracks. Wissmann expects the Transrapid 
and the work associated with it to create about 10,000 new jobs: 
"The Transrapid is a symbol of our capacity not only to develop 
advanced technology in Germany but to apply it for all to see," 
said the minister. 
  In view of mounting interest in the supertrain on the world 
markets, he said, it was particularly important for the 
Transrapid actually to run between Germany's capital and its 
second-largest city. No time should therefore be wasted. 
"Interest is mounting abroad. We currently have about five 
years' technological lead over the Japanese with the 
Transrapid," the minister reported. The Transrapid can reach a 
top speed of over 400 kilometers per hour and would complete the 
285-km journey in under an hour. Track costs are currently put 
at 5.6 billion German marks [DM], and the fare is estimated at 
DM90 to 100.
