FT  17 DEC 93 / Mexico City rail contract awarded
A consortium of Mexican construction companies and Bombardier, the Canadian
transport group, has won the concession to build and operate an urban
railway system in Mexico City at a cost of about Dollars 650m (Pounds 436m).
The light railway will be the first large public transport project in Mexico
that has been handed over to the private sector. The consortium will operate
the railway for 18 years and eight months, collect all revenues from
passengers, and assume financial risk of the investment.
The service will connect the north-west of Mexico City with the centre,
cover about 21km and include 27 stations. It is estimated that the railway
will take about 50,000 cars off the road each day, and help reduce Mexico
City's notoriously high pollution levels.
The winning consortium is made up of Tribasa, Grupo Mexicano de Desarollo
and Rioboo. Bombardier will supply about Dollars 300m of the equipment and
is expected to provide some of the financing through loans from Canadian
banks and the country's export-import bank.
While Tribasa and its partners have been chosen by the government for the
project, the terms and conditions of the contract still have to be
negotiated and full financing obtained. However Tribasa did not foresee any
problems that would prevent the project going ahead.
The train service should be ready by the end of 1996 or early 1997. Tribasa
and partners are expected to charge users about Dollars 1 per ride, much
higher than the tariff on the subsidised and state-owned underground system.
After the concession expires, the train service reverts to the government.
Tribasa reckons the government will award concessions for further light
railway lines in Mexico City in the near future.
