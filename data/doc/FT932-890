FT  26 JUN 93 / The EBRD - Attali Resigns: 'He had the vision. But he was,
well, just a bit arrogant' / The fall of Jacques Attali
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's board room, which is
a quarter of the size of a football pitch, was an appropriate venue for Mr
Jacques Attali's farewell.
The onslaught of criticism faced by Mr Attali in the past three months began
on April 13, when the Financial Times disclosed that the bank had spent
Pounds 200m on itself in its first two years, including Pounds 55.5m fitting
out its City of London headquarters. Of this sum, several millions had been
spent on the boardroom, including its oval designer desk, sophisticated
translation facilities and trompe l'oeil book case.
At 10.30am yesterday, Mr Attali entered the boardroom and told the bank's 23
directors, who represent the 56 countries and agencies which own the bank,
that he had decided to resign. 'The attacks have been growing day by day,'
he said. 'It is better for the institution that I take this decision.'
Most of the directors received the news in silence. Many were relieved,
concerned at the tide of bad publicity and convinced that new management is
required. But of the three who did speak out, all offered praise. 'Thank you
for what you have done for the bank,' Mr Guiseppe Maresca, the Italian
director, told the meeting. 'This board will take care of your baby.'
Mr Maresca was paraphrasing Mr Attali, who at the annual meeting at the end
of April had referred to the bank as his 'baby'. It was partly as a result
of his initiative that the EBRD had been set up in April 1991.
His original vision was that the EBRD should be a publicly- owned
institution which assessed its investments as rigorously as a blue chip
investment bank, while being explicitly motivated by the political goal of
promoting democracy and free markets in the fledgling private sector of the
former Soviet bloc.
It was a vision unique and complex as the man himself. Mr Attali had never
worked as a banker, although he wrote a biography of Sir Siegmund Warburg,
the founder of SG Warburg. But he chose to ignore one of his subject's main
strictures, that banks should never spend lavishly on their offices.
At the age of 49, friends say he still thinks of himself as an
anti-establishment figure, having been born into an Algerian Jewish family.
However, he was educated at France's elite National School of Public
Administration, his brother, Bernard, is chairman of Air France, and he
spent most of the 1980s as the special adviser to the French president, Mr
Francois Mitterrand.
His intellectual and physical appetite is legendary. He has published 16
books and starts work before dawn each day, although this has not prevented
him becoming an habitue of London nightspots.
But perhaps his most salient characteristic is his capacity to arouse
passions in others. 'People either love him or hate him,' said a close
colleague. 'You won't find many who are indifferent.' To some, he is
Renaissance man, to others a dilettante. There is evidence for both views.
On the one hand, he has probably been the west's most articulate analyst of
the problems faced by the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. On the
other, he has been accused - though he vehemently denies it - of plagiarism
in his new 960 page book, Verbatim, which records Mr Mitterrand's life at
the Elysee Palace from 1981 to 1986.
Perhaps inevitably, the EBRD's staff has been split between those, mostly
francophones, close to Mr Attali, and a group which felt itself outside the
charmed circle. 'There was a bank within a bank,' said one executive. 'In
terms of who wielded power, titles were less important than being a friend
of Mr Attali.'
This inner group included Mr Pierre Pissaloux, who originally held the roles
of both cabinet director and budget director, but who has since relinquished
his budget role, Mr Francois Olive, Mr Attali's personal assistant, Mr Guy
de Sellier, the deputy head of merchant banking and Mr Andre Newburg, the
general counsel.
Like many French statesmen, notably Mr Mitterrand, Mr Attali believes that
public buildings should be monuments. It would have been unthinkable for him
to scrimp on the bank's headquarters.
But the bank's US, UK and Australian employees and directors judged the
building's fitting out costs extravagant, notably the decision to replace
one type of brand new marble with another at a cost of more than Pounds
750,000. They were also angry at Mr Attali's use of private jets. In 1992,
the bank paid Pounds 739,000 for him to make 26 journeys by private aircraft
supplied by a Paris-based charterer, Air Entreprise. Some of the
destinations were well served by scheduled flights.
The bank's audit committee is now investigating whether proper procedures
were followed on the building and why Mr Attali used the private flights, as
well as examining other allegations of extravagance and loose financial
controls. A deadline of July 15 has been set for the report to go to the
EBRD's board.
However, the board's preoccupation in the past few weeks has been whether
the bank should change its philosophy of concentrating on making investments
in the private sector to devote more resources to developing the
infrastructure of eastern Europe.
This issue had become confused with the question of who should manage the
bank, since Mr Attali had presented a management reorganisation proposal
whose effect would have been to concentrate more resources on development
banking, or investing in infrastructure.
Level-headed debate within the bank on this issue became difficult, since Mr
Attali's plan was viewed by some as an attempt to reinforce his own
position. 'We were discussing personalities, rather than the issues,' said a
director.
The reorganisation also had the effect of demoting Mr Ron Freeman, the first
vice president and head of merchant banking, from number two to number four
in the bank. This plan, which is still under consideration by the board,
would have involved the appointment of Mr Ernest Stern, currently number two
at the World Bank, to the new post of EBRD chief operating officer and the
promotion of Mr Mario Sarcinelli, currently in charge of development banking
at the EBRD, to take charge of the budget and personnel.
The result was open warfare between Mr Attali's supporters and his
opponents. Mr Freeman, having in April written an article in the FT
defending the EBRD's expenditure on refurbishing its offices, felt betrayed.
'Morale here is terrible,' said one executive yesterday. 'The personnel
department has been inundated with resignation notices.'
The final external blow was a story in yesterday's FT that Mr Attali had
double-billed his expenses on a trip to Tokyo. Mr Attali wrote in his
resignation letter that he knew of 'no action that  .. in any way could be
worthy of reproach,' but he felt he had to go.
The obituaries, like the earlier reviews, will contain wildly varying views.
As one senior east European diplomat put it yesterday: 'He had the vision.
But he was, well, just a bit arrogant with us. I hope his successor is as
committed to integrating the two Europes.'
