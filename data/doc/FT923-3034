FT  15 SEP 92 / Italy pushes round-up of Mafia suspects
THE extradition from Venezuela over the weekend of the three Cuntrera
brothers, regarded as key figures in an international network of drugs and
money-laundering, has added to a string of recent successes by the Italian
authorities in arresting suspected bosses of organised crime.
Over the past two weeks the bosses of six leading families running large
crime syndicates have been arrested or extradited, as in the case of the
Cuntreras.
These arrests attest to a tougher attitude by the Italian government
following the brutal assassinations of the country's two principal
anti-mafia magistrates, Mr Giovane Falcone and Mr Paolo Borsellino. This
tougher attitude has led to many an ironic comment about the authorities'
previous complicity in allowing them to be free. But it is also the result
of increased use of 'super-grass' testimony from former mafia members.
Another factor is believed to be increased rivalry between clans operating
organised crime syndicates. Some press commentaries have also speculated
that those being caught after being on the wanted list for up to 10 years
are no longer significant figures and have been pushed aside by new clans.
The Italian government had previously submitted three extradition requests
to the Venezuelan government - in 1983, 1985 and 1990 - for Pasquale, Paolo
and Gaspare Cuntrera. All were denied.
In the final days before his assassination in June, Mr Borsellino had been
on their trail, while the late Mr Falcone had always insisted on the
importance of bringing them to justice.
