  [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Taiwan's tourism revenues 
reached US$695 million in the first quarter of this year, the 
highest quarterly figure for the past five years, the Central 
Bank of China (CBC) reported Wednesday [1 June]. 
  During the same period, overseas travel spending amounted to 
US$1.82 billion, according to CBC statistics. 
  As a result, Taiwan still incurred a tourism deficit of 
US$1.13 billion during the January-March period. 
  Taiwan's overseas travel bills have increased rapidly in 
recent years as more people go abroad for sightseeing and 
shopping. Government tallies show Taiwan residents spent US$7.6 
billion on overseas pleasure trips in 1993, nearly equal to 
Taiwan's total foreign trade surplus of US$7.85 billion for the 
year. 
  Meanwhile, the Tourism Bureau reported that the occupancy 
rate at local tourist hotels reached 58.15 percent in the first 
quarter of this year, up 6.69 percent from the year-earlier 
level. 
  Tourist arrivals hit a high of 525,000 during the 
three-month 
period, an increase of 19 percent from the year before, the 
bureau said. 
  It attributed the rise partly to a new government measure to 
allow 120-hour visa-free stays for visitors from the United 
States, Japan, France, Britain, Germany, Austria, Holland, 
Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
