FT  26 AUG 92 / 18% jump in visitors to Northern Ireland
THE NUMBER of visitors to Northern Ireland increased by 18 per cent to
263,000 last year, the province's tourist board said yesterday.
Mr Hugh O'Neill, board chairman, said the numbers had more than doubled over
three years but the government target was for more than 400,000
holidaymakers by 1994.
Self-catering, bed and breakfast accommodation and touring caravan and
camping sites reported big increases in business, although hotel occupancy
fell by 1 per cent.
The board's annual report says that holidaymakers are spending less because
of the recession and the domestic market is weak.
There was also a disappointing level of visitors from the US but Mr O'Neill
said: 'We nevertheless believe that 1992 will be the best ever year for
overseas visitors and for tourism revenue.'
