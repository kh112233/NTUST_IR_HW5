FT  04 JUN 93 / Funerals of turks killed in Solingen
COFFINS of five Turks killed in a racist attack in Solingen, Germany, are
carried yesterday in front of their burnt-out house. Several thousand people
gathered in front of Cologne's largest mosque to mourn their deaths, writes
Ariane Genillard. Addressing the crowd, President Richard von Weizsacker -
Chancellor Helmut Kohl stayed away - called on Germany's 1.8m Turks to be
granted dual citizenship. 'We do not want to stamp as foreigners those who
for years and decades have proven that Germany is also their home.' The
president also clearly pointed to political motives behind the series of
racist attacks. Later in the day, more than 20 young people were arrested
after further race-based rioting in Cologne and other German cities.
