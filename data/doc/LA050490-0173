WORLD; 
6 KILLED IN MEXICO RAIL CRASH 
A passenger train derailed and plunged into a dry riverbed in the southern 
state of Oaxaca, killing at least six people, the Mexican Red Cross said today. 
The organization originally gave a death toll from Thursday night's crash of at 
least 40. Ana Maria Tovar, director of the Red Cross in Oaxaca, today blamed 
the discrepancy on the magnitude of the wreck, the isolation of the area and 
the circumstance that the crash occurred at night. 
There were no reports of foreigners among the victims.
