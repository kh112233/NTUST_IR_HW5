  [Text] Frankfurt--By means of supercritical liquid 
extraction, British scientists have extracted a highly porous 
form of silicon which emits visible light. The aerocrystals are 
stable and should therefore be suitable as material for optical 
electronics. 
  Two years ago the group around Leigh Canham at DRA Malvern 
in 
Worcester (WR14 3PS, Great Britain) produced luminescent silicon 
crystals for the first time. At the time the researchers used an 
electrochemical etching method and obtained a porous material 
which consisted of 90-percent air. 
  In order to make the aerogels even lighter and improve their 
luminescent properties, the British scientists have now added 
another step to the procedure. The ethanol which remained in the 
pores of the porous silicon layers, obtained by means of an 
electrochemical process, was slowly replaced under pressure by 
adding liquid carbon dioxide. 
  With increasing pressure and higher temperature the pores in 
the silicon layer expanded and finally yielded an aerogel that 
consisted of more than 95-percent air. Until now the method of 
supercritical drying had been applied primarily in the 
production of porous ceramics, but not yet in silicon technology. 
  The airy silicon layers could, as their inventors write in 
the British scientific journal NATURE (vol 368, p 133), lead to 
dramatic improvements in the development of optoelectronic 
materials.
