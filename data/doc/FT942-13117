FT  26 APR 94 / Manila accused over software
The Philippines has one of the world's worst records for pirating computer
software, an alliance of the world's leading software companies said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Manila.
Mr Ron Eckstrom, vice-president of the Business Software Association (BSA),
said about 99 per cent of computer software in the Philippines was pirated
or illegally copied and distributed. This translates to losses of tens of
millions of dollars, he told a business conference.
Mr Eckstrom gave no exact figures for the losses but said they compared with
Indonesia and Thailand which both showed 99 per cent incidence of illegal
use of software programmes. BSA estimates that losses from software copying
and counterfeiting amount to Dollars 14bn a year, or 33 per cent of their
global revenues.
