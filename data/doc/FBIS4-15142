  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 06, BNS -- Estonia must try to 
re-channel its farm exports from Russia to other countries as 
much as is possible, Agriculture Minister Jaan Leetsar said in 
his comments on a meeting of farm unions and producers 
associations, held on Tuesday [5 April]. 
  Russia has introduced imports tariffs on products from the 
Baltics, effective from Apr. 15, two times the level at which it 
tariffs goods from most other European countries. 
  Estonia's exporters should become organized and step up 
activity in the countries outside Russia's borders, as well as 
on Estonia's own domestic market, Leetsar said. 
  The Agriculture Ministry together with the Foreign Ministry 
are now trying to start negotiations with Russia on cutting down 
the tariffs to an equal level with other European countries, the 
minister said. 
  The meeting on Tuesday also discussed possible introduction 
of tariff barriers to protect the domestic market in Estonia, 
but since the market is not completely saturated with 
Estonian-made products and there is no political readiness for 
such a step, no move was made past discussion, he added.
