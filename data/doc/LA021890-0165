A motorist apparently ignored flashing signal lights at a Hawthorne railroad 
crossing and drove into the path of a freight train, killing a passenger in her 
car and injuring herself, authorities said Saturday. 
The accident occurred late Friday on Southern Pacific railroad tracks at Van 
Ness Boulevard south of 120th Street, according to the California Highway 
Patrol. 
The driver, Patricia Knight, 19, of Inglewood, was taken to Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center with unspecified injuries. 
Authorities said they will seek vehicular manslaughter charges against Knight 
when she recovers. 
The identity of her 20-year-old passenger was not disclosed pending 
notification of relatives.
