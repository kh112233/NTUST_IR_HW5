CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
SACRAMENTO; 
2 PLEAD INNOCENT IN CAPITOL STING CASE 
A former legislative aide and a one-time lobbyist pleaded innocent to charges 
growing out of the FBI's investigation of state Capitol corruption. Tyrone 
Netters, 36, a former aide to Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), is 
charged with nine counts of racketeering, extortion, conspiracy, 
money-laundering and tax evasion. 
Darryl Freeman, 43, the former lobbyist, is named in two counts of conspiracy 
and extortion. U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton set a tentative trial date 
for the pair for June 4. During the elaborate three-year sting investigation, 
FBI agents posed as businessmen seeking legislative favors. Moore sponsored two 
bills that would have helped the phony businessmen, but prosecutors earlier 
announced that she will not be prosecuted. Netters is accused of taking money 
to help shepherd the bills through the Assembly. Freeman worked as a lobbyist 
for the FBI's bogus firm.
