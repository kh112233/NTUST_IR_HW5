  [Text] Reports have been circulating in Beijing that 
detained Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang may be freed sometime 
soon, perhaps within days. China adviser [on Hong Kong affairs] 
Zhu Zhimin told journalists that Xi was tried and convicted in 
mid-February. He is expected to be given a suspended sentence. 
That would mean that the MING PAO journalist would be freed 
immediately and allowed to return to Hong Kong with his employer 
acting as guarantor. 
  Xi Yang was arrested in Beijing last September and charged 
with stealing state secrets.
