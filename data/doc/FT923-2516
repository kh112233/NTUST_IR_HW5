FT  17 SEP 92 / Technology: Fighting the war with magic bullets - Continuing
a series on drug discoveries, Clive Cookson looks at cancer treatments that
destroy tumours but save healthy tissue
a drug that destroys tumour cells without harming healthy tissues - has been
one of the longest-postponed promises of medical research. Now at last,
after four decades of patchy progress, several candidate bullets are
undergoing clinical trials and they could be available commercially within
five years.
The idea of using the immune system to create antibodies specific enough to
seek out and eliminate disease-causing cells, without doing any other
damage, was proposed 90 years ago by the German microbiologist Paul Ehrlich.
And anti-cancer antibodies linked to radioactive iodine were first tested in
the 1950s at the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Institute in the US.
There were a few promising experiments during the 1950s and 1960s but the
'polyclonal' mixtures of antibodies available at the time did not give
reliable results. The real excitement started in the late 1970s, after
scientists at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge
discovered how to make pure 'monoclonal' antibodies. Researchers could then
produce large quantities of identical antibodies, all designed to home in on
a single target.
The first generation of antibody-based cancer products is now reaching the
market. They are magic paints rather than magic bullets - diagnostic tests
to give doctors a more accurate image of the tumour than traditional methods
such as physical examination or X-rays.
The tests contain antibodies which bind to proteins that are found only on a
specific type of cancer cell; they are linked to radioactive isotopes whose
radiation is detected outside the body with a special camera.
The first such test to receive marketing approval - an imaging agent for
colo-rectal cancer produced by Cytogen of New Jersey - went on sale in
Europe at the end of last year. Although the US Food and Drug Administration
has not yet licensed an antibody-based cancer imaging test, several are
expected to receive FDA approval within the next year or so, including one
for lung cancer from NeoRx of Seattle.
The development of antibody-based drugs, designed not to show up cancer
cells but to destroy them, has been slower. However a variety of drugs are
now in clinical trials, following recent progress towards overcoming some of
the problems that held up research during the 1980s.
Monoclonal antibodies were originally made from mouse cells which provoked
an unwanted immune response in patients. As a result, many of the antibodies
were destroyed before they reached their target. The solution is to make
genetically engineered 'humanised antibodies' in which only the active site
that binds to the cancer cell comes from the mouse and the remainder is
human. For example the Campath-1H antibody, developed at Cambridge
University and now undergoing clinical trials with Wellcome, the UK drug
company, contains only 1 per cent rodent material and does not provoke any
adverse reaction.
To the immune system, cancer cells look extremely similar to normal cells.
There has been a serious shortage of distinctive 'marker' proteins which
distinguish the tumour well enough to make it a clear target for an antibody
drug, and some of the early candidates cross-reacted unexpectedly with
normal tissues. Steadily, however, researchers are discovering better
markers. And once a diagnostic antibody against a distinctive marker has
been made, it can often be developed into a drug.
Only small quantities of antibodies can reach cells inside solid tumours
with poor blood supplies. Researchers are testing various techniques for
getting larger amounts of antibody to the site where it is needed. One
method is to 'pre-load' or 'pre-target' the tumour with a non-toxic marker
antibody and then to administer a second antibody to kill the marked cells.
The bullets are becoming more lethal. There are three ways in which an
antibody-based drug can destroy a cell: knock it out with radiation from an
isotope; poison it with a toxic drug; or activate the immune system's
natural cell-killing mechanism. The problems which exist with all three
methods are gradually being tackled.
In principle, the most elegant and safest approach is to use the antibody to
activate the body's own killer cells. Wellcome's Campath-1H, which is now
being tested on about 50 lymphoma patients, works in this way. And
biotechnology companies are trying different ways of boosting the natural
mechanism.
For example, Medarex, based in New Jersey, is developing 'bispecific'
antibodies - two antibodies joined together, one of which binds to the
cancer cell and the other which directs killer cells towards the target. The
company plans to test them next year in patients with melanoma, the most
lethal skin cancer, and glioma and neuroblastoma, two cancers of the brain
and nervous systems.
But antibodies on their own are not powerful enough to destroy most solid
tumours. For these, the antibody has to be linked to a radioactive isotope -
the traditional approach - or to a toxin. Then there is a risk of serious
side effects if the warhead becomes detached before reaching its target;
much research effort over the past 15 years has been devoted to finding ways
of joining the isotope or toxin firmly to the antibody without interfering
with its power to bind to cancer cells.
Several different isotopes are being tested, including iodine-131,
yttrium-90, astatine-211 and indium-111. NeoRx is developing products based
on rhenium-186, starting with an ovarian cancer treatment.
The range of powerful drugs and toxins linked to experimental antibodies is
even greater. A favourite is ricin, one of the most powerful plant toxins
known - a single molecule will kill a cell. Companies developing
ricin-linked antibodies include ImmunoGen of Massachusetts, whose Oncolysin
B has been tested on leukaemia and lymphoma patients, and ICI of the UK,
whose D0490 is about to start clinical trials.
Celltech of the UK and American Cyanamid of the US are collaborating on
another promising project: an antibody linked to calicheamicin, a potent
cytotoxic drug derived originally from fungi. It is due to begin clinical
studies in leukaemia and breast cancer patients within the next few months.
An alternative approach, pioneered by Kenneth Bagshawe at London's Charing
Cross Hospital, with funding from the Cancer Research Campaign, is
Antibody-Directed Enzyme/Prodrug Therapy (Adept). This is a two-stage
process: the patient is treated first with an antibody linked to a bacterial
enzyme and later with a 'prodrug' - a chemical that is relatively non-toxic
but is converted by the enzyme into a potent cell-killing drug. Small-scale
clinical trials of Adept treatments against colo-rectal cancer have been
taking place for the past 18 months, in collaboration with ICI.
Despite the recent progress, however, more research is required to hone
antibodies into reliable cancer drugs. 'Antibody engineering' will make it
possible to design artificial antibodies - far smaller and more accurate
bullets than anything available today.
Another possibility is to use a hormone or growth factor instead of an
antibody to guide toxins to receptor sites on cancer cells. The company
pioneering this approach is Seragen, based in Massachusetts, which is
testing a range of 'fusion toxins', consisting of diphtheria toxins linked
to interleukin or epidermal growth factor.
Since conventional chemotherapy, radiation and surgery still fail to cure
most tumours, there is a potential market for innovative cancer treatments
worth several billion dollars a year. Although new genetic technologies -
anti-sense drugs and gene therapy - offer a promising alternative, magic
bullet enthusiasts will be disappointed if they are not selling at least
Dollars 2bn a year worth of cancer drugs within a decade.
The series continues next month with a look at heart drugs.
