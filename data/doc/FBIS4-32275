  [Text] Budapest, 22 Jun (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime Minister 
Peter Boross met Gyula Horn, prime minister designate of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party, and Ivan Peto, Chairman of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats, at Parliament today. 
  After the hour-long consultation, Horn told journalists that 
the topics discussed included having the two deputy presidents 
leave Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television. The deputies 
have been in charge of broadcasting since a dispute last year 
where both the TV and Radio presidents resigned amid allegations 
of bias. The prime minister announced some days ago that he 
would start the process of relieving deputies Laszlo Csucs and 
Gabor Nahlik. 
  "This job has to be done by the government in office," Horn 
said. "The prime minister promised that he would submit a 
proposal for relieving the deputy presidents to the 
parliamentary committee concerned. Until a new government is 
formed, the two broadcasting offices will be temporarily headed 
by commissioners, Horn said. 
  Peto added "this would be a reassuring solution for the few 
days until the new government appoints new media leaders."
