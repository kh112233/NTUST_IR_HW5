The written comments submitted by interested parties and other material available to the Department relevant to
this proposed revision were reviewed by NIST. On the basis of this review, NIST recommended that the Secretary approve
the revised standard as Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) 1401, and prepared
a detailed justification document for the Secretary's review in support of that recommendation.

The detailed justification document which was presented to the Secretary is part of the public record and is available
for inspection and copying in the Department's Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room 6020, Herbert
C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.

This FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability,
implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical
requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice.

This standard is effective on January 11, 1994.
