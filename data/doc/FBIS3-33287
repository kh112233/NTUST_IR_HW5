  [Text] The Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] has reported 
that it has disbanded a gang of swindlers which reportedly 
earned profits totaling about $3 million. This [word 
indistinct] organization has been acting parallel to the FELCN 
for approximately the last four years. 
  This organization had its own informers, and its own 
clandestine barracks. Three of the organization's informers 
were arrested. Among them are a former policeman and a former 
FELCN member who had detailed knowledge of the drug traffickers' 
activities. Those arrested have been identified as (Roger 
Gandarillas), (Felix Flores Aldin), and (Walter Orellana). 
(Roger Gandarillas) is reportedly the leader of the 
organization, which allegedly was able to swindle about $3 
million from the drug traffickers. 
  This gang, organized after the Colombian drug mafias, was 
made up of people who had detailed knowledge of all drug 
trafficking activities. They had identified all persons 
involved in drug trafficking activities, and their movements. 
  The organization seized drugs but instead of delivering them 
to the proper government organizations, it kept the seized cargo 
for itself and later distributed it. 
  FELCN officials, who added that the investigations continue, 
yesterday invited reporters to one of the properties that was 
seized from this organization. The property is located on 
Francisco Mora Avenue.
