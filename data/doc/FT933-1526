FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Gas fined over billing
irregularities in Argentina
BRITISH GAS, which operates Metrogas, the biggest gas distribution company
in Argentina, is to be fined between Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 65,000) and
Dollars 500,000 by Argentine government regulators for irregularities in
billing to consumers.
Mr Raul Garcia, head of Enargas, the regulator, said: 'We have noticed very
many complaints from clients about excessive billing by Metrogas', and
inspectors were investigating. However, an Enargas official said a decision
had been made in principle to fine the company but the final decision on the
amount would be taken once investigations were completed.
Metrogas, 29 per cent owned by British Gas, was privatised last December in
a Dollars 300m cash and debt for equity swap. It distributes gas in Buenos
Aires and nine surrounding districts.
Mr Rob Verrion, Metrogas president, said complaints stemmed from increased
consumption during the winter and higher than expected bills because of the
introduction of meter reading; previously, consumption was often understated
by estimated meter readings. Metrogas said complaints were running at only 3
per cent of the 45,000-80,000 invoices posted daily.
Mr Verrion claimed the investigation was politically motivated. He said
elections were due on October 3 and 'someone took it into their head to make
an issue of this.' He said Metrogas was a target as privatised companies
were the subject of 'many complaints because privatisation was sold as a
solution to problems and they're not. They're just the beginning of the
solution.'
