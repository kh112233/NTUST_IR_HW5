  [Text] Torreon, Coahuila, 16 May--Commander Juan Carlos 
Alvarado announced today that Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
forces succeeded in confiscating 253 packages of various shapes 
and sizes containing a total of 1,063 kg and 920 grams of 
marijuana. 
  The incident occurred at 1330 near Puerto Pinones, along the 
Zacatecas-Saltillo highway, while the drugs were being carried 
on a 1987 red Torton type truck with Federal District license 
plates. 
  The grass was concealed in a false compartment made of wood 
on the sides of the trailer, in the vehicle driven by Juan 
Manuel Barrera Reyes. He would admit only that he had left Agua 
Caliente, Zacatecas, bound for this capital. However, he claimed 
not to know the name of the shipment's owner nor that of the 
person for whom it was intended. 
  The police chief remarked that when the driver, Barrera 
Reyes, noticed the PJF agents' presence, he seemed very nervous, 
and accelerated the vehicle. It was stopped for inspection, with 
the aforementioned results. The incident was reported to the MP 
[Public Prosecutor's Office] agent, Roberto Lujan Sanchez, so 
that he might remand the subject to the district court in La 
Laguna.
