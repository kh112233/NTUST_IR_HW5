  [Text] Estonia's parliament, the Riigikogu, on Wednesday 
[6 April] approved a law regulating the transit and export of 
strategic goods. 
  "Undoubtedly, this is of no special interest to Estonia -- I 
think that during next decades we are not planning to supply us 
with such weapons," Estonia's Environment Minister Andres Tarand 
said on commenting the new law. 
  The law, however, enables Russia or some other foreign 
country sell missiles or other weapons to other countries 
through Estonian ports, Tarand said. 
  The law initiated by Estonian government regulates export 
and 
transit of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, Tarand said 
while adding he did not approve transit of such environmentally 
hazardous materials. Such activities, however, provided 
international rules are observed might bring Estonia economic 
benefits.
