FT  17 OCT 92 / Rights activist from Guatemala wins Nobel prize
MS RIGOBERTA Menchu Tum, the Guatemalan Indian and human rights activist,
yesterday won the 1992 Nobel peace prize.
The Nobel committee said Ms Menchu, a 33-year-old Mayan, stood out 'as a
vivid symbol of peace and reconciliation across ethnic, cultural and social
dividing lines, in her own country, on the American continent and in the
world'.
Ms Menchu is the ninth woman to win the Nobel peace prize. Detained Burmese
opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi won the award last year.
Mr Francis Sejersted, chairman of the Nobel committee, said the award to Ms
Menchu - on the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in
the new world - 'was not a coincidence, but it was not the only factor' in
the selection.
Ms Menchu said recently of the anniversary: 'There is nothing to celebrate'
as 'the rights of the Indian people continue to be violated'. She returned
to Guatemala last week and has been travelling around the country speaking
to indigenous groups and supporters.
It remained unclear last night whether she could go to Oslo on December 10
to receive the SKr6.5m (Pounds 688,750) award, diploma and gold medal.
Before she gained international recognition as a human rights activist Ms
Menchu worked in the cotton fields of Guatemala and as a domestic servant
for a wealthy family.
Her mother, father and brother were killed for their involvement in
indigenous rights movements. Fear of suffering the same fate has forced her
to live in self-imposed exile in Mexico City. Ms Menchu said last week she
would use the prize to set up a foundation in her father's memory.
Ms Menchu became an international figure when, in 1983, she published her
biography 'I, Rigoberta,' detailing her experiences in Guatemala's polarised
society.
In the book she told of how, during her time as a domestic servant for a
rich family, she was expected to have sex with the family's sons and was fed
worse than their dog.
'And they gave me a few beans and some hard tortillas. That hurt very much,
that the dog had eaten very well and I didn't deserve the food the dog ate,'
she wrote.
'I, Rigoberta,' now published in 10 languages, brought the plight of
indigenous people to the attention of Mrs Danielle Mitterrand, wife of
French President Francois Mitterrand, who became a strong Menchu supporter.
Mrs Mitterrand accompanied Ms Menchu to Guatemala last year when, for the
first time in a decade, she returned home.
Ms Menchu now works with the UN Working Group on Indigenous Populations and
the International Indian Treaty Council and spends much of her time in
Europe.
In 1986 she narrated the film When the Mountains Tremble, a powerful account
of the struggles and suffering of her native Quiche people.
The committee said that in Ms Menchu's social and political work, 'she has
always borne in mind that the long-term objective of the struggle is peace'.
Mr Sejersted conceded that perhaps not all Ms Menchu's civil rights efforts
were conducted peacefully, but as a whole the committee saw her work as
contributing to the development of human rights in a peaceful manner.
Despite her international prominence, the Guatemalan government treats Ms
Menchu as a pariah and accuses her of belonging to the country's leftist
guerrilla movement.
