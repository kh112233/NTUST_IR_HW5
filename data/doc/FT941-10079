FT  11 FEB 94 / Government defeated on Welsh council name
The government was defeated last night when peers voted to keep the ancient
name of Powys for a Welsh council.
The Lords divided by 88 to 60, a majority of 28, to retain the name instead
of replacing it with Mid Wales. The vote came during the report stage of the
Local Government (Wales) bill, which replaces the principality's eight
counties and 37 districts with 21 all-purpose authorities in 1996.
