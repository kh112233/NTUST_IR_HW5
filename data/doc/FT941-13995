FT  22 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: The market must decide
Sir, There is no doubt that the Elgin marbles 'housed in a museum (British)
which is universal in its scope. . .', 'constitute one of the greatest and
best-loved of its treasures' (Hawks &amp; Handsaws, January 15).
Personally, I am glad to admire them wherever they are. But I'm not quite
convinced about the method of payment the article proposes, 'if' the Greeks
were to buy them back. This is because, as it appears from your text, the
British do not seem to know if the Greek marbles were rescued by Lord Elgin
(according to the the British Museum's statement), or purchased, as Dr Susan
Walker, assistant keeper of Greek and Roman antiquities at the British
Museum, is quoted as suggesting.
I therefore propose that we should let the price of the marbles be fixed
according to whether the marbles were rescued, purchased, or stolen by Lord
Elgin, as history admits.
Let's get real, this should be the only criterion for both parties involved
(olives, feta cheese and the three islands demanded in your article shall be
gratis to the British because, thank God, we have plenty of each).
I'm afraid this is how the 'market' works.
