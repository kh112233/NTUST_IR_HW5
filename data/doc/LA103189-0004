WORLD IN BRIEF; 
JAPAN; 
NO. 1 CONSUMER OF IVORY BANS IMPORTS 
Bowing to growing international pressure to protect Africa's endangered 
elephants from extinction, Japan formally banned all imports of ivory. Japan 
has been the world's largest consumer of ivory. The decision was announced 
after high-ranking officials of government ministries and agencies concerned 
with ivory trade endorsed an earlier agreement reached by Cabinet ministers.
