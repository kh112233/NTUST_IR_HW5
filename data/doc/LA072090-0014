FUTURISTIC, HIGH-SPEED L.A.-PALMDALE TRAIN CONSIDERED 
A private partnership is considering submitting a bid to build a 280 m.p.h. 
magnetic-levitation train system from Los Angeles International Airport through 
the San Fernando Valley to Palmdale, serving commuters, airport-bound travelers 
and gamblers headed to Las Vegas. 
The futuristic line, which would be built along the San Diego, Golden State and 
Antelope Valley freeways, was endorsed Thursday by Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley. 
Bradley press spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor views the proposed line as 
a "means to allow thousands and thousands of commuters on the congested 405 and 
14 freeways to utilize rail transit." 
The proposal also could save the city's long-shot bid to be connected to a 
proposed Las Vegas-to-Anaheim magnetic-levitation system, said Clifton Moore, 
general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Airports. 
"This sounds like what we have been waiting for -- a way to open up Palmdale 
Airport," Moore said, adding that he will urge the city Board of Aiport 
Commissioners to endorse the plan at its meeting Wednesday because it offers 
long-sought relief for congestion at Los Angeles International Airport. 
But submission of the proposal, which faces formidable financial, technological 
and political hurdles, is "far from a sure thing," said a top executive at 
Perini Corp., the Framingham, Mass.-based construction firm that heads the 
consortium studying whether to submit a bid for a 65-mile LAX-to-Palmdale line. 
The plan was developed in response to a state program to encourage private 
construction of transportation facilities approved by the Legislature last 
year. 
Legislators authorized the state Department of Transportation to select up to 
four projects in which commercial firms would build and operate highways, 
tunnels, bridges or rail lines. 
Caltrans, which will provide the right of way without charge, will own the 
projects but the firms building them will lease back the facilities for up to 
35 years and will keep all tolls or fees. 
In January, Caltrans selected nine companies and partnerships it deemed 
qualified to make bids. The selections included Perini and several other major 
construction firms. 
Proposals are due Aug. 1 and Caltrans expects to select the top four candidates 
by Sept. 17. 
Henry Cygan, Perini's manager of product development, said Thursday that the 
consortium is "withholding a decision to submit or not submit until the last 
minute." 
He said no ridership studies have been completed. But he said his firm has 
concluded that "three types of riders would use the line in significant 
numbers." These were identified as work-bound commuters, those headed to LAX or 
Palmdale Airport and those transferring flights from one airport to another, 
and travelers to and from Las Vegas. 
The Las Vegas passengers would transfer in Palmdale to trains on the 41-mile 
Victor Valley-to-Palmdale spur off the proposed 265-mile Las Vegas-to-Anaheim 
system. 
Bechtel Corp. heads a consortium that on Monday proposed building a $5-billion 
magnetic-levitation line between the gambling mecca and Orange County that 
would largely follow the right of way of Interstate 15. 
The proposal is being evaluated by the California-Nevada Super Speed Train 
Commission. The commission was created by the legislatures in the two states to 
stimulate construction by a private firm of such a line by offering the right 
of way without charge. 
Los Angeles officials, including Bradley, expressed disappointment the Bechtel 
proposal gave a low priority to the Palmdale spur, which they view as the key 
to expanded use of Palmdale Airport. 
At speeds up to 280 m.p.h., the Las Vegas-Anaheim trip would take little more 
than an hour, Bechtel officials say. 
Bechtel envisions using magnetic-levitation technology now being tested on a 
20-mile track in West Germany. That technology, however, has not entered 
commercial service. 
Magnetic-levitation systems use a magnetic field to propel trains forward and 
to elevate them one to four inches above an elevated guideway. 
Bechtel officials say a magnetic-levitation train at 250 m.p.h. generates less 
noise than a single automobile at freeway speed. 
Perini's Cygan said his firm and partners Daniel, Mann, Johnson &amp; 
Mendenhall have not decided whether to use German or Japanese 
magnetic-levitation technology, but that they "have pretty much ruled out 
monorail, light-rail and heavy rail. Those just don't have the speed or 
environmental benefits of mag-lev."
