TIME FOR A WHALE OF AN OUTING; 
EXCURSIONS: THROUGH MID-APRIL, LANDLUBBERS CAN TAKE TO THE SEAS TO OBSERVE THE 
MIGRATION OF THE PACIFIC GRAY WHALE. 
If you've been bobbing around on your whale-watching boat for an hour or so 
without any success and you spot an unremarkable-looking mottled 
brown-and-white lump in the water, don't look away. It isn't debris, or kelp, 
or a rock. 
It's what you came to see. And if you're lucky, in a few minutes something 
spectacular may happen. 
It takes a certain eye to be a good whale watcher -- not necessarily to spot 
the great beasts but to know what you're seeing when one appears. After all, 
when a Pacific gray whale leaves its natural habitat and enters ours, the visit 
may last only a few seconds. 
Not that there's a lack of such behavior these days. From late December through 
mid-April each year, thousands of the gray whales, many of them pregnant, 
migrate from the Arctic Circle to the lagoons of Baja California, swimming 
10,000 to 15,000 miles to give birth in the warmer, southern waters. In the 
process, they put on a show that has fascinated Southern Californians for 
generations. 
So we take to the waves in droves, waiting to spot some of the largest mammals 
on Earth. But when we spot a Pacific gray whale, it's likely we won't see 
anything very gray. 
"They aren't gray from a distance," said Larry Fukuhara, program director at 
the Cabrillo Marine Museum in San Pedro. "The babies are gray, but the adults 
pick up barnacles and scars over the years, and when the barnacles fall off 
they turn the whale's skin white. If you see them through the water, though, 
they have a bluish color." 
The first time you're likely to spot a whale, Fukuhara said, is when it 
breathes. Rolling its back above the surface, the whale expels water through 
its blowhole, shooting the water up to 10 feet in the air with a whuffing 
sound. 
"It looks like smoke," Fukuhara said, "and they do it almost every time they 
surface." 
There is no rule of behavior governing breathing, but there is sort of a 
pattern, Fukuhara said. Generally a gray whale will breathe and disappear below 
the surface for about a minute, then repeat the process. After the third 
appearance, the whale will make a deep dive that lasts for two to eight 
minutes. As this dive begins, the whale will typically flip its tail -- its 
fluke -- into the air, a maneuver eagerly awaited by watchers with cameras. 
Whales also break the surface as part of a behavior called spyhopping, Fukuhara 
said. 
"They come out of the water (vertically), clear their eyes and come right back 
down," he said. "Nobody really knows why they do it, but it's seen very seldom, 
even less than breaching." 
Breaching, for the whale watcher, is the big prize. It occurs after the whale 
accelerates to about 30 knots under water and bursts vertically into the air, 
finally falling sideways back into the sea with a huge splash (an adult gray is 
up to 50 feet long and can weigh as much as 45 tons). 
"It takes thousands of horsepower to get them out of the water like that," 
Fukuhara said. "It may be a form of communication. Also, they have a lot of 
parasites on them and it may be a way to knock them off. Or maybe they're just 
having fun." 
Another phenomenon to look for, even if you can't see any whales -- yet: 
"footprints" left on the surface of the water. When a whale submerges, telltale 
rings of disturbed water remain for a few minutes, rather like the glassy 
patches left by the wakes of ships. 
Perhaps the most convenient way to go whale watching is aboard a commercial 
boat. But if you're going it on your own, there are laws to keep in mind. 
Because it is believed that boats motoring too close to the migrating whales 
will affect their behavior, federal law stipulates that no craft come within 
1,000 yards of a migrating whale, Fukuhara said. Also, it is illegal for a boat 
operator to cut across a whale's natural path or to attempt to separate a whale 
from a group. Too-close attention by watchers in motorboats also may affect the 
whales' underwater communication. 
What to bring? Rubber-soled shoes, warm clothes, possibly binoculars or a 
camera (fast film is recommended). 
And an eye for the particulars of the world's longest migration. 
Join an Excursion to See the Whales 
Whale-watching excursions are offered at several locations in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. Many trips are narrated by experts in the study of sea 
mammals, and reservations are usually required. Group rates are often 
available, as are "whale checks" -- free passes for another trip if no 
cetaceans (including porpoises and dolphins) are spotted. Many of these firms 
offer cruises that are not designed for whale watching, so specify the kind of 
excursion you want.
