FT  21 JAN 93 / Europarks 'became damaged goods'
INDUSTRIAL espionage allegedly ordered by Mr Gordon Layton, the former chief
executive of National Car Parks, could have cost his main business rival
millions of pounds, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Stephen Tucker, former head of Europarks, the car parking company, said
he had 'lost the future' of his business after it had became public
knowledge that KAS, a security company, had allegedly spied on Europarks for
NCP. Europarks had become 'damaged goods' when it had become known that NCP
had obtained confidential information about it.
Documents allegedly obtained by KAS for NCP would have been very valuable to
a business rival, he agreed. These included documents about potential future
sites, Europarks' financial position and plans to turn it into a public
company.
He sold his company to NCP in 1990 for Pounds 3.3m and accept-ed Pounds 1m
damages, the court heard.
Mr Layton and Mr Simon Hewitt, a former KAS employee, both deny conspiring
to defraud Europarks by dishonestly acquiring information relating to its
business affairs between January 1987 and November 1989. The trial continues
today.
