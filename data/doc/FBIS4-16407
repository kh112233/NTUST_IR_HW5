  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 15, BNS -- There is nothing to protect 
with measures for domestic market protection, since the level of 
development of Estonia's industrial sector is still too low, 
said Peeter Tohver, deputy chancellor for industry at the 
Ministry of Economics. 
  An open, painful economic policy helps to make clear with 
the 
help of competition, which companies are able to survive, but it 
naturally has a negative effect on the farm industry, he said. 
  Tohver, speaking at a meeting of the Estonian Union of 
Scientists Thursday [14 April], drew parallels with the 
situation of the first years of the 1918-40 Republic of Estonia, 
when a similar lack of capital and structural crisis hindered 
economic development. 
  Industrial sector accounted for 33 percent of Estonia's GDP 
in 1993, and no major changes are likely to happen this year, he 
said. He added that the share of industry in the GDP of Finland 
and Sweden, for example, was about one-fourth. 
  Industrial output in the country dropped 27 percent in 
comparable prices last year when compared with the year before. 
The decline was as big as 30 percent in state and 
municipally-owned businesses. 
  Also the uptrend in industrial output recorded at the end of 
last year again turned to a modest decline in the first months 
of 1994. The output level at the end of March equalled that of 
last year's late summer. 
  A big decline -- from 250,000 in 1985 to 175,000 in 1993 -- 
has taken place in the number of people occupied in the 
industrial sector. About 10,000, or 6 percent of the total 
work force in industry, were employed by private companies in 
the sector last year. But they gave 26.5 percent of the total 
output. 
  Only the farm industry increased its share in the country's 
total industrial output. Energy sector kept its positions, 
whereas all others showed decline.
