FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: VW steps up Mexico output by 60%
VOLKSWAGEN of Germany, the leading European car maker, is increasing its
production capacity in Mexico by more than 60 per cent. Mr Carl Hahn,
chairman of the VW management board, said that the capacity of the group's
Mexican subsidiary would be increased to 390,000 from 240,000 cars a year by
1994.
VW is making Mexico its sole production source for the supply of its Golf
range of small family cars to the north American market. Mr Hahn said the
group was seeking to make the supply of Golf cars to the US independent of
exchange rate fluctuations between the D-Mark and the US dollar.
In the first two months of the year the VW group increased its sales of
Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT and Skoda vehicles by 6 per cent to 558,000, said Mr
Hahn. Vehicle sales in Europe also rose by 6 per cent to 413,000. New orders
for VW and Audi cars were at a record level at the end of February, he said.
VW is developing its distribution co-operation with Toyota in Japan, where
47 Toyota dealers have recently agreed to begin selling VW and Audi cars in
Japan.
