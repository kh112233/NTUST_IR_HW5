  [Text] Prague -- Gen. J. Nekvasil, chief of the Czech Army 
General Staff, has informed a RUDE PRAVO reporter that, by the 
end of January, the Czech Army had already destroyed 606 tanks, 
583 armored vehicles, 621 artillery systems, and 28 combat 
aircraft. He said that the army is destroying this surplus 
hardware on the basis of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces 
in Europe. He added that owing to the reorganization of the 
units, the army will have to transfer 177,500 tonnes of 
equipment this year using roughly 7,780 railroad freightcars.
