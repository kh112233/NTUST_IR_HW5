  [Text] Nalchik June 15 TASS -- A system protecting shelters 
and homes against radioactive fallout has been invented and 
tested at a special testing range by Kuzer Varukov, a scientist 
working at the university in Nalchik, the capital of 
Kabardino-Balkaria (Russian autonomy). 
  A republican commission concluded that "the inventor proved 
in practice the possibility of making apartments and industrial 
premises impervious to radiation and providing effective 
collective protection to urban and rural residents at a lower 
cost." 
  The invention can be used in the clear-up operations after 
accidents at nuclear power plants and other enterprises which 
deal with radioactive and toxic substances. It has been found 
effective by specialists of the Russian nuclear power ministry. 
In their opinion, it allows to localize emission of harmful 
radiation and substances for the duration of work aimed at 
preventing discharge of nuclides in the environment.
