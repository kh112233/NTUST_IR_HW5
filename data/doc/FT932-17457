FT  01 APR 93 / Eight held after S Korean crash
MANAGERS from two South Korean construction companies were arrested
yesterday after they were accused of causing the nation's worst rail
accident, which killed 78 persons on Sunday.
An express train crashed on the outskirts of Pusan, South Korea's second
largest city, as nearby underground tunnelling work allegedly caused the
rail bed to collapse.
The tunnelling activity was connected with electric cable laying for Korean
Electric Power (Kepco), the state-run electricity monopoly.
Kepco had awarded the project to Samsung Construction but the tunnelling
contract was subcontracted out to Pusan-based Hanjin Construction Industry,
which is not affiliated with the Hanjin business group, the country's sixth
biggest conglomerate.
Blasting, including one explosion five minutes before the accident, is
believed to have weaken the railroad bed, which lies on a sandy strata.
The eight persons arrested by Pusan city prosecutors include the Samsung
supervisor of the construction site and executives from Hanjin.
Prosecutors are also investigating Kepco and the state-run Korean National
Railroad for possible negligence.
