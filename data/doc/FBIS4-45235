  [Text] Magdeburg -- The new justice and interior ministers 
of the new laender want to closely cooperate to a greater extent 
than before in the combating of extremist violence from the 
right and the left, as well as organized and cross-border crime. 
A ministers conference in Magdeburg resolved on Wednesday [25 
May] to counteract above all extreme-right violence by an 
increased exchange of information and experiences. New 
strategies to combat small extremist groups are to be jointly 
developed and evaluated. The exchange of preventive concepts is 
to provide better protection of foreigners' accommodations and 
asylum-seekers' homes. 
  The Magdeburg decision further says: The ministers "state 
their firm intention to deepen their cooperation in the 
prevention and prosecution of violent extremist criminals and 
violent criminal acts and to fully support each other mutually, 
particularly in the prevention of prepared actions or marches of 
extremist organizations." 
  Regarding cross-border crime, the conference called on the 
FRG Government to specify and supplement the existing and 
planned treaties with Poland and the Czech Republic. Direct 
political cooperation at the border and mutual legal assistance 
have to be facilitated and all official processes to be 
shortened. 
  Because of first signs of organized crime in the new laender 
alone, the ministers think that it is necessary "to take 
consistent action with joint strategies involving more than one 
land." In general, information and experiences also have to be 
intensively exchanged here. The public prosecutor's offices 
should be consulted in joint official meetings of police and 
customs authorities. 
  The ministers expressed concern about the different 
conclusions from the "hashish ruling" of the Federal 
Constitutional Court in the old laender. A liberalization of 
the narcotics law must be prevented as far as possible. In the 
assessment of the possession of small amounts of the drug, each 
individual case has to be examined by all means, it was stated. 
On no account must one refrain from punishment if drugs are 
consumed in schools, recreational facilities for young people, 
barracks, or other facilities where young people and children 
stay. The possession of hard drugs has to be prosecuted in any 
case. The point is to "ensure that the scourge of drugs is 
averted from the new laender," Saxony-Anhalt Interior and 
Justice Minister Walter Remmers (Christian Democratic Union) 
said.
