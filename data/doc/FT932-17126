FT  02 APR 93 / Opt-out schools rapped for finance weaknesses
WEAKNESSES IN financial controls are causing difficulties for the
grant-maintained schools which opt out of local education authority control,
says a report published today by the National Audit Office.
The public expenditure watchdog said the opt-out schools needed to tighten
their internal controls, financial reporting, control of assets and
purchasing procedures.
Most have made efforts to improve financial controls, the report says, with
weaknesses identified immediately after opting-out progressively remedied
within the first two years.
However, pressure of time and inexperience in financial matters meant that
the schools had not implemented features of good practice recommended by
their auditors.
The NAO recommends that the Department for Education should be more active
in following up school auditors' reports on shortcomings.
Some of the schools visited by the NAO had failed to segregate key financial
duties such as custody and recording of cash. Most of the computerised
accounting systems inspected lacked important requirements of financial
control, such as double-entry book-keeping.
Few of the schools visited fully costed their business plans. The
government's leading curriculum adviser yesterday recommended a review of
the national school tests which are threatened with boycotts by teaching
unions.
Mr David Pascall, chairman of the National Curriculum Council, told a
conference in Oxford that the national curriculum taught in primary schools
was overloaded.
