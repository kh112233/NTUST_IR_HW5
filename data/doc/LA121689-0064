MAN, 30, IS INJURED AFTER CAR COLLIDES WITH TROLLEY 
A 30-year-old San Diego man was injured Friday night when a southbound San 
Diego Trolley collided with his eastbound car at 12th Avenue and E Street. 
Mac Barba was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center with unknown injuries after 
the 8:10 p.m. accident, police said. 
Within 15 minutes of the accident, passengers on the trolley, which was halted 
when Barba's wrecked 1988 Camaro became partially pinned under the front car, 
were transferred to another light-rail train. A trolley dispatcher declined to 
say how many passengers were aboard at the time of the accident, but police 
said that none was injured. 
A witness and a police officer said that Barba was crossing the intersection 
when the trolley hit him broadside and pushed him about 10 feet down the 
tracks.
