  [Text] Istanbul (A.A) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has 
said that he is disturbed by the unfounded reports concerning 
the state that have been concocted by journalists. 
  Cetin who returned to Ankara after taking part in a private 
television station show in Istanbul, replied to reporters' 
questions at Istanbul Ataturk Airport. 
  Replying to a question on a news report that appeared in one 
of the dailies today under the headline "We Should Go to War," 
Cetin said that he made no such statement. He added: "I was 
shocked when I read the report: `The extension of Greece's 
territorial waters to 12 nautical miles is a reason for war. We 
should go to war with Greece.'" 
  Cetin stressed that when writing such reports, journalists 
should consider the possible consequences. He added: "Certain 
journalists sit at their desks and concoct news reports. This 
issue concerns the state. We will get into trouble because of 
such unfounded reports." 
  Commenting on the fact that Turkey and Russia sent each 
other 
notes in connection with the Montreux Treaty on the straits, 
Cetin said: "The efforts to reorganize the treaty are in line 
with international law. That is what we pointed out in the note 
we sent to the Russian Federation. The answer we receive to our 
note will shape the developments between the two states in 
connection with this matter."
