FT  03 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Illegal software merchants hit
US PERSONAL computer software companies have launched a world-wide effort to
crack down on software pirates operating electronic bulletin board systems
which they allege are illegally distributing copies of their software
programs.
Police in Berlin recently raided the premises of 13 bulletin board
operations after an investigation by the Business Software Alliance, a group
representing US software companies.
According to BSA, Berlin police seized about 25 computers containing illegal
copies of software programs.
Electronic bulletin boards (BBs) consist of a computer that can be accessed
by other personal computers via telephone lines. PC users can dial these
services and obtain copies of programs or send messages. For the most part
this is a legitimate cottage industry run by computer enthusiasts. Some,
however, offer cheap copies of popular software programs.
'Distributors of illegal software are now operating aggressively throughout
the world, selling pirated copies of software to unsuspecting consumers,'
said Mr Robert Holleyman, BSA president. Software piracy cost the industry
an estimated Dollars 10bn to Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn) in lost sales last
year, according to BSA.
BBs distribution is one of several methods of 'cross-border' piracy which
have become a primary focus of anti-piracy efforts by the software industry
group.
Others are the illegal copying of software within multi-national companies
and the establishment of software distributors formed specifically to move
counterfeit products from country to country.
