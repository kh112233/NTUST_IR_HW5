  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP April 25 -- Prince Norodom Sirivut, 
vice-prime minister and minister for foreign affairs and 
international cooperation, has recently received here Mr. Jean 
Michel Monod, president of International Committee of Red Cross 
(ICRC), in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs. 
  During talks, Jean Michel asked Prince Sirivut for access 
for 
the ICRC to all border-posts, thus facilitating the latter in 
distributing humanitarian aid. 
  The ICRC president also asked for a permission to meet the 
ex-Khmer Rouge soldiers who deserted to or were captured by 
Cambodian Royal Armed Forces. 
  He wished a Cambodian representative to attend the meeting 
on 
mines problem to be held in Geneva in the future. 
  For his part, Prince Norodom Sirivut thanked ICRC for having 
helped Cambodians victimised from mines and accidents. 
  With regard to the ICRC's proposal, the prince outlined that 
the Royal Government was thinking about the possibility for 
giving access to the border-posts, including Poipet, but the 
access would not be authorized internationally as that of 
Pochentong Airport.
