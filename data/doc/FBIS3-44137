  [Text] Freetown, 25 Jan (AFP) -- Rebel forces have killed 
about 100 civilians and razed several villages to the ground in 
attacks on the Bo region since the beginning of the month, 
military sources said here Monday. Villagers have fled the 
region in Sierra Leone in panic after rebels from the 
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) attacked eight towns in the 
past three weeks. 
  Eyewitnesses told AFP here that some of the rebels boys aged 
10 to 17 but were heavily armed and had no hesitation in 
torturing victims. Government forces a year ago re-captured the 
eight villages, located 170 kilometres (105 miles) east of the 
capital Freetown, and have maintained overall their control in 
the area despite the recent attacks, the military sources 
reported.
