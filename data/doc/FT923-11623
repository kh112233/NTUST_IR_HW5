FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Bristol-Myers plans larger-scale
trials of new Aids drug
THE international Aids conference brought encouraging news for some
pharmaceutical companies yesterday.
Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US was happy with the early clinical tests of
its candidate Aids drug d4T and said it planned larger-scale trials.
And its existing drug DDI, which had not performed as well on its own as
Wellcome's AZT, proved more successful in combination with AZT.
Other new Aids drugs which have recently started clinical trials - and are
giving results promising enough for the companies to continue development -
are Glaxo's 3TC, American Cyanamid's FLT and Upjohn's U-87,201E.
But the conference heard that several other development drugs, notably
Merck's L661, have been dropped because HIV, the virus that causes Aids,
becomes resistant to them rapidly.
Most drugs are continuing clinical development work in the same way as AZT.
They mimic thymine, one of the building blocks of genetic material; when HIV
incorporates a drug molecule into its growing genetic chain, it jams the
mechanism by which the virus replicates. In common with AZT, the new drugs
cannot eliminate HIV but they do slow the collapse of the immune system
which causes Aids. And, like AZT, some have shown side-effects, though the
companies hope these will not matter in practice once they have established
the right dosage.
At present d4T is ahead of the others in its development programme, with 3TC
not far behind. Although the clinical data are too limited to make a fair
comparison, it seems from yesterday's evidence that 3TC may have fewer
side-effects, but d4T may be a more potent anti-viral drug.
FLT is 10 times more potent than AZT, according to laboratory tests but it
has shown anaemia as an unexpected side-effect, forcing American Cyanamid to
repeat the first phase of clinical trials with lower doses. And U-87,201E
has caused some liver poisoning as a side-effect.
