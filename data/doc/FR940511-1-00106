Seasonal Closure of the O'Malley River Area in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule.

 

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to limit public access, occupancy and use of a portion of the O'Malley
River drainage and adjacent lands bordering Karluk Lake and O'Malley Lake within the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge
(Refuge). Public use of a parcel of land and water consisting of approximately 3,955 acres will be restricted from
June 25 through September 30 annually to individuals participating in a refuge-sponsored bear viewing program.



This seasonal closure is necessary to prevent incompatible conflicts between people and brown bears at an important
bear concentration area, during the season when conflicts and impacts on bears are most prevalent. It is intended
to control increasing human use of a very important bear concentration area so that human uses in the area remain compatible
with refuge purposes. Research and experience have clearly demonstrated that control of human activity in major
bear concentration areas is necessary to avoid conflicts between people and bears. Organized bear viewing programs
elsewhere in Alaska have proven highly successful in reducing conflict to an acceptable level while maintaining
quality public use opportunities. This action will allow quality public viewing and photography opportunities
through the O'Malley Bear Viewing Program without adversely affecting bear use of this important feeding area. 
An interim rule that would provide a restriction on public access from June 25, 1994, to September 30, 1994, is being
published elsewhere in this separate part of the 

Federal Register

 with this proposed rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Background 


President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge by Executive Order 8857 on August
14, 1941, to ``preserve the natural feeding and breeding ground of the brown bear and other wildlife.'' This action
withdrew about 1.9 million acres from unreserved public domain on Kodiak and Uganik Islands. Congress redesignated
the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge in 1980 when it enacted the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA).
All the lands, water, interests, and submerged lands retained in federal ownership at the time of statehood were included
in the refuge. This legislation also added about 50,000 acres of public lands on Afognak and Ban Islands to Kodiak National
Wildlife Refuge. Section 303 (5) (b) of ANILCA states generally that ``[t]he purposes for which Kodiak National Wildlife
Refuge is established and shall be managed include (i) to conserve fish and wildlife populations and habitats in their
natural diversity including, but not limited to, Kodiak brown bears, salmonoids, sea otters, sea lions, and other
marine mammals and migratory birds; (ii) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States with
respect to fish and wildlife and their habitats; 
(iii) to provide, in a manner consistent with purposes set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), the opportunity for
continued subsistence use by local residents; and (iv) to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable and in a manner
consistent with the purposes set forth in subparagraph (i), water quality and necessary water quantity within the
refuge.
The Kodiak Refuge Comprehensive Conservation Plan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1987) provides primary guidance
for management of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. According to its approved alternative, ``the Service will
undertake detailed management planning to guide implementation of the plan and operation of the refuge.'' In support
of that mandate, utilizing a full spectrum of public involvement, the final draft of the Kodiak Refuge Public Use Management
Plan has been written. This proposed rule and the interim rule which is being published elsewhere in this separate
part of the 

Federal Register

 are a result of direction provided by both these planning processes. 
During 199091 the Service tested a trial bear viewing program, staffed by Refuge personnel, at the Dog Salmon
Creek Fish Pass on Kodiak Refuge. No closure was utilized for unguided use, but guided use was restricted through the
special use permit process. This trial bear viewing program was successful except that the presence of artificial
fish passage structures significantly impaired the quality of viewing opportunities available to the public.
