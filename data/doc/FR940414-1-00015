SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening to May 4, 1994, the comment period on the notice of proposed rulemaking

(OTC) antacid drug products containing sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient (February 2, 1994, 59 FR 5060).
FDA is taking this action in response to a request to extend the comment period for an additional 30 days to allow more
time to comment on this proposal. The comment period for these issues closed on April 4, 1994. This proposal is part
of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

 In the 

Federal Register

 of February 2, 1994 (59 FR 5060), FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the final monograph for OTC antacid
drug products to require specific indication, warning, and direction statements in the labeling of products containing
sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient (hereinafter referred to as the February 1994, proposal). The new labeling
would be required only for oral dosage forms intended to be dissolved in liquid prior to administration, such as powders
and effervescent granules or tablets. As proposed, no such oral dosage forms containing sodium bicarbonate as an
active ingredient would be allowed to make a claim for ``relief of overindulgence in food and drink.'' The proposed
warnings would alert consumers to avoid antacid drug products containing sodium bicarbonate when the stomach is
overly full from eating and drinking. The proposed directions would inform consumers that sodium bicarbonate should
be completely dissolved before drinking and that the recommended dose should not be exceeded. FDA issued the February
1994, proposal after receiving reports of gastric (stomach) rupture following ingestion of sodium bicarbonate
to relieve gastrointestinal distress. Interested persons were given until April 4, 1994, to submit comments on the
proposal.


On March 28, 1994, the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA), a trade association representing
the manufacturers and distributors of OTC medicines, requested that the comment period be extended for at least 30
days. NDMA stated that the extension is necessary to provide sufficient time to develop comprehensive comments to
submit to the agency. NDMA explained that most companies that distribute OTC drug products containing sodium bicarbonate
as an active ingredient were not anticipating changes in the antacid final monograph and the February 1994, proposal
provided the first opportunity for many affected parties to become aware of the agency's concerns and intentions
for amending the monograph. NDMA stated that interested parties have had insufficient time to acquire the reference
materials cited by FDA, to retrieve relevant product experience reports, and to research thoroughly the issues raised
in FDA's February 1994, proposal. NDMA also mentioned that the time period for the comments includes several days
on which many company employees will not be working because of religious holidays.
FDA has carefully considered the request and believes that this additional time for comment is in the public interest.
Accordingly, the comment period is reopened to May 4, 1994.
Interested persons may, on or before May 4, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding OTC antacid drug products containing sodium bicarbonate as an active ingredient. Three copies
of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with
the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
