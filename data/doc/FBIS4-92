  [Text] Sao Tome, 30 Mar (AFP) -- Reliable sources in Sao 
Tome disclosed today that the country runs the risk of having 
its structural adjustment loans suspended because the government 
is not prepared to bear the social consequences of the World 
Bank's "drastic measures." 
  In a faxed message sent to Finance Minister Arlindo Carvalho 
and Central Bank Governor Adelino Castelo David, the World Bank 
said the country runs the risk of having the payment of new 
loans suspended because it has not met the bank's conditions. A 
copy of this message was also sent to AFP. 
  The suspension of World Bank loans could have repercussions 
on the progress of the structural adjustment program agreed upon 
by Sao Tome and the IMF. 
  The World Bank is accusing the Sao Tome Government of not 
achieving any "tangible results" in the implementation of its 
recommendations. These recommendations basically include the 
privatization of state enterprises, the restructuring of the 
financial system, and a reduction in the civil service work 
force. The government has been asked to cut down its civil 
service work force by half by January 1995. This means laying 
off nearly 2,000 workers. An emergency cabinet meeting was 
convened following the World Bank warning.
