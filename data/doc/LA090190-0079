NAVAL PATROL BOAT SUNK IN LATEST BOMBING IN SPAIN 
A bomb sank a Spanish naval patrol boat anchored in San Sebastian harbor Friday 
in the second bombing incident in the city in less than 24 hours. 
Police said no one was injured in the blast on the 30-foot boat, which had been 
evacuated after Red Cross officials received an anonymous early morning warning 
by telephone. 
Explosives experts rushed to the scene, but the bomb went off before they 
arrived. Police did not know the size of the bomb. 
Police Thursday defused a powerful parcel bomb sent to the head of the Civil 
Guard in Spain's northern province of Guipuzcoa. 
They said the bomb, containing 2.4 pounds of explosives, was hidden among 
geography books sent to Lt. Col. Enrique Rodriguez Galindo from Madrid. 
No one claimed responsibility for either of the bombs, which follow a wave of 
letter and parcel bomb attacks on judicial and government officials this year 
by ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) separatists.
