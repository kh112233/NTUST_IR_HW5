<F P=106> ["S. Korea; Hangmen's Brutalities on Unconverted Long-term </F>
Prisoners" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- Many long-term prisoners 
including some 40 unconverted prisoners are now kept in Taejon, 
Taegu, Kwangju and other South Korean prisons. 
  Most of them are old men in their sixties, some above 80, 
kept in prison for more than 20 years in general and even 43 
years. 
  Fascist hangmen labelled those who refused to recant their 
belief as "political offenders" and have committed all sorts of 
inhumanitarian brutalities against them for scores of years, 
putting 9 to 10 prisoners in a 0.8 square metre room and even 
confining them separately in double-walled special solitary 
cells. 
  The hangmen not allowing some unconverted long-term 
prisoners 
to take exercise, meet with outsiders and receive medical 
treatment, some prisoner died to their chagrin behind bars 
without tasting a bit of medicine. 
  The fascist hangmen have made no scruples of making cripples 
of long-term prisoners or murdering them through brutal tortures. 
  Due to their inhumane tortures, Kim Yong-song was murdered, 
Son Mun-kyu killed on the spot and many other long-term 
prisoners were deprived of their lives and crippled physically. 
  It is not accidental that Kwon Nak-ki, chairman of the 
council of families of long-term prisoners under the council of 
the family movement for realizing democracy, wrote in an article 
titled "Personal History of Unconverted Long-term Prisoners Who 
Died in Prison" that many long-term prisoners lost their lives 
in prison. Their deaths were frequently dismissed as deaths from 
disease or suicide but, actually, they were murders by the 
violence of dictatorial regimes". 
  History will never pardon the South Korean fascist hangmen's 
inhumanitarian brutalities against the long-term prisoners who 
are fighting unyieldingly in defence of their faith and 
conscience.
