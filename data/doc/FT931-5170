FT  08 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Harnessing the wind at
Kirkby-in-Furness
A Pounds 5m contract to install 12 400kW wind turbines at the new Kirkby
Moor wind farm in Cumbria has been won by TAYLOR WOODROW CONSTRUCTION
NORTHERN.
With a total capacity of 4.8MW, the wind farm at Kirkby-in-Furness will
supply electricity for the equivalent of 4,500 homes.
The wind farm project, a joint venture between National Power, South Wales
Electricity and Taylor Woodrow Construction Holdings, removes the need to
emit 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year in burning fossil fuels.
The turnkey construction contract for the Kirkby Moor wind farm company
includes civil works and installation of electrical equipment.
