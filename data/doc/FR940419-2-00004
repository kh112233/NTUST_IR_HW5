SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The inventions available for licensing are:


NIST Docket No. 89031




Title:

 Highly Accurate In-Situ Determination of Refractivity of an Ambient Atmosphere


Description:

 A method of determining the index of refraction of an ambient atmosphere, such as air. This measurement can then be
used to enhance the accuracy of a quantity measurement (such as measurement of distance or length), for example, during
the ``step and repeat'' process of patterning integrated circuit wafers using photolithography.


NIST Docket No. 91002




Title:

 Thermal Properties Measurement Using a Superconductor Sensor


Description:

 Superconducting materials are used to sense the thermal environment in low power cryogenic flow meters, bolometers,
level detectors, etc. This invention uses derivative functions of the voltage/current relationship, or any other
parameter indicative of the non-linearity of this relationship, to control the current in these devices via a feedback
loop.


NIST Docket No. 91010




Title:

 Corrosion Resistant Thin-Film Thermocouples and Method 


Description:

 These thin-film thermocouples provide fast temperature measurements and can operate in highly corrosive environments.
The response speed of these devices approach 1,000 times faster than commercially available sheathed sensors. They
can be miniaturized for use in harsh environments.


NIST Docket No. 91013




Title:

 Method and Apparatus for Analyzing Character Strings


Description:

 Newly developed NIST technology analyzes and corrects errors in electronically stored character strings derived
from handwritten documents. A processor has been designed to incorporate the technology, which significantly improves
optical character recognition of handwritten data.


NIST Docket No. 92044




Title:

 Monitor for Gas-Metal-Arc Welding (GMAW) Process


Description:

 New NIST technology provides improved control of gas-metal-arc welding (GMAW) and reduces material flaws caused
by process perturbations. The technique relates arc light intensity to arc length, which corresponds with arc voltage,
indicating metal-transfer frequency.


NIST Docket No. 93016




Title:

 High Intermetallic Titanium-Aluminum-Vanadium-Chromium Alloys Combining High Temperature Strength with Excellent
Room Temperature Ductility


Description:

 New NIST alloys are about 50 percent lighter than other alloys used in aerospace and industrial applications. They
are very ductile at room temperatures and provide excellent strength at high temperatures.


NIST Docket No. 93017




Title:

 Correlated Run Length Method for Detecting Form Structure within Digitized Documents


Description:

 A method of analyzing digitized form documents to identify lines, boxes and other shapes on the documents; this information
allows a scanning system to identify the form being scanned and the data entry fields on that form.


NIST Docket No. 31038




Title:

 Amperometric Flow Injection Analysis Biosensor for Glucose Based on Graphite Paste Modified with Tetracyanoquinodimethane


Description:

 NIST has developed a new biosensor for glucose based on using a graphite paste of glucose oxidase and tetracyanoquinodimethan
(TCNQ) in a flow injection analysis system.
