Agency -- A professor from a Libyan university, in co-operation 
with the centre for nuclear research in Tajoura has reached a 
breakthrough in his experiments in nuclear fusion, the energy 
which is created from a nuclear reaction between two nuclei, 
with identical characteristics, such as hydrogen rays, when they 
are fused. This type of reaction is the opposite of what takes 
place in nuclear fission which is currently carried out by 
atomic reactors throughout the world and are used to produce 
nuclear energy and to conduct nuclear tests. 
  The research scientist says that the results of his theory 
is 
the solution to the problem of beginning research in this area 
at an international level, where research continues and there is 
still no emergence of a reactor which would use hydrogen as it 
[word indistinct]. Hydrogen is one of the main elements of 
water and thus energy created from nuclear fusion is considered 
to be one of the most important alternative forms of energy in 
the future because its fuel (water) is available in (?great 
quantities) from the sea and oceans. 
  The research scientist says that this discovery will spur 
scientisist to review their research and experiments and to 
reexamine their theoretical studies and reformulate them on new 
bases and concepts. 
  The research scientist said that this discovery would help 
to 
solve other scientific problems which depended on it.
