MANDELA DEFENDS HIS WIFE'S ACTIONS 
South African black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela defended his wife, 
Winnie, against allegations of possible involvement in the kidnaping and 
killing of a 14-year-old black activist. 
Speaking in Lagos, Nigeria, Mandela said his wife had been the victim of the 
"most scandalous persecution" by the Pretoria government. Three men have 
testified that they were abducted in December, 1988, with the teen-ager and 
taken to Winnie Mandela's Soweto house. They said she beat them and permitted 
her bodyguards to assault them.
