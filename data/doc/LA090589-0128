THE SIDELINES; 
U.S. RESTS IN GIOIOSA DRUG, TAX CASE 
Federal prosecutors rested their case today in the drug and tax-evasion trial 
of former Pete Rose house-mate Thomas Gioiosa after calling two more witnesses 
who did business with Gioiosa. 
The government presented seven witnesses during the seven-day trial who 
implicated Gioiosa and Rose in a scheme to defraud the Internal Revenue Service 
by having Gioiosa claim Rose's race track winnings. 
Gioiosa, 31, also is accused of participation in a cocaine smuggling ring 
directed by the former operators of a gymnasium where Gioiosa was employed and 
Rose worked out.
