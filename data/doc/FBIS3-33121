<F P=106> [Letter issued by the National Directorate of the Sandinist </F>
National Liberation Front in Managua on 14 February] 
  [Text] The Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN], in 
light of the threat from U.S. authorities to expel Nicaraguan 
citizens currently living in the United States, firmly backs the 
defense of the legal permanence of these Nicaraguan countrymen 
in U.S. territory. 
  The FSLN believes that one reason for the migration of 
Nicaraguan citizens to the United States was the war of 
aggression financed, directed, and organized by the U.S. 
Government against the Sandinist Government. 
<H5>  Exodus Promoted </H5>
  The U.S. Government in those days encouraged an exodus of 
skilled Nicaraguans to the United States. The effect of that 
policy was to subject a large number of Nicaraguans to a 
vulnerable migratory condition. 
  Our countrymen, seduced by offers of well being and 
democracy 
in the United States, pay their taxes and contribute to the 
economy with their work, whether they are aware of it or not. 
However, their legal vulnerability makes them second-class 
citizens, subjects them to low wages, and leaves them without 
the social protection afforded other immigrants who, for 
different reasons, emigrate to that country. 
<H5>  Object of Propaganda </H5>
  We believe it is totally unfair that citizens who have lived 
in the United States for many years, after being used as 
propaganda and cheap labor, are being pressured to leave that 
country. Furthermore, by virtue of their years of residency, our 
countrymen are protected by the rights they have acquired in 
accordance with U.S. laws. 
  The most conservative forces in U.S. society and "the 
establishment" [previous word in English] bolster xenophobic 
measures against Nicaraguan immigrants, thus universalizing the 
phenomenon observed in other parts of the world. Such actions 
must be rejected by the Clinton administration, which has the 
human rights doctrine as its main political banner. 
  Our Nicaragua of today is going through one of the worst 
moments of its economic crisis. The high unemployment rate and 
the stringent pressure from the international financial agencies 
(IMF-World Bank) preclude any thought of a possible economic 
reactivation that may bring hopes of progress and work for our 
countrymen. 
  The FSLN calls on the National Assembly and all the 
country's 
political and social forces to support our fellow countrymen. 
  The FSLN demands that the Nicaraguan Government defend the 
rights of these Nicaraguans, who are threatened with imminent 
deportation that implies familial and social instability. 
  The FSLN believes that the Clinton administration has an 
opportunity to exercise its human rights policy and to remain 
separate from the more conservative forces of his country that 
encourage xenophobic feelings.
