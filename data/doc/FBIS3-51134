  [Text] Havana, 4 Jan (PL) -- Cuban tourism, the only sector 
to achieve a sustained annual growth in excess of 25 percent 
during the 1990's, is currently expected to play a leading role 
in helping to reverse the economic crisis in which the island 
finds itself. 
  If estimates prepared less than two years ago are fulfilled, 
Cuba will receive approximately 800,000 tourists in the next 12 
months. The figure represents a precursor to the great goal for 
1995 -- to welcome 1 million vacationers and surpass the 
$1-billion mark in gross revenues. 
  Unofficial estimates indicate that Cuba last year provided 
accommodations for approximately 600,000 foreign visitors and 
reached approximately $700 million in gross revenues, which 
represented an increase of between 26 and 28 percent compared 
with the previous year. 
  Cuba welcomed 340,000 summer visitors early in the 1990's. 
The number rose to 424,000 in 1991 and it surpassed the 
488,000-mark in 1992, according to statements made by Rafael Sed 
Perez, president of the National Institute of Tourism (Intur). 
  The tourism industry was mentioned barely three days ago by 
Cuban President Fidel Castro as one of the activities that would 
indicate -- with its results in 1994 -- the country's economic 
situation was showing signs of improvement. 
  The boom in this sector coincided, perhaps paradoxically, 
with the loss of the island's import capability, which was 
reduced from $8.139 billion in 1991 to $1.179 billion last year, 
when the sugar harvest -- approximately 4.28 million tons -- 
suffered an estimated loss of $450 million. 
  The Cuban authorities' confidence in a more efficient 
tourism 
industry is based, among other thingss, on foreign investors' 
increasing interest to establish their presence in that sector. 
  Nearly 10 European and American hotel chains have contracts 
for the management and marketing of hotel facilities, basically 
in the beach resort of Varadero, eastern Santiago de Cuba 
Province; Cayo Coco (in the country's central area); and in the 
capital. 
  These chains include Spain's Sol-Melia, Guitart Hotels, 
Kawama Caribbean Hotels, Iberostar, Raytur Caribe, and RIU; 
Germany's LTI; Jamaica's Superclubs; and Canada's Delta. 
  The latter officially inaugurated on Sunday the picturesque 
Delta-Sierra Mar Hotel, built on a ridge of the most important 
mountain range on the island, the Sierra Maestra, on the 
Caribbean sea. 
  The Cuban tourism sector's lodging capabilities for the 
remainder of 1994 should be approximately 25,000 rooms (it 
currently exploits about 20,000), a figure that barely 
represents 12 percent of the archipelago's potential -- an 
estimated 200,000 rooms. 
  The Seagull, Inc. tourism group alone plans to open two 
hotels early this year: The Coral, in Varadero, and the Rio de 
Mares, in northeastern Holguin Province. 
  Other elements that favor the development of this industry 
are an increase in the number of foreign airlines (29) which 
land at nine tourism centers in over 90 weekly flights, as well 
as the momentum gathered by the so-called cruise tourism in 1993. 
  Referring to the latter, there are great expectations 
concerning the advantages of opening a maritime navigation line 
between Havana and Jamaican and Mexican ports. This would, in 
turn, favor the development of multiple destination operations. 
  The cruise ship "Santiago de Cuba" is operated by the 
Havanatur, Inc., Acemex [not further identified], and Fratelli 
Consulich firms; and its launching, last December, had a great 
impact at the international level because it features a casino 
that only begins to operate when the ship is more than 12 
nautical miles from the Cuban coast.
