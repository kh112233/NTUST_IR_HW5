FT  27 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Economists cannot price environment
Sir, Your leader writer's recommendation that the environment should have a
price tag on it in the same way that other goods have, and that
environmental policy should be based on such a price, is highly questionable
('Valuing the environment', August 19).
At the same time it sets the very same trap that Prof Lawrence Summers, the
World Bank's chief economist, walked into with his infamous leaked World
Bank memo last year (see 'Save planet earth from economists', February 10
1992). Prices do nothing but reflect both people's (marginal) willingness to
pay and their ability to pay.
However, as ability to pay obviously depends on income, willingness to pay
depends on the prevailing income distribution.
To place environmental policy on such a footing provides a perfect
justification for, say, South America to cut down its rainforests and Europe
to export its waste and, thus, pollution, to Africa. It is perfectly
efficient, isn't it?
If that is what economics is actually about, then economists had better
renounce their claim to being responsible policy advisers.
I doubt whether you are really serious about these implications.
