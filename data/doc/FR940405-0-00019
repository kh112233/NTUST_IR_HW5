 

In addition, this rule changes the minimum size requirements for several varieties of nectarines packed in loose-filled
and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for nectarines specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3)(ii),
(a)(4)(ii), (a)(5)(ii), (a)(7)(ii), and (a)(8)(ii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes
made in column 2 of both Table 1 for early-season and mid-season nectarine varieties, and Table 2 for late-season nectarine
varieties cited in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of 916.350. 

The NAC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity
relationships for these nectarine varieties, and consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. This rule
is designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh nectarines consistent with expected crop and market
conditions. 



Regulatory Periods (Peaches) 



Under 917.442, California Peach Container and Pack Regulation (7 CFR 917.442), fresh California peach shipments
are regulated by container and during the period April 15 through November 23 each year. Under 917.459, California
Peach Grade and Size Regulation (7 CFR 917.459, as amended at 58 FR 32591, June 11, 1993, and 58 FR 43499, August 17, 1993),
fresh California peach shipments are also regulated by grade, maturity, and size during the period April 15 through
November 23 each year. These regulations are effective on a continuing basis subject to amendment, modification,
or suspension by the Secretary. 

This rule amends paragraph (a) in 917.442 and paragraph (a) in 917.459 to change the regulatory periods
in each of these sections to April 1 through November 23 each year, so that all peach shipments made each season are covered
by these regulatory requirements. Correspondingly, paragraph (b) of 917.459 is revised to change the beginning
date of the regulatory requirements to April 1 from April 15 each year. Handlers ship fresh peaches during the April
1April 15 period when the harvest season begins early. The PCC unanimously recommended this change. 



Container and Pack Requirements (Peaches) 



Section 917.442 currently specifies container and pack requirements for fresh peach shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of 917.442 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled
containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of peaches in a 16-pound
sample for each tray pack size designation. This rule revises paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of 917.442 by modifying
Table 1 to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season peach varieties, and adding a new Table
2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season peach varieties.
