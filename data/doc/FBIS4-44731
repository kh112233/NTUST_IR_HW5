  [Text] The European Union has awarded a significant subsidy 
to the Netherlands Gas Laboratory to examine, in cooperation 
with other European companies, the possibility of improving the 
"reformer," the essential element for the operation of fuel 
cells. The reformer enables methane to be converted into 
hydrogen. The goal would be to create a reformer which is 
smaller, more efficient, more esthetic, and cheaper, and which 
kicks off faster. 
  A number of industrial partners are interested in the 
project. The ultimate goal is that Europe would have at its 
disposal an ultramodern technique in the field of fuel cells so 
as to strenghten its competitive position in a market where the 
Japanese and Americans have made great strides. The real 
project started in December and will continue for three and a 
half years.
