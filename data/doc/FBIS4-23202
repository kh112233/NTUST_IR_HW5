<F P=106> [Interview with RPF Secretary General Theogene Rudasingwa by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "We Will 
Put an End to the Killing"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Relief organizations estimate that 
half a million people have been killed in the Rwandan civil war. 
Is the Tutsi tribe, who have been called the Jews of Central 
Africa, threatened with extinction? 
  [Rudasingwa] The genocide has almost been completed, except 
for the people who have managed to flee to neighboring 
countries. However, not only Tutsis have fallen victim to the 
massacres; the entire Hutu opposition has also been massacred. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, it was no classical tribal warfare? 
  [Rudasingwa] This is the cliche that the world likes to use 
too much: Hutus are massacring Tutsis in an outbreak of archaic 
hatred. This is so easy, because if this explanation is true, 
no one really has to feel responsible. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Who is really to blame for this blood-bath? 
  [Rudasingwa] Not the Hutus, but a dictatorial clique that 
wants to stay in power with its army, its militias, and its 
death squads. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But it is probably not a coincidence that 
these 
forces belong to the Hutu tribe. The Tutsis, on the other hand, 
were the ruling people in the past. Is this not a reckoning 
between master and servant? 
  [Rudasingwa] The fact is: Tutsis and Hutus managed to get 
along with each other for many centuries. They are linked by 
one language, one religion. Tensions began during the colonial 
era, when the Belgians used the Tutsi elite as collaborators. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Rwanda became independent in 1962. You cannot 
still blame everything on the colonial powers. 
  [Rudasingwa] Our country's politicians are far more to blame 
than the Belgians, because they were only too happy to take over 
the colonial structures -- including the passports, in which 
one's tribe is noted. The Rwandan politicians have missed the 
opportunity to build a nation. They were interested only in 
their own privileges. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Corruption and the abuse of power also exist 
in 
other countries; still, there are no such horrible excesses 
committed there. 
  [Rudasingwa] Rwanda's ruling Hutu clique shamelessly 
exploited their tribal origins to achieve their political goals. 
The current war broke out at a moment when the old regime saw 
itself threatened by a new alliance between Tutsis and Hutus, 
who formed joint opposition parties. It is a struggle between 
democratic forces and dictatorship. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Rwanda is the most densely inhabited country 
on 
the African continent. In addition, hundreds of thousands of 
Tutsis, some of whom had been driven out as early as in 1959, 
were preparing their return with the help of your liberation 
movement, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF. Are the massacres 
not also an expression of the quarrel over the scarce arable 
land, the struggle for survival? 
  [Rudasingwa] Overpopulation and scarce resources are 
certainly the main problems of our country. However, this is no 
reason to fan fear among the population and to refuse the return 
of the refugees. Rwanda's problems could be solved with a modern 
policy: We need better agriculture and a moderate form of 
industrialization. We have large nature preserves and hunting 
reserves that we should use for regulated tourism. However, the 
mountain gorillas must never be more important than the people 
in our country. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Are you disappointed that the international 
community is reacting with helplessness to the genocide in 
Rwanda? 
  [Rudasingwa] We do not believe that international 
organizations, such as the Organization of African Unity or the 
United Nations, can really help. Foreign troops have never 
managed to restore law and order in a country. After the 
debacle in Somalia, we want to accept no more than 3,000 blue 
helmets to guard relief convoys. If UN soldiers try to prevent 
us from defeating the dictatorial regime in Rwanda, we will 
shoot at them. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your RPF, which is dominated by the Tutsis, 
has 
surrounded the capital city of Kigali. You can achieve a 
military victory, but what is going to happen then? Revenge on 
the Hutus? 
  [Rudasingwa] A predecessor of the RPF was founded by Tutsis 
in exile in 1979. However, fortunately, we are no longer a 
purely Tutsi organization. We are the only force that can put 
an end to the killing, and the Hutus, too, know that; they are 
just as much victims as the Tutsis. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How does a party that is considered to be a 
Tutsi movement want to rule in a country with a Hutu majority? 
  [Rudasingwa] We are not coming as conquerors. We are ready 
to form alliances with all parties that were not involved in the 
genocide. We want to prevent mass murders from being committed 
ever again in our homeland.
