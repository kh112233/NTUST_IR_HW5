FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Shephard signals return to
traditional English teaching
The new curriculum for English announced by Mrs Gillian Shephard in her
conference speech will require teachers to take a much more traditionalist
approach in the classroom than they do now, emphasising grammar, spelling
and punctuation.
However, it is a far less radical shift from the current orthodoxy than a
proposal prepared by curriculum advisers for Mr John Patten, former
secretary of state for education, in May last year.
That proposal suggested primary school pupils should be corrected if they
failed to speak 'standard English' - either in the classroom or in the
playground.
The new curriculum does emphasise written and spoken and standard English.
But at primary school children are only expected to be corrected on their
standard English where this is appropriate. Teachers would not need to
monitor language in the playground.
The new curriculum will also continue with controversial plans to introduce
a compulsory reading list of books, from which secondary school teachers
would choose a few titles.
However, the list will only be compulsory up to the end of the 19th century.
The government is likely only to publish an advisory list for literature in
this century, as literary opinion is divided over the merits of modern
authors.
Students will still be expected to read modern works.
