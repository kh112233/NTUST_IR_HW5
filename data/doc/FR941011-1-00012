The Proposal 



The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to realign J10
from the Twentynine Palms, CA, VORTAC to the Farmington, NM, VORTAC and extend J231 from the St. Johns, AZ, VORTAC
to the Twentynine Palms VORTAC. This realignment would reduce sector complexity northeast of Phoenix AZ, resulting
in more efficient utilization of the airspace. This action would enhance safety, simplify routings, and decrease
the controllers workload. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and
effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The jet routes listed in this document
would be published subsequently in the Order. 

The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
