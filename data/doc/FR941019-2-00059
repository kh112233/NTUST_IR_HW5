I. Introduction


 Statutory Framework


Section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 346a) authorizes establishment of tolerances
and exemptions from tolerances for the residues of pesticides in or on raw agricultural commodities (RAC's), and
section 409 of the act authorizes promulgation of food additive regulations for pesticide residues in processed
foods (21 U.S.C. 346(a), 348). 
Under section 408 of the act, EPA establishes tolerances, or exemptions from tolerances when appropriate, for pesticide
residues in raw agricultural commodities. Food additive regulations setting maximum permissible levels of pesticide
residues in processed foods are established under section 402 of the act. Section 409 food/feed additive regulations
are required, however, only for certain pesticide residues in processed food. Under section 409(a)(2) of the FFDCA,
no section 409 food/feed additive regulation is required if any pesticide residues in a processed food resulting
from use on a RAC has been removed to the extent possible by good manufacturing practices and is below the tolerance
for that pesticide in or on that RAC. This exemption in section 402(a)(2) is commonly referred to as the ``flow-through''
provision because it allows the section 408 raw food tolerance to flow through to processed food. Thus, a section 409
food additive regulation is only necessary to prevent foods from being deemed adulterated when despite the use of
good manufacturing practices the concentration of the pesticide residues in a processed food is greater than the
tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity, or if the processed food itself is treated or comes in contact
with a pesticide. Monitoring and enforcement are carried out by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
The establishment of a food additive regulation under section 409 requires a finding that use of the pesticide will
be ``safe'' (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)). Section 409 also contains the ``Delaney Clause,'' which specifically provides
that, with limited exceptions, no additive may be approved if it has been found to induce cancer in man or animals (21
U.S.C. 348(c)(5)).
In setting both section 408 tolerances and section 409 food/feed additive regulations, EPA reviews residue chemistry
and toxicology data. To be acceptable, tolerances must be both high enough to cover residues likely to be left when
the pesticide is used in accordance with its labeling and low enough to protect the public health. With respect to section
408 tolerances, EPA determines the highest levels of residues that might be present in a raw agricultural commodity
based on controlled field trials conducted under the conditions allowed by the product's labeling that are expected
to yield maximum residues. Generally, EPA's policy concerning whether a section 409 food additive regulation is
needed depends on whether there is a possibility that the processing of a raw agricultural commodity containing pesticide
residues would result in residues in the processed food at a level greater than the raw food tolerance.


II. Petition


Uniroyal Chemical Co. has submitted a petition requesting the revocation of the feed additive regulation established
under section 409 of the FFDCA for dimethipin on cottonseed hulls. The following provides background information
and sets forth the basis for the petitioner's request.
The section 408 tolerance for dimethipin on cottonseed is established at 0.5 part per million (ppm) (40 CFR 180.406).
The section 409 feed additive regulation on cottonseed hulls has been established at 0.7 ppm (40 CFR 186.2050). In
a peer review of dimethipin, dated January 5, 1990, EPA classified dimethipin as a Group C (possible human) carcinogen.
Dimethipin is the active ingredient in Harvade harvest growth regulants registered by Uniroyal. Uniroyal claims
that since Harvade is applied to cotton 7 to 14 days before anticipated harvest, a high percentage of the chemical is
deposited on the cotton leaf which subsequently abscises and drops to the soil surface.
Uniroyal Chemical is requesting revocation of the section 409 feed additive regulation for cottonseed hulls because,
they claim, that it is not needed and that revoking it will avoid any inconsistency with the Delaney Clause in section
409 of the FFDCA. According to Uniroyal, concentration of dimethipin in cottonseed hulls does not exceed the section
408 tolerance for cottonseed. 
To support the assertion that there is no concentration in the processed commodity, the Petitioner references a processing
study [MRID No. 42920902], which was submitted as a requirement of reregistration of dimethipin. Uniroyal claims
that this work demonstrates that dimethipin residues do not concentrate in cottonseed hulls (a processed commodity)
when compared with those in ginned cottonseed (a raw agricultural commodity) (MRID No. 42467001 and 42920901). The
study results are summarized below.
In this new processed fraction study, maturing cotton was treated with an exaggerated (2X) rate, resulting in an average
cottonseed residue of 0.563 ppm. Values for cottonseed hulls averaged 0.451 ppm. Only one out of four of the individual
sample concentration factors (values for which are -41%, -30%, -5%, and +7%) suggest a small possibility of concentration.
The mean factor of -17% indicates a net dilution of nearly one-sixth in generating cottonseed hulls from raw cottonseed.
Uniroyal declares that since the 2X rate produced no residue in hulls higher than 0.53 ppm, treatment at the full labeled
1X rate will not have a reasonable probability of producing residues in cottonseed hulls higher than the RAC tolerance
of 0.5 ppm. 
Uniroyal submitted a critique of two previous studies addressing the magnitude of dimethipin residues in cottonseed
and processed fractions. Uniroyal claims that the new study is better documented and more representative of real-world
conditions. In light of new data, the Petitioner urges EPA to reconsider whether a section 409 feed additive regulation
is necessary for dimethipin in cottonseed hulls.
Pursuant to 40 CFR 177.125 and 177.30, EPA may issue an order ruling on the petition or may issue a proposal in response
to the petition and seek further comment. If EPA issues an order in response to the petition, any person adversely affected
by the order may file written objections and a request for a hearing on those objections with EPA on or before the 30th
day after the date of publication of the order (40 CFR 178.20).
