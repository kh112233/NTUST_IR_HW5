FT  14 JUL 93 / World Bank lending soars: Loans reach record Dollars 23.7bn
THE WORLD BANK increased its lending by Dollars 2bn to a record Dollars
23.7bn over the past 12 months, with a sharp rise in new loans to recent
members in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
But political turmoil and a shift in the bank's lending strategy, away from
adjustment lending and towards individual projects, led to a fall in lending
to Africa.
New commitments there dropped to Dollars 2.8bn in the 1993 accounting year
which ended on June 30, compared with Dollars 4bn in the previous 12 months.
Commitments to Europe and central Asia rose to Dollars 3.8bn, compared with
Dollars 2.1bn in the previous year, largely because of Dollars 1.63bn in
loans to eight countries of the former Soviet Union which have just joined
the bank.
Overall, new commitments from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the core of the World Bank group, climbed to Dollars 16.9bn for
122 projects, compared with Dollars 15.2bn for 112 projects in fiscal 1992.
The International Development Association, the bank's unit which provides
low interest loans to the very poorest countries, committed Dollars 6.8bn to
123 projects in fiscal 1993, compared with Dollars 6.5bn for 110 projects in
the previous year.
The bank said preliminary figures for disbursements, or money actually
handed over to borrowers, showed an increase to Dollars 18bn compared with
Dollars 16.5bn in fiscal 1992.
While IDA commitments have been climbing steadily since 1988, IBRD lending
has been more stagnant, fluctuating between Dollars 15bn and Dollars 16.4bn
for several years.
Earlier this week, the bank unveiled a set of changes in management
practices designed to address criticism of over-emphasis on new lending, and
to improve the quality of its projects.
Reviews of its portfolios in countries such as India and Brazil has led to
Dollars 2.3bn of projects being cancelled outright, although most of the
savings are redirected towards other needs in the same countries.
