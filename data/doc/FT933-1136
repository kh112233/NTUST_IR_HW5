FT  25 SEP 93 / Investors still wary of the new S Africa: The decision to
lift sanctions may not spark a bonanza
AFTER three decades of isolation, South Africa can now re-enter the economic
community of nations following Nelson Mandela's successful call for the
lifting of sanctions at the United Nations last night.
While the normalisation of South Africa's international economic relations
promises considerable benefits, there is little anticipation of a short term
investment bonanza. A mixture of domestic political uncertainty,
international distractions, sanctions legacies and practical obstacles will
ensure that South Africa's rehabilitation is a gradual process.
In the US, which has been the most vocal and influential proponent of
sanctions, the most positive response was always likely to come from Mr
Mandela's most prominent supporters - namely Mr David Dinkins, the mayor of
New York, Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York state, and Mr Douglas Wilder,
governor of Virginia.
Mr Dinkins immediately announced that he was asking his city council to
repeal New York's anti-apartheid legislation, which could release cash in
city pension funds, some of which could be invested in South Africa.
Mr Charles Moses, executive director of the New York state governor's
Advisory Committee for Black Affairs, confirms that the state has been
working for 18 months on drawing up an International Partnership Programme
(IPP), an initiative that will cover economic development, trade, education
and support for small business.
An early response can also be expected from the IMF and the World Bank,
which are impatient to get involved in lending to South Africa. South Africa
is eligible for a Dollars 800m loan in terms of the IMF's Compensatory and
Contingency Finance Utility, while the World Bank has also made clear that
it stands ready to lend large sums in support of socio-economic development.
The Clinton administration, mindful of the political clout of the 43-strong
congressional black caucus, is expected to be supportive.
Expectations of the business community, however, are more muted.
Mr Jonathan Huneke, investment policy manager at the US Council for
International Business, an industry association representing about 300
multinationals, believes they will re-enter South Africa 'very cautiously,
very quietly and very slowly'.
Mr Huneke says there remains a 'residual distrust and scepticism' about the
ANC among his members, many of whom were 'vilified' during the 1980s for
their ties with South Africa. Although he acknowledges a 'metamorphosis on
foreign investment, appreciating that they need to cater to the interests of
business people', he says the ANC still has 'some way to go' before
businessmen are confident with its policies. Mr Huneke adds that investors
also have many more opportunities in new markets - notably in eastern
Europe, east Asia and Latin America - which were not available when the
sanctions period started.
The Washington based Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) believes
that investors will initially hold back from big investments, preferring to
set up branch sales and marketing offices, or assuming direct control of a
distributorship, while watching political developments.
Whatever foreign investment does flow is likely to focus on two areas in
particular: spending on infrastructure and consumer goods. The reasoning is
that a new government is likely to spend heavily on a social reconstruction
programme, while the rapidly urbanising black population, with rising
incomes, is targeted as a major future growth market for small ticket
consumer items. The IRRC suggests cosmetics, clothing, footwear, prepared
foods and non-prescription medications as likely consumer markets. It also
indicates computer and software companies as potential beneficiaries.
New investors are likely to seek partners in the black community, a route
already taken by Digital Equipment and the UK company Cable &amp; Wireless,
which this week was part of a consortium awarded a cellular telephone
licence.
Even if investors are keen to enter South Africa quickly, some will continue
to face practical obstacles. According to the IRRC, 179 local entities (30
states, 109 cities, 39 counties and regional authorities and the Virgin
Islands) had maintained some sort of restriction in their investment,
banking or procurement policies.
Although the US Senate and President Bill Clinton have urged that these be
rescinded, this will not take place overnight. Mr Bill Moses of the IRRC
notes that most states have adjourned until next year and in some cases,
notably Texas, state legislatures do not meet until 1995. Cities, counties
and public pension funds are often bound by legislative comment an waiting
periods.
In terms of portfolio investment, South Africa starts from a very low base.
A study of 47 global emerging market funds by the UK group Micropal shows
that at June 30 1993, only 0.07 per cent of their Dollars 8bn assets were
invested in South Africa. By comparison, on September 22, South Africa, by
market capitalisation, represented 0.85 per cent of the Financial Times
World Actuaries Index, measured in US dollars.
Mr Lloyd Pengilly of the New York brokers Mcintosh Martin says there is
relatively little foreign investment in South African stocks outside mining.
He says recent weeks have seen a lot of inquiries from US mutual funds about
the South African market, but this has not yet been matched by any
significant flow of funds.
He stresses that a 'terrific re-education process' lies ahead with most
portfolio managers ignorant of the market. This is borne out by a cursory
examination of Nelson's Directory, the US investment bible, which does not
list a single US analyst covering South African stocks.
Mr Pengilly believes that 'over time' there will be a flow of funds to South
Africa. Wall Street observers believe important US securities firms like
Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Smith Barney Shearson Inc and Lehmann Bros are
likely to re-enter South Africa.
