  [Text] The Afghan prime minister, Mr. Golboddin Hekmatyar, 
has welcomed the proposal of Pakistan to convene a regional 
peace conference in Islamabad for finding a solution to the 
current crisis in Afghanistan. A spokesman of Hezb-e Eslami 
[Islamic Party of Afghanistan], (Ustab Kariborrahman Seyyed), 
told Radio Pakistan's Peshawar representative that all 
possibilities should be explored to bring about permanent peace 
and stability in Kabul. Any temporary arrangement, he said, 
will bear no fruits. 
  Commenting on Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani's address to the 
nation, the spokesman reiterated that the president should 
relinquish power in favor of a neutral interim government 
without delay to save the country from further devastation. 
  Meanwhile, AFGHAN ISLAMIC PRESS reports from Kabul that 18 
top-ranking officials of Parcham Party committed suicide in 
Kabul yesterday fearing tough reprisal by Mojahedin.
