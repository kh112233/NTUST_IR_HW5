FT  14 APR 92 / Mandela and wife to separate
MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), said
yesterday that he and his wife, Mrs Winnie Mandela, had decided to separate
after 33 years.
The move follows renewed allegations that Mrs Mandela viciously beat four
young men in her Johannesburg home in 1988. One of them subsequently died.
Mrs Mandela yesterday denied these allegations, in a statement issued by her
lawyer, and Mr Mandela said they had nothing to do with his decision to seek
a separation.
Mr Mandela's voice broke with emotion when he read out a statement
announcing the separation. He praised his wife's role in opposing apartheid
and in resisting government harassment during the ANC leader's 27 years in
jail.
'My love for her remains undiminished,' he said. However the couple decided
to separate because tensions had arisen 'owing to differences between
ourselves on a number of issues.' Mrs Mandela takes a more radical political
stand than her husband, and her recent open marital infidelities have led to
scandal.
Though Mrs Mandela, 57, will remain head of the ANC's Department of Social
Welfare, her separation from Mr Mandela will remove a source of
embarrassment for the ANC.
