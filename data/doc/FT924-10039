FT  03 NOV 92 / Anti-nuclear activists lobby officials
Anti-nuclear activists lobby officials at Japan's Science and Technology
Agency yesterday against the sailing of a plutonium carrier for France. They
argue that the planned shipment next week of 1.7 tonnes of recycled
commercial-grade plutonium is too dangerous to transport halfway around the
world and is potential prey for pirates. Several countries have barred the
ship, the Akatsuki Maru, from their waters and its route is being kept
secret. Indonesia said yesterday it would prefer it to avoid the crowded
Malacca Straits.
