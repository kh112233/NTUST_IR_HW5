 Final rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 NMFS amends the regulations governing the harvesting of Antarctic marine living resources and/or other associated
activities by persons subject to jurisdiction of the United States by adding regulations for the protection of land-based
ecosystem monitoring sites designated within Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Living Marine Resources
(CCAMLR) waters. The regulations implement conservation and management measures promulgated by the Commission
for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (Commission) and accepted in whole by the Government of
the United States to regulate activities within Convention waters. The Commission, at its ninth meeting in 1990,
established a procedure for protecting sites within the CCAMLR Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP). Long-term
investigations of selected sites within CEMP will be conducted to monitor changes in the ecosystem. The Commission
determined that these sites are in need of the status of ``Specially Protected Sites'' similar to the program established
under the Antarctic Treaty. The intent of these regulations is to implement the agreed to procedures for CEMP.
