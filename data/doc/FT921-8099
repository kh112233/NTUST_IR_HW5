FT  19 FEB 92 / US scoffs at Libya's Lockerbie 'hearing'
THE United States yesterday dismissed Libyan legal proceedings connected to
the 1988 Lockerbie bombing as a travesty of justice, Reuter reports from
Washington.
The state department spokesman, Mr Richard Boucher, said a Libyan hearing at
which two Libyans, accused of the murder of 270 people who were on the Pan
Am jet, appeared was yet another delaying tactic.
The two men, Mr Abdel Baset Ali Mohammed Al-Megrahi and Mr Al-Amin Khalifa
Fhimah, appeared before the media in a meeting room at the Libyan Supreme
Court. The appearance, which followed what Judge Ahmed al-Zawi described as
a routine investigation session, seemed designed to put to rest reports that
Libya had hidden or executed them to evade attempts to have them extradited.
