FT  21 SEP 93 / Assad cool on deal with Israel
PRESIDENT Hafez al-Assad of Syria warned in an interview published yesterday
that only Israel had benefited from last week's outline peace agreement with
the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
He said there was no justification for the secret talks between the PLO and
Israel. 'In my opinion the PLO has lost, as have the Arabs,' he told the
Egyptian newspaper al-Akhbar.
Mr Assad stopped short of threatening to oppose the agreement, but said
there was nothing he could do to prevent conflict between those who
supported it and those who were against. 'If we wanted to oppose the
agreement we could have made it fail,' he declared.
But he said that he had told Mr Yassir Arafat that it was the PLO leader's
duty to unite Palestinians in order to avoid the risk of massacres.
Mr Arafat travelled to Amman yesterday for talks with King Hussein in an
attempt to calm fears that Jordan was being excluded from crucial issues
affecting the region. In spite of initial reservations, King Hussein has
endorsed the Palestinian deal. There has, however, been a noticeable shift
in policy over the past week from the traditional joint
Jordanian-Palestinian stance to one where the kingdom's interests take
priority.
The two key issues expected to be discussed by Mr Arafat and the king were
Jordan's economic relationship with the West Bank, and the future status of
the kingdom's Palestinians, who make up more than half the population.
