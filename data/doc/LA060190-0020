MORNING REPORT: ART 
Louvre Curator Cleared: Charges against the Louvre's chief curator of 
paintings, who had been accused of receiving a stolen painting, have been 
dismissed by a French judge. 
Pierre Rosenberg had been indicted in December 1988 of illegally receiving "The 
Gentlemen of Seville" by the Spaniard Bartolome Esteban Murillo. The painting 
had belonged to art collector Suzanne de Canson. The Lourve had bought the 
painting from Joelle Pesnel, a former nurse of De Canson's who is accused of 
swindling her. Legal officials said the case against Rosenberg was too weak.
