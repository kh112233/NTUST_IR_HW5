  [Text] Paris, June 1 (AFP) -- Chinese dissident Wang 
Juntao, recently released from prison in Beijing, arrived here 
Wednesday [1 June] on a visit to attend a commemoration of the 
failed pro-democracy uprising in the Chinese capital five years 
ago. 
  Wang, one of the leaders of the brutally-repressed Tiananmen 
Square protests in 1989, was sentenced in 1991 to 13 years in 
prison, the heaviest term handed to any of the activists. 
  He was released in late April and took refuge in the United 
States where he received medical treatment before coming here 
for a few days at the invitation of the journalists' group 
Reporters Without Borders. 
  Wang is to give a news conference here Friday on the just 
published French version of the book "Like a Blade of Grass in 
the Desert," by his wife Hou Xiaotian, about her fight to win 
his release from jail.
