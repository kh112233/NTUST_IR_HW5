FT  02 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo Steel earnings
downgrade leaves Nikkei lower
FEARS over lower corporate earnings, triggered by a Nomura Research
Institute (NRI) report, unnerved investors and share prices finished lower
after thin trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 73.75 down at 16,879.60 after a day's high of
16,971.00 and low of 16,821.31. The index firmed in early trading on buying
of telecommunications stocks, but fell later on selling prompted by fears
over lower corporate profits.
Volume dwindled to 170m shares from 266m, while declines led advances by 664
to 265, with 198 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks shed 7.96 to 1,276.25, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased
0.50 to 1,027.03.
A report by Nomura Research Institute, projecting that Tokyo Steel, a
leading electric furnace steel maker, would fall into the red next fiscal
year, prompted heavy selling. Investors were shocked by the report, as the
company has been a market favourite due to its high profitability relative
to blast furnace steel makers.
NRI revised its earnings forecast for Tokyo Steel to a pre-tax loss of
Y3.5bn from a pre-tax profit of Y20bn for the year ending March next year,
stemming from a plunge in demand for steel bars. NRI said Tokyo Steel could
cut its dividend as a result of the loss.
Tokyo Steel dropped Y370 to Y2,130, while other electric furnace steel
makers also lost ground. Toa Steel fell Y64 to Y919 and Yamato Kogyo Y100 to
Y1,100. Blast furnace steel makers were also weak, Nippon Steel losing Y5 to
Y292.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y15,000 at Y631,000 on active buying.
The issue has risen 6.9 per cent over the past month on reports that the
telecommunications group wants to raise its call rates.
Showa Shell Sekiyu, the oil refiner which came under heavy selling pressure
last week on its huge foreign currency loss, fell a further Y26 to Y775.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 59.13 to 18,046.48 in volume of 48.1m
shares. Trading on the OSE surged 30.5 per cent last month from January to
1,297.4m shares. OSE officials said that active cross trading, or selling
and buying back shares to realise profits on stock holdings, ahead of the
March financial year-end had pushed up activity.
Roundup
WITH THE exception of Bangkok and Singapore, the region showed strong
performances yesterday.

or some 3 per cent, lower at 910.52 in turnover of Bt4.1bn.
The bank issued a statement denying the rumours, which had started to
circulate after last Thursday's announcement of a capital increase from
Bt10bn to Bt20bn. The shares weakened Bt8 to Bt115.

per cent, to 4,517.59.

FCL, Carter Holt Harvey and Telecom, as the NZSE-40 index gained 21.01 at
1,587.04 in low turnover of NZDollars 25m.
FCL moved ahead 10 cents to NZDollars 2.49, Carter Holt Harvey 5 cents to

for power projects pending a court ruling on a petition for an electricity
rate increase. The composite index fell 24.98 to 1,494.39 in 408m pesos
combined turnover.
BOMBAY retreated sharply for the second consecutive trading session as the
market reacted to disappointments over the national budget announced on
Saturday. The BSE index closed at 2,571.18, down 81.22 or 3.1 per cent, as
brokers said that the biggest disappointment in the budget was that the
government did not cut corporate taxes.
