FT  22 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good time to write off Africa debt
Sir, Michael Holman is right to point out the shortcomings of the World
Bank's structural adjustment programmes in Africa ('Long snakes and short
ladders in Africa', March 15).
We have just returned from an Oxfam-sponsored visit to Uganda, where we saw
the impact of that country's debt burden on the most vulnerable groups in
society: orphans, people with disabilities and the poor.
Burdened with a debt burden of Dollars 2.6bn, Uganda is forced to spend one
third of its annual budget on repayments, more than four times what it is
able to spend on health and education.
We were alarmed to discover that nearly 70 per cent of Uganda's debt is owed
to multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund, whose rules forbid rescheduling.
Most outrageous of all is that, over the next five years, Uganda will be
forced to make a negative transfer of more than Dollars 200m to the IMF - an
institution which, by selling only 10 per cent of its gold stocks, could
write off debts owed to it by all the countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
This year sees the 50th anniversary of the World Bank and the IMF. What
better time to review the development role of these institutions and to
reward countries such as Uganda, which has done all it can under existing
rules to tackle its debt crisis?
