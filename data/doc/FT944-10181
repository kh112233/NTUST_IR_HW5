FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: MetroGas float to raise between
Dollars 130m-Dollars 160m
The Argentine government expects to raise Dollars 130m-Dollars 160m through
the sale of its remaining 20 per cent stake in MetroGas, the country's
largest gas distributor, writes David Pilling in Buenos Aires.
The international issue of 93.5m class B shares, being underwritten by
Credit Suisse First Boston and co-led by Dresdner Bank, Goldman Sachs and
Kleinwort Benson, is in the process of bookbuilding and is expected to be
priced at between Dollars 1.30 and Dollars 1.60 per share early next week.
Demand for the issue is said to be strong, as existing shareholders are
expected to raise their stakes in the British Gas-operated utility. British
Gas holds 41 per cent of MetroGas.
