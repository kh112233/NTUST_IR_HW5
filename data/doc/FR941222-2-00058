SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive world-wide license to
practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Application SN 07/945,515 entitled ``Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibodies
for Respiratory Syncytial Virus'' and related foreign patent applications to SmithKline Beecham Corporation,
of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America.



The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. It is anticipated that this license may be limited to the fields of treatment and prevention of
RSV infection in humans. This prospective exclusive license may be granted unless within 60 days from the date of this

not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
The patent application describes human monoclonal antibodies which bind and neutralize respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) antigenic subgroups A and B. These monoclonal antibodies may be used alone or in mixtures to treat or prevent
