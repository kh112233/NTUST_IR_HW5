LITHUANIA'S STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE 
It's fascinating to watch the Bush Administration's reaction to the Soviet 
Union's embargo against Lithuania. Maybe we'll go full circle; the World Court 
can condemn this action and then the Soviets can defy that body, just as the 
United States defied the court's condemnation of our embargo of Nicaragua. 
We've been trying for years to redesign the Soviet Union in our image, and it 
seems we have made a start. So far the Soviets haven't mined Lithuania's 
harbors as we did Nicaragua's, nor organized a Contra-style terrorist force to 
conduct hit-and-run raids across the border. Perhaps the Soviet Union will 
follow our example all the way and put up its own hand-picked slate in the next 
Lithuanian election and then spend millions to support that slate. 
Isn't it great that the world is finally following our example?
