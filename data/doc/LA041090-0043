CERRITOS FINDS TOLERANCE AMID ITS ETHNIC DIVERSITY 
It first came to Alex Beanum during his campaign for the Cerritos City Council 
12 years ago, when he figured he knocked on at least half the doors in this 
quiet enclave of stucco tract homes. 
As he trudged through neighborhoods that looked like a bland, cookie-cutter 
version of middle-class suburbia, it suddenly hit him: whoosh . . . the smell 
of curry. Next house: the sizzling aroma of soy sauce and peanut oil. A few 
doors down: a pungent cloud of spices whose origin completely stumped him. 
"I'd be standing at the door and then, bang!" said Beanum, who won the election 
and served eight years as a councilman. "You could smell the cultures." 
What Beanum detected with his nose were the first whiffs of a striking ethnic 
migration that even today is difficult to perceive with eyes alone in this 
sedate bedroom community. 
Cerritos, according to a 1988 study by two Cal State Northridge geography 
professors, is the most "ethnically diverse" city in the nation, beating such 
gateways of immigration as Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. San 
Francisco finished fourth; Los Angeles and New York didn't even make the top 
30. 
The study by James P. Allen and Eugene Turner was based on 1980 census 
information on 13 ethnic groups in more than 2,900 communities around the 
nation. 
"I think, like most people, we expected the larger cities like Chicago, New 
York and Los Angeles to come out on top," Allen said. "I was quite amazed 
because I didn't know anything about Cerritos." 
While much has changed in the decade since the last census, Cerritos has only 
solidified its claim to be on the exclusive list of diverse communities. 
According to data collected by the USC Population Research Laboratory, 
non-Hispanic whites had become a minority in Cerritos by 1986. Since then, 
their numbers have dwindled even further. They now constitute just a third of 
the population, followed by Latinos at 16%, Filipinos 15%, Koreans 13%, blacks 
12% and Chinese 7%, according to an estimate based on the USC study. 
For all its diversity, the city has largely managed to achieve what has been 
elusive for many Southern California communities: a tolerant coexistence of 
cultures. 
Beanum, a black, and Daniel K. Wong, a Chinese-American, have both served as 
mayor. Perry N. Barit, an architect who came to the United States from the 
Philippines 20 years ago, is now head of the city's Planning Commission. 
The ABC School District Board of Education, which serves Cerritos, currently 
has one Asian and one Latino among its seven members. In the last 10 years, two 
blacks and two Latinos also have served on the board. 
The real test of the city's diversity lies in its neighborhoods. On Beanum's 
small cul-de-sac, he counts whites, Filipinos, blacks, East Indians, Chinese 
and Koreans as neighbors. 
Many churches now have services in two or three languages and in the schools it 
is not interracial strife, but interracial dating that has become a vexing 
problem for parents and administrators. 
Cerritos Mayor Diana Needham said one reason she believes the city has remained 
peaceful is the rigid land-use plan the City Council drafted nearly 25 years 
ago. The council envisioned an affluent, progressive and tightly zoned 
community. That vision remains intact today. 
Its development into a suburban community in the late 1960s coincided with the 
enactment of federal anti-discrimination laws, a burgeoning ethnic middle 
class, and a booming demand for affordable housing. 
The city, which is still best remembered for the disastrous 1986 Aeromexico 
airliner crash that killed 82 people, is now known as an expensive pocket of 
suburban living in the sprawling urban stew of Los Angeles County. 
"While we are one of the most diverse ethnically, we are one of the most 
homogenous economically," Needham said. "We have no poor areas, no extremely 
rich areas. That's the key." 
Wong, the former mayor and now city councilman, said the pursuit of the good 
life in Cerritos has a well-scrubbed uniformity to it, driven by the 
upper-middle-class mentality that attracted people to the city in the first 
place. "It's a peaceful, harmonious bedroom community," he said. "That's what 
everyone came here for and that's how they want it to stay." 
Life in America's most diverse city, however, is still a far cry from the dream 
of the melting pot. It is more like a mosaic, residents say, of separate parts 
laid next to each other, divided by the city's very diversity of languages and 
cultures. 
One resident said she has never spoken with her Korean neighbors. "I don't know 
them," she said. "I don't even know if they speak English." 
At St. John's Lutheran Church, Pastor Donald Koepke tells of how six white 
families left the church after a Chinese-language service was started four 
years ago. "They said: 'This is no longer my community and now they're taking 
away my church,' " Koepke recalled. "I agonize over that." 
Even Beanum, a hulking, jovial man who grew up in a black community near 
Detroit and remembers the days of segregation well, said life in Cerritos can 
be as socially separate as when he was growing up. 
"Is it peaceful? Yes. Is it tolerant? Yes. But it is no paradise," he said. 
Drive down the four-lane thoroughfare of 195th Street, past the acres of soft 
beige tract homes and neighborhoods surrounded by cinder block walls. The city 
looks like any master-planned community where people wave to each other 
occasionally, but spend most of their time at work or inside with their 
families. 
Turn onto Gridley Road and head for the city's main commercial center, where 
instead of bustling ethnic shops as in Koreatown or Chinatown, flat tracts of 
homes are dwarfed by the Los Cerritos Mall and the rows of car dealers at the 
Cerritos Auto Square. 
In 30 years, the city has gone through a whirlwind transformation, from a quiet 
backwater dairy town with more cows than people to a modern suburban community 
where nearly every piece of land has been covered with homes or shopping 
centers. 
As late as the mid-1960s, there was nothing here but thousands of acres of 
pastureland. The city was called Dairy Valley -- home to one of the greatest 
milk-producing industries in the world with more than 100,000 cows and just 
3,500 people spread over the broad, open flood plain. 
The city incorporated in 1956 in an effort to protect itself from the spreading 
urbanization of Los Angeles. The dairymen feared expansion by the neighboring 
city of Artesia, which they believed was poised to zone the dairies out of 
existence in favor of suburban development. 
In a hastily arranged meeting, the dairymen gathered in the tiny offices of the 
Central Milk Producers and began their push for cityhood. The incorporation was 
approved in 1956 by a vote of 441 to 391. 
By 1967, the city had become ringed by suburbs and the dairymen eventually 
agreed to sell their land to developers hungry for one of the last major tracts 
of land in the metropolitan area. The city of Dairy Valley took the upscale 
name of Cerritos, or Little Hills in Spanish. 
It changed in the space of just a few years from an enclave of no growth to one 
of the fastest growing cities in the state. 
The first residents to move in were mostly white, but Beanum said a smattering 
of minorities were attracted to this new city rising out of the open fields. 
The homes were new, the prices reasonable and the place itself was so new that 
he figured there would be no rules, no ghetto boundaries, no tradition of 
bigotry. "It was like a clean slate," said Beanum, who bought a six-bedroom 
home for $34,000. "A breath of fresh air that smelled like a cow." 
Beanum said the first waves of people to move in all seemed to be the same: 
They were young, family oriented and uniformly middle class in their 
aspirations. 
He said that when he moved in there was an automatic bond as families talked 
about their children's schooling or the latest fads in home improvement. "It 
was great to come out here. We were all in the same boat together," he 
recalled. "You didn't care what color your neighbors were. The only thing you 
worried about was whether they were getting their lawn in fast." 
Beanum, whose wife is white, said that as their children grew older and 
graduated from high school, the bond between people began to loosen. With the 
average home price pushing $300,000 now, more and more of the old-timers are 
leaving. 
The largest influx of minorities has come in just the last decade, boosted by 
the migration of Asians, whose population has nearly doubled. 
Karim Mulji, a dapper, soft-spoken jeweler from Pakistan, moved to Cerritos 
three years ago, like many other Asians, because of its highly reputed school 
system and lack of crime. The migration of Asians to Cerritos, however, has not 
been nearly as smooth as the first movement of minorities into the city. 
The numbers have been far larger and the barriers of language and customs more 
difficult to overcome. 
It is a frustrating phenomenon that Koepke of St. John's has been grappling 
with for the last four years. 
Koepke, an energetic, gray-haired pastor who marched with the Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr. in Selma, Ala., started a Chinese-language service in 1986 
because of his belief that the church should reflect its community. His goal 
was to forge a single religious family from two disparate cultures. 
The task, however, has been more daunting than he imagined. "The challenge is 
to develop bridges, but we are not always creative enough to bridge the 
cultural gap," he said. "We have two languages, but not one congregation." 
In the parking lot on Sunday mornings, churchgoers at the early morning 
English-language service file out to their cars as the 40 or so people who 
attend the Chinese-language service arrive for their turn in the chapel with 
Koepke's co-pastor, Donald Wu. 
The Chinese and English groups meet several times a year for summer picnics and 
joint services, but Koepke said the dream of one religious family remains 
distant. 
Language is only part of the problem. Even Koepke is unsure if two groups that 
meet separately, pray separately and may even have different visions of God, 
can be forged into a single family. 
Others share Koepke's frustration in trying to bridge the gap between cultures. 
Planning Commission Chairman Barit said he is constantly trying to get Asian 
and white friends to mix at city or Chamber of Commerce function. But 
inevitably, he sees the different groups of people gravitate toward their own. 
"If you're talking about voluntary interaction, there isn't much," he said. 
"There is still the feeling that white is white and Asian is Asian." 
Barit said breaking down barriers has only become harder because of the large 
influx of Asians. When everyone was a newcomer 20 years ago, there were few 
conflicts. Today, Barit said, many of those who moved to Cerritos years ago 
feel the city is being overwhelmed. 
"I'm feeling the resentment," he said. "We are not trying to establish an Asian 
community, we are trying to establish an all-American community. It's just 
becoming Asian because we can't help it." 
In this year's City Council election, Korean candidate Charles J. Kim raised 
almost twice as much money as the other 12 contenders combined. Much of the 
funding for his campaign came from supporters outside of Cerritos. 
If there is one spot in the city where at least part of the dream of a melting 
pot has been achieved, it is in the schools. 
Mako Nagasawa, a senior at Whitney High School, said one reason for the lack of 
conflict is that no one group has become dominant, unlike Monterey Park, where 
the conflict between longtime residents and the large population of Chinese 
newcomers has been a constant sore point. 
Although Asians make up more than a third of Cerritos' population, the number 
of Chinese, Filipinos, Koreans, East Indians, Japanese and Vietnamese are small 
by themselves. 
"I don't feel like part of the majority," Nagasawa said. "At most schools, 
Asians are Asians. But here there are so many different Asians." 
His best friend is Chinese and his girlfriend is Korean, he said. "People 
expect you to mix here," he said. "That's the tradition." 
Loc Ta, a senior at Cerritos High School, said it's hard not to meet students 
from other cultures because there are so many different ones on campus. "There 
are no boundaries . . . for students, that is. You have to keep your mind open 
because you have no choice here," said Ta, who came to the United States from 
Vietnam when he was 3. 
Ironically, a vexing problem that school administrators have had to deal with 
is interracial dating. "I just spent three hours on that today," said Norman Y. 
Fujimoto, assistant principal at Cerritos High School, after a grueling 
counseling session. 
The students get along fine; it's the parents that are the problem, he said. 
"It all goes back to the parents, who are very much Korean, Vietnamese or 
whatever," he said. 
Ta said most of his friends have learned to adapt to their parents' prejudices. 
"I was going out with an Irish girl last year," he said. "I just didn't tell my 
mom." 
Eddy Luh, who graduated from Whitney High School, said it was a rude awakening 
when he left four years ago to attend Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. 
Luh, now a senior at Cornell, said it was the first time he felt the sting of 
being different. There was nothing dramatic, just small things, like feeling 
unwelcome in a bar or uncomfortable at not seeing other Asians on the street. 
After four years in college, Luh said, he has two groups of friends: one mainly 
white and another mainly Chinese. He has come to accept it as a fact of life 
that the two groups rarely mix. 
"When I left Whitney, I had a false idea of how the world is," he said. "When 
you see that it isn't that way, you steer off your line a little bit this way 
and then a little bit that way. 
"The idea that Whitney gave of racial mixing is the idea I've been trying to 
stay on," he said. "But that is the ideal you will never achieve again."
