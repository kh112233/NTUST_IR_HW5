FT  13 JAN 94 / Observer: EBRD's tasty morsels
Time was when the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development knew how
to throw a good party. But it sounds like this weekend's get-together of
EBRD top brass at an undisclosed destination on the English south coast will
not be a hoot.
Three months into the job, EBRD boss Jacques de Larosiere has concluded that
the problems bequeathed by his predecessor, Jacques Attali, are even more
severe than previously thought. Hence pay rises for most staff will be
limited to a maximum of 1 per cent this year and top-dog salaries will be
frozen. He also wants far more members of his staff to be based in eastern
Europe rather than London. Hands up volunteers for Novosibirsk?
But perhaps the cruellest blow is the closure of the EBRD's executive dining
room, which sounded like it deserved a Michelin star. Most days de Larosiere
eats in the staff canteen where he picks up useful tips by chatting up
younger members of staff. How long will that last?
