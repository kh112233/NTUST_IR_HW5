FT  27 OCT 93 / Tourists shot in Cairo hotel
A GUNMAN opened fire in the restaurant of a luxury tourist hotel in Cairo
last night, killing three people and severely wounding four others, writes
Mark Nicholson in Cairo. The attack is the worst on foreigners in Egypt in
the past 18 months, which has seen sporadic violence against tourists by
Islamic extremists.
Police said the gunman, who had been sitting in the Felucca restaurant of
the Semiramis Intercontinental Hotel, suddenly stood up and fired on diners
with a revolver.
The shooting is likely to be a devastating blow to Egypt's tourism industry,
already crippled by earlier attacks.
It happened on the same day as President Hosni Mubarak sought to assure his
US hosts in Washington that Egypt's recent security problems were resolved.
His confidence was based on a lull in attacks after security operations
against suspected militants.
An American, an Italian and a third person of unknown origin died in the
shooting, doctors said. The injured included another American, a Syrian and
a French citizen. The gunman and two others were arrested.
Last year an English woman was shot by extremists in Upper Egypt, while a
Turk and a Swede died in the bombing of a Cairo cafe in February.
