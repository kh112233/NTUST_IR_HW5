  [Text] Concern about relations with Moscow is apparently 
behind an Australia Government decision to keep secret the fact 
that six Russian spies were ordered out of the country last 
year. Last June, a former Australian security officer was 
charged with spying for the Soviet Union. 
  The six Russians left the country over the next six months. 
Their expulsion was revealed in federal parliament by an 
opposition backbencher, Ken Aldred, who was responsible for 
revealing the presence of KGB special reserve officer, (Valeriy 
Zenskov), in Canberra in 1988. He told Fran Kelly Russian 
intelligence activities in Australia had increased to an 
extraordinary extent. 
  [Begin recording] [Aldred] It is a fact that they have 
built up, particularly to a peak last year, which ultimately 
led, of course, to the officers involved being asked to leave 
Australia. It appears to have three or four SVRR [Russian 
Foreign Intelligence Service] officers -- foreign intelligence 
officers -- and about two GRU [Russian military intelligence] 
officers -- military intelligence officers -- are also asked to 
leave Australia as a result of their activities here. 
  [Kelly] What are these people doing here? I mean, are they 
spying? 
  [Aldred] Oh, yes. There is absolutely no doubt about 
that. There is a bit of a myth abroad because the old Soviet 
Union has collapsed, that in fact the Russian Federation does 
not operate any intelligence activities or at least no 
intelligence activities of any great note. The fact is they do, 
and in a number of cases, they have actually increased those 
activities, and of course, nowadays, and this was true in the 
latter days of the KGB as well, those activities are being 
broadened up for purely military concerns to also cover the 
industrial, economic area, and in fact, a lot of Russian 
interest, in terms of the Western democracy, is in the high 
technology area the industry has and they want to acquire for 
the Russian Federation. 
  [Kelly] Having a look at trade secrets? 
  [Aldred] Yes, we are looking at industries, trade secrets, 
new inventions, high technology, that sort of things as well, as 
well as purely military concerns and such things as shipping 
movements of allied ships in the Pacific and so on. 
  [Kelly] Is it surprising, though, that this kind of activity 
would have increased since the end of the Cold War. I mean 
surely there is less need now, less reason, for East and West to 
be spying on each other. 
  [Aldred] That's an interesting point. Certainly 
communism has collapsed, as we are all aware, in Europe. The 
reality is the new Federation is developing very interesting 
imperial ambitions. And in fact, they are making major moves 
over the last year or two to increase their influence of control 
over a number of former republics of the Soviet Union, in 
particular, Ukraine, Georgia, Belarus, and the Soviet foreign 
minister, Mr. Kozyrev, is actually on record in January last as 
saying Russia continued or would continue to maintain a presence 
in the Baltic states. So, certainly, communism is gone, but 
Russian expansionism has not. 
  [Kelly] How do we know that this is true? How aware is the 
Australian Government? 
  [Aldred] I think the Australian Government is probably 
aware of much of what is going on, and the question that really 
has to be put to them is why did they cover up the expulsion or 
the request for these officers to leave last year and not come 
clean with the Australia, actually tell people what has been 
going on? The Americans have been very open about what has 
happened in Washington in the last 24 hours in relation to the 
charging of the CIA officer, and the request it had made to the 
Russians for certain Russian intelligence officers to now leave 
the United States. I think, though, the government here should 
have been just as open with the Australian people. 
  [Kelly] Is it not always the case, though, these kinds of 
incidents are kept pretty quiet? 
  [Aldred] No. No, it is not necessarily the case at all. 
Where actions had been taken in the past, whether it has been by 
the British Government, the German Government, New Zealand 
Government, the American Government, or whatever, they have 
always been very open in public about what they have done. 
  [Kelly] It has been reported that Foreign Minister Gareth 
Evans, when he communicated with the Russian authorities about 
the fact the expulsion was about to happen, wanted to... decided 
to keep the incident secret because he said he felt it could 
harm bilateral relations. 
  [Aldred] I don't think that is necessarily correct 
because if you go back to past events with the old Soviet Union, 
when action was taken by various Western democracies against 
officers of the old Soviet KGB when they are expelled in a 
number of cases, trade and commercial relations went on as 
normal. It doesn't necessarily affect those relationships at 
all. 
  [Kelly] Why did you decide to expose it in the parliament 
yesterday? 
  [Aldred] I thought that people needed to know that in 
fact that the Russian intelligence services were very active, 
that they are still a problem, that it is naive to think that is 
not a problem, and that the government should come clean exactly 
about what had been done. [end recording]
