SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of September 22, 1992 (57 FR 43740), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2B4338) had been filed by Arakawa
Chemical Industries, Ltd., c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001. The petition proposed that the
food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of an aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resin, hydrogenated,
as a component of polypropylene intended for food-contact use.


FDA has evaluated the data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed use of the food
additive in polypropylene articles in contact with food is safe. The agency has also concluded that the additive will
have the intended technical effect, and that, therefore, 177.1520 should be amended as set forth below.
In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before September 26, 1994, file with
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resin, hydrogenated (CAS Reg. No. 88526470), produced by the catalytic
polymerization of aromatic-substituted olefins from distillates of cracked petroleum stocks with a boiling point
no greater than 220 




C (428 




F), and the subsequent catalytic hydrogenation of the resulting aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resin, having a
minimum softening point of 110 




C (230 




F), as determined by ASTM Method E 2867 (Reapproved 1982), ``Standard Test Method for Softening Point by Ring-and-Ball
Apparatus,'' and a minimum aniline point of 107 




C (225 




F), as determined by ASTM Method D 61182, ``Standard Test Methods for Aniline Point and Mixed Aniline Point
of Petroleum Products and Hydrocarbon Solvents,'' both of which are incorporated by reference in accordance with
5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies are available from the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race
St., Philadelphia, PA 19103, or from the Division of Petition Control, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition

of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St. NW., suite 700, Washington, DC

For use only as an adjuvant at levels not to exceed 25 percent by weight in blends with polypropylene complying with
paragraph (c), item 1.1 of this section. The finished polymer may be used in contact with food Types I, II, IVB,
VIA through VIC, VIIB, and VIII identified in Table 1 of 176.170(c) of this chapter and
under conditions of use B through H described in Table 2 of 176.170(c) of this chapter; and with food Types III,
IVA, V, VIIA, and IX identified in Table 1 of 176.170(c) of this chapter and under conditions of
use D through G described in Table 2 of 176.170(c) of this chapter.
