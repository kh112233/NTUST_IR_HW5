FT  22 NOV 94 / Cement market may face fines
The European Commission this week could announce record fines against some
of the region's biggest cement companies following a five-year investigation
into alleged illegal market-sharing agreements. Brussels officials yesterday
said they were very close to announcing a decision. Some 30 companies are
thought to be involved in the inquiry which, under Commission rules, could
result in fines of up to 10 per cent of the European turnover of the worst
offenders. The investigation originally involved more than 70 companies. The
shortened list is thought to include all the main suppliers including
British, French, German and Italian companies.
It would be the fourth time this year that fines have been imposed by the
Commission for alleged market-sharing or price-fixing by European companies.
In July, Brussels imposed record fines totalling Ecu132.15m (Pounds 104m) on
19 carton-board producers accused of operating Europe's 'most pernicious'
price-fixing cartel. In February, Brussels fined 14 steel producers more
than Ecu100m for price-fixing and market-sharing.
The cement investigations began in 1989 when officials staged a dawn raid on
the offices of 10 leading cement producers in France, Belgium and Germany.
The raids were ordered after customers complained of a low level of cement
imports in spite of large price variations between neighbouring European
countries. Imports have risen since the late 1980s but still provide a very
low proportion of total sales in most EU countries.
