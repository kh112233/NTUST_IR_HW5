  [Text] The city of Choa, capital of Cabinda Province, two 
days ago was attacked by the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] armed forces within the framework 
of defensive operations under way in the area. Americo Chivala, 
Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel correspondent in the 
area, says that during 23 June's attack at least 23 Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola soldiers were killed and 
several others wounded. The clashes lasted about 30 minutes and 
were dominated by rocket and mortar attacks. For a month now, 
the troops of the Luanda communist regime have been involved in 
an offensive against areas under the control of UNITA, which has 
already claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians. 
The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola are carrying out 
defensive operations to protect the civilian population in 
Cabinda.
