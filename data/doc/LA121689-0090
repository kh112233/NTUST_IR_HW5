BOMB KILLS 3 S. AFRICA POLICEMEN, INFORMER 
Three black South African policemen and an informer were killed when a bomb 
destroyed their car, police said Friday. 
A daily report on political unrest said the four men were traveling about 15 
miles from the Indian Ocean city of Port Elizabeth late Thursday when a bomb 
planted under the car exploded. 
The informer's identity will be withheld to avoid possible reprisals against 
his family, the report said.
