ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
COLLEGE OFFERS FREE CLASSES FOR ALIENS 
Golden West College is offering free classes for immigrants who are seeking 
permanent U.S. residency under the recent federal amnesty legislation. Classes 
will be conducted from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. on eight consecutive Saturdays 
beginning this weekend. 
The amnesty law requires applicants to show they are making progress toward 
learning English and learning about U.S. citizenship matters. The classes at 
Golden West College fulfill the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
requirements for progress in English and citizenship, said Donna Willoughby, 
associate dean of instruction. 
"These are adult classes, and there is no fee or tuition," Willoughby said. 
"Since classes are held on Saturdays, there is also no parking fee to park on 
campus." 
Willoughby said the classes are open to anyone who has applied for amnesty, 
including people who live outside Huntington Beach. She said there is no 
enrollment limit. 
Classes meet in the business building and in the library on the campus, 15744 
Golden West Ave. 
To apply for the classes, call Olga Benavides in the college registration 
office at (714) 895-8299. BILL BILLITER
