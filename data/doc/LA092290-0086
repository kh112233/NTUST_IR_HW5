CALIFORNIA MAN, 72, ENTERS NOT GUILTY PLEA IN WIFE'S SUICIDE 
A 72-year-old California man who helped his terminally ill wife commit suicide 
in a Detroit-area hotel room pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of murder and 
conspiracy. 
Detroit Recorders Court Judge Isadore Torres allowed an attorney for Bertram 
Harper of Loomis, Calif., to enter the plea. 
Harper is charged with the Aug. 19 death of his 69-year-old wife, Virginia. 
The retired chemical engineer earlier this month returned to California to 
await trial after posting a $25,000 bond and appearing at preliminary hearings. 
Virginia Harper, who had cancer, died after swallowing a mixture of pills and 
placing a plastic bag over her head. An autopsy disclosed that she died of 
asphyxiation. Harper admitted in a taped police interview that he tied the bag 
around her neck after she fell into a deep sleep. 
Bertram Harper said the family came to Michigan believing that assisted suicide 
was legal in the state, unlike California, where it is a felony.
