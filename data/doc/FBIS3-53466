  [Text] Foreign ministers of the Islamic Conference 
Organization [ICO] have called on the United Nations secretary 
general, Butrus-Ghali, to authorize NATO air strikes against 
ethnic Serbians in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The secretary general of 
the ICO, Hamid al-Ghabid, made the call during a meeting between 
members of the Islamic organization and Mr. Butrus-Ghali in 
Geneva. The Islamic countries repeated a call for the European 
Union to end an arms embargo on Muslims in Bosnia to allow them 
to defend themselves against Serbian and Croatian attacks.
