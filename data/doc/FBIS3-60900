<F P=106> [Interview with Kani Yilmaz of the National Liberation Front </F>
of Kurdistan (ERNK), who represents the interests of the Workers 
Party of Kurdistan (PKK) in Europe, by an unidentified STERN 
correspondent; place and date not given: "I Warn All Europeans"] 
  [Text] [STERN] The PKK was banned in Germany following 
attacks on Turkish consulates and shops. Does it still exist? 
  [Yilmaz] It never officially existed in Germany. Our party 
is the Kurdish families who live here. We work in their houses. 
And this is where this interview is taking place. Who wants to 
prevent that? 
  [STERN] How many followers does the PKK have in Germany? 
  [Yilmaz] About 200,000. 
  [STERN] Do we now have to expect new attacks? 
  [Yilmaz] If our existence is threatened, our people will 
react. 
  [STERN] What does that mean? 
  [Yilmaz] The PKK followers are considered to be "terrorists" 
when they break a few doors. It is not to be considered 
terrorism when our people in Turkish Kurdistan are murdered with 
German weapons. 
  [STERN] Can you explain that? 
  [Yilmaz] Take the massacre in Lice. There, an entire town 
was turned into rubble. These were tanks from Germany. Then 
the Kurds blew off their rage on Turkish institutions in 
Germany. So what? If the breaking of windows is branded as 
"terrorism," then our "terrorism" is "good terrorism." 
  [STERN] Do tourists in Turkey have to be afraid of the PKK? 
  [Yilmaz] Each German mark that a tourist spends in Turkey 
means the death of a person in Kurdistan. Therefore, tourism is 
a very serious target for us. The actions will begin in spring 
with utmost determination. No one should go to Turkey. We 
cannot guarantee the lives of Germans, either. I warn all 
Europeans: Whoever goes to Turkey endangers his or her life.
