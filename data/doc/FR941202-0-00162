ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 On October 23, 1992, the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992 (WBCA) was signed into law, the purposes of which include
promoting the conservation of exotic birds by: Ensuring that all imports of exotic bird species into the United States
are biologically sustainable and not detrimental to the species; ensuring that imported birds are not subject to
inhumane treatment during capture and transport; and assisting wild bird conservation and management programs
in countries of origin. This final rule implements procedures for the establishment of an approved list of species
listed in the Appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora that
may be imported without a WBCA permit because it has been determined that trade in these species involves only captive-bred
specimens.


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This rule is effective January 3, 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This final rule implements aspects of the WBCA, which was signed into law on October 23, 1992. This is the second of two
rulemakings under the WBCA; the first final rulemaking under the WBCA was published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 16, 1993 (58 FR 60524). The WBCA limits or prohibits imports of exotic bird species to ensure that their
wild populations are not harmed by trade. It also encourages wild bird conservation programs in countries of origin
by both ensuring that all imports of such species into the United States are biologically sustainable and not detrimental
to the species, and by creating an Exotic Bird Conservation Fund to provide conservation assistance in countries
of origin. The final rule of November 16, 1993, summarized the effects of the WBCA and established procedures for obtaining
import permits authorized by the WBCA.
