JANET ADKINS' CONTROVERSIAL ASSISTED SUICIDE 
In reply to "Ailing Woman Uses Doctor's Suicide Device," front page, June 6: 
Those who have watched in pity and revulsion relatives or friends deteriorate 
to where they are unable to control urine and feces, and cannot recognize us as 
they slowly die, understand Janet Adkins' desire to be remembered as an 
energetic and talented person. 
The controversy surrounding her death by assisted suicide contrasts our 
standards of life and death whereby we put to death those who do not wish to 
die, first the victims of murder and then their assailants, but do not grant 
the request of those who, for legitimate reasons, do want to die. 
Mrs. Adkins could have attempted suicide unassisted, but an attempt sometimes 
goes awry and the already suffering person is left in an even worse medical 
state. Other patients, for example those with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), may 
want to commit suicide but are too debilitated to effect the act. And by then 
they know that it is too late to leave life with dignity and avoid embedding 
terminal pathetic images of themselves in the memories of family and friends. 
Under proper medical scrutiny, assisted suicide offers an option to the anguish 
of life's dilemma: its inevitable termination. That the proper scrutiny may 
have been lacking in Mrs. Adkins' case may not be so much the fault of Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian, but of a medical-legal system that interferes with a private right 
to terminate one's life. 
The Quinlan case in New Jersey, where parents obtained a court order to 
disconnect their comatose daughter's respirator, sensitized the public to the 
right to die when all hope is lost. The Adkins case in Michigan may galvanize 
public consciousness to the right to die before all dignity is lost.
