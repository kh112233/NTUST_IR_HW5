TRAINS IN FATAL CRASH MECHANICALLY OK 
Investigators have found no evidence of mechanical malfunctioning preceding the 
collision of two freight trains this week that killed four and injured two 
others, railroad and federal officials said. 
Tests of the locomotives, the rail tracks and the elevated signals that warn 
railway workers of oncoming trains have indicated that the equipment functioned 
properly -- apparently raising the possibility that Wednesday's crash was 
caused by human error.
