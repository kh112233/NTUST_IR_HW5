LARGE SOVIET CONVOY LEAVES KABUL 
A large Soviet military convoy pulled out of Kabul in a snowstorm during the 
night, leaving only a rear guard Friday in the besieged Afghan capital. 
Afghan soldiers questioned by reporters said the column of tanks, armored 
personnel carriers and trucks full of soldiers took three hours to file up the 
road to the 12,000-foot-high Salang Pass. 
Soviet sources confirmed that a big convoy had left and said only 1,000 to 
1,500 troops remain, mainly guarding the city's airport. They are to be 
withdrawn over the next week, in advance of the Feb. 15 deadline under last 
April's Geneva accord. 
In an incident Friday, French journalist Jean-Francois Leven of the weekly 
L'Express was shot and slightly wounded by a Soviet soldier, a colleague said. 
The soldier reportedly was upset over Leven taking photographs.
