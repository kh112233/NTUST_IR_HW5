POLICE DEPARTMENT 'FIRES' A BAD DOG 
After 2 1/2 years on the job and $6,000 in training, Marko the police dog was 
deemed a flop and "fired" from the Sunnyvale Public Safety Department, a police 
spokesman said. "It's hard to say why the dog wasn't a good police dog," Capt. 
Steve Pigott said. 
"His performance just was not very productive." Marko, a German shepherd who 
joined the force in January, 1987, was replaced by a young upstart named 
Gauner. Three hours into his first job, Gauner made his first "find" -- a 
suspect in hiding. Since then, he has detected two other suspects trying to 
hide from officers, Pigott said. In his more than than two years on the force, 
Marko made only "four or five finds," the captain said. Although Marko is out 
of police work, his life hasn't gone to the dogs. He will live out his 
retirement at the home of his officer-handler, Pigott said.
