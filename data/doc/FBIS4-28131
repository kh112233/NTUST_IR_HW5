  [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- The number of Japanese 
tourists going abroad in 1993 hit a record high of 11.93 million 
despite the recession-bound economy, the prime minister's office 
said Tuesday [7 Jun]. 
  The figure represented an increase of 1 percentage point 
over 
1992, the agency said in its annual white paper on tourism. 
  The agency attributed the overseas tourism boom to the 
spread 
of the five-day work week in Japan, and the yen's appreciation 
against other currencies that has bolstered the purchasing power 
of Japanese travelers. 
  Domestic tourism improved, too, with the number of those 
taking trips involving a stay of at least one night at hotels or 
inns rising 5 percent over the year before to 204 million, the 
agency said. 
  Japanese tourists at home and abroad, however, were more 
cost-conscious, with the average travel-related expenditures 
dropping by 5 percent to 148,000 yen per household, marking the 
first drop in four years. 
  By destination, travelers to the United States accounted for 
30 percent of those taking trips abroad, followed by visitors to 
South Korea at 13 percent and to Hong Kong at 11 percent. 
  Men accounted for 57 percent of overseas travelers but the 
percentage of women in the total has grown steadily in recent 
years. 
  Women in their 20s accounted for 40 percent or 2.06 million 
of the total number of female overseas travelers, the agency 
said. 
  Men in their 40s accounted for 24 percent or 1.64 million of 
the total of male overseas travelers. 
  In sharp contrast with the trend among the Japanese, the 
number of foreign visitors to Japan in 1993 fell by 5 percent 
from the previous year to 3.41 million, the agency said. 
  An agency official blamed the decline on the stronger yen, 
which squeezed the budgets of foreign tourists. 
  The growing contrast left Japan's balance of accounts in 
international tourism with a deficit of 30.93 billion dollars in 
1993. 
  Japanese travelers spent a total of 35.92 billion dollars 
for 
their overseas trips, including fares, while their foreign 
counterparts pared down their corresponding outlays to 4.99 
billion dollars, the agency said.
