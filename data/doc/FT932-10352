FT  08 MAY 93 / Japan at odds over role in Cambodia
THE JAPANESE government was divided yesterday over whether to withdraw
personnel from a United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, as UN
officials alleged that Tokyo had recalled police officers to Phnom Penh
without UN permission.
Increased public criticism after the killing of a Japanese police officer
this week, and yesterday's dispute with the UN, have embarrassed Tokyo,
which sees the Cambodian operation as an important part of Japan's growing
international role.
A meeting of senior ministers yesterday agreed that the 600 military
personnel and 70 police should remain in Cambodia, but after the meeting Mr
Junichiro Koizumi, the posts and telecommunications minister, said Japan
should 'shed sweat but not blood'.
Mr Koizumi, influential in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said the
government should review the safety of personnel and 'seriously consider'
withdrawing from Cambodia, where attacks by Khmer Rouge forces have
intensified in recent weeks.
Meanwhile, Japanese officials said there had been a 'misunderstanding' with
the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), which
insisted that Japan had no authority to order its police officers back to
Phnom Penh from other parts of the country.
Untac officials said they were aware that some Japanese police officers were
returning to Phnom Penh, but they did not have formal permission from
commanders of the 3,500-strong international police force in Cambodia.
One UN official reportedly said some of the returning Japanese personnel
could be guilty of 'insubordination'. Six police officers have been
transferred to Bangkok, including two injured in the attack which killed a
policeman this week.
