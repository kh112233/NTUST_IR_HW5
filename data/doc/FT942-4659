FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Dollars 200m VAT loss from piracy
West European governments lost at least Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) in 1993
through VAT avoidance because of computer software piracy, according to
figures published this week, writes Alan Cane. Their losses were small,
however, compared with those of the major software companies who
conservatively lost a total Dollars 737m according to the Software
Publishers Association, with a further Dollars 436m lost by software
distributors and retailers. The total loss of Dollars 1.3bn comes close to
equalling the Dollars 1.6bn of software sold legitimately by software
publishers in western Europe last year.
The SPA comprises most of the world's major software houses, principally
US-owned, including Microsoft, Lotus and Apple. It has been campaigning
vigorously against counterfeiters, securing court orders to enter offices
and confiscate suspect disks and computers.
