FT  24 AUG 94 / New Argentine constitution today
Argentina's President Carlos Menem and some 5,000 officials will today swear
obedience to the country's new constitution. The ceremony promulgating it
will mark the informal opening of campaigning for next May's presidential
elections.
The 1853 constitution was amended mainly to allow Mr Menem to stand for
re-election when his term ends next year. The previous constitution banned
successive presidential terms. Lifting this ban became Mr Menem's overriding
political aim of the past two years.
As well as allowing the president's re-election to a second, four-year term,
the new constitution introduces a semi-parliamentary form of government,
broadens the powers of Congress and gives the judiciary greater
independence.
The constitution is Mr Menem's greatest personal achievement since his
election in July 1989. Last December, he overcame the opposition of the
Radical Party, led by former president Raul Alfonsn, by promising a number
of concessions in return for allowing his re-election.
The constitution incorporates referenda and entrenches a broad range of
individual rights and declarations of principles. These include recognition
of Indian lands and a restatement of Argentina's claim to the Falkland
Islands.
Argentina has protested to Britain over the UK decision to extend a fishing
exclusion zone around the Falklands, a government spokesman said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Buenos Aires. Britain confirmed it was extending the
zone to an area north of the islands known as the Gap.
Mr Guido di Tella, Argentine foreign minister, handed the protest to
Britain's ambassador, Mr Peter Hall, on Monday. Mr di Tella later criticised
remarks by British Home Secretary Michael Howard claiming there was 'nothing
to negotiate' over the islands.
London denies its decision to expand the fishing exclusion zone is related
to Argentina's renewed claims over the Falklands. But Mr di Tella called the
extension a tit-for-tat move.
