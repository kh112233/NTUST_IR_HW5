REMOVAL OF SODIUM COMPOUND SPILLED IN TRAIN DERAILMENT BEGINS 
Trucks have begun hauling sodium bicarbonate from a San Bernardino neighborhood 
where 15,000 cubic yards of the sand-like material spilled from a runaway 
train. 
Southern Pacific spokesman Jim Loveland said the railroad obtained a permit 
from the State Lands Commission to dump the sodium bicarbonate in the dry bed 
of Owens Lake in Inyo County. 
It will take 20 days and cost $500,000 to relocate the material, which 
originally was mined from Owens Lake. 
Health Problems 
Some San Bernardino residents, complaining of health problems, have pressed the 
railroad to move the sodium bicarbonate, which spilled from a freight train 
that derailed and killed four people May 12. 
But Inyo County environmentalists have fought the effort, saying the railroad 
should first have been required to complete an environmental impact report.
