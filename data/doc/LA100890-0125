WORK ON TRANSPLANTS NETS 2 AMERICANS A NOBEL 
Two Americans -- one who performed the first successful kidney transplant and 
one who pioneered bone marrow transplants -- won the Nobel Prize in medicine 
today. 
Joseph E. Murray, 71, discovered how to master the problem of organ rejection 
and, in 1954, made the first successful organ transplant, a kidney from one 
identical twin to another that functioned for 24 years. 
The work of E. Donnall Thomas, 70, lessened the severe reaction that bone 
marrow transplants can cause in the recipients. His work led to a cure for 
leukemia in 50% of cases, and in 80% of childhood cases. 
"This year's laureates paved the way for transplantation in man," said the 
award citation from the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute. 
Bone marrow transplants are now used to treat a variety of cancers and 
inherited diseases, and researchers are investigating their potential use in 
AIDS and other diseases. 
The award citation said Murray "pioneered transplantation of kidneys obtained 
from deceased persons. . . . The field was then open for transplantation of 
other organs, such as liver, pancreas and heart." 
Murray, who is affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, was in 
San Francisco for a medical conference when he heard he had won. 
"The thing about this that's marvelous is that Don and I both were in Brigham 
Hospital together," said Murray, a native of Milford, Mass. 
"He was a resident in medicine, and I was a resident in surgery. This was after 
World War II. We both started working in transplants together, but from 
different angles. It's marvelous to share it with him." 
Thomas said this morning from his home in Bellevue, Wash., that he had always 
thought his work was too clinical to win the prize. 
There have been 142 medicine prizes since the award was first given in 1901. 
Americans have dominated the prize, winning or sharing it 69 times.
