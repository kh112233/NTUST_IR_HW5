CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
GILROY; 
2 NEW WITNESSES TELL OF GALLO WRECK 
Two new witnesses say the wife of Gallo Winery co-owner Julio Gallo did not 
cross a highway center line before a fatal traffic accident, the California 
Highway Patrol reported. The CHP previously said two other witnesses claimed 
Aileen Gallo drove across the center line, causing the Jan. 2 crash on Pacheco 
Pass that killed the other driver, Sharon Kauk, 27, of San Jose. 
An attorney representing the Gallos told CHP investigators the new witnesses 
reported having seen the wreck, a CHP spokesman said. He said the new witnesses 
are a 17-year-old Salinas youth and a 23-year-old man from Modesto, the city 50 
miles northeast of the accident scene that is headquarters for Gallo, the 
world's largest winery. The CHP spokesman said the two reported that Kauk's car 
drifted into the path of the eastbound Lincoln Town Car driven by Aileen Gallo 
along California 152.
