  [Text] Algiers, June 8 (AFP) -- Gunmen shot dead three 
people as they tried to prevent a car bomb attack against a 
hotel in an Algiers suburb, before the blast seriously wounded 
three others, the EL WATAN daily reported Wednesday [8 June]. 
  The three men gunned down were all guests at the El Andalous 
hotel in the Eucalyptus district, a Moslem fundamentalist 
bastion of the capital, which was targetted on Monday night. 
  The bomb placed in the boot of the vehicle then exploded, 
badly injuring three people and causing major damage, the 
newspaper reported. 
  The blast was the third car bomb attack since Islamic 
extremists began a guerrilla war against the Algerian 
authorities early in 1992 and subsequently began targetting 
civilians as part of their campaign. 
  More than 3,000 people are estimated to have been killed in 
battles between armed gangs and security forces and in terrorist 
attacks, which began after the army in January 1992 cancelled a 
general election the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was 
poised to win.
