FT  10 DEC 93 / Singapore case can proceed
The judge in the Singapore trial of five people accused of breaking the
island republic's Official Secrets Act by prematurely disclosing an official
economic growth estimate has rejected defence calls for acquittal and has
ruled that the prosecution case can proceed.
Three economists and two journalists are charged with leaking an official
1992 second-quarter economic growth estimate of 4.6 per cent.
Last week the judge ruled that the prosecution had failed to make a case
against Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, director of the economics department at
the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Singapore's de facto central
bank, on the charge of communicating secrets.
But the judge then suggested to the prosecution, which is led by Singapore's
attorney-general, that Mr Shanmugaratnam face a new charge of putting
classified information at risk.
The prosecution has alleged that the growth figure was leaked to two
economists working for a regional securities firm during a meeting they had
with Mr Shanmugaratnam at the MAS. The economists then passed the figure on
to a journalist with the local Business Times, whose editor published it.
The case has been adjourned until February. All five defendants have pleaded
not guilty.
