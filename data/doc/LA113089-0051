IRS Seizes Redd Foxx's Home, 7 Cars: Comedian Redd Foxx, who starred in the TV 
series "Sanford &amp; Son," was left with only a bed in his house in Las Vegas 
after the Internal Revenue Service seized his home and seven of his vehicles 
for allegedly failing to pay income taxes from 1983 to 1986. The IRS said the 
seizures were made to pay $755,166.21 Foxx owed for taxes in 1983, 1984 and 
1986. It said Foxx had ignored four payment notices. Prince Spencer, Foxx's 
business manager, said IRS agents told the entertainer he could stay at the 
home until it was sold. Foxx filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
1983, citing $1.6 million owed the IRS from taxes before 1983 and more than 
$800,000 owed other creditors. Spencer said Foxx had cut his latest tax bill by 
a few hundred thousand dollars, paying the IRS everything he has been making 
from shows at the Hacienda casino since August. Foxx said he would have asked 
his show-business friends for help had he known the Internal Revenue Service 
was going to raid his home and seize his property. ALEENE MacMINN
