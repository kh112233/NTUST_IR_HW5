FT  21 FEB 92 / Panel opts for curbs on implants
AN advisory panel to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday
recommended that silicone gel breast implants not be available to the
general public.
The panel recommended that the implants be limited to a tightly controlled
group of women for breast enlargement who would be studied for possible
adverse health effects.
In the case of women with mastectomies or other deformities, the panel
recommended that the implants be available as long as the women agree to
take part in clinical studies.
Women wanting to have their breasts enlarged represent about 80 per cent of
the estimated 2m women with breast implants.
The panel's unanimous decision comes a month after Mr David Kessler, FDA
commissioner, issued a moratorium on the devices amid growing concern about
their safety.
