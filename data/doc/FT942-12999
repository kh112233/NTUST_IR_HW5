FT  27 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fly the Chunnel instead
Sir, I very much enjoyed your 'Business Travel' (April 20), especially the
section on various 'airports of the world'. However, I have to say that Ms
Rawsthorn's report on Charles de Gaulle airport was typical of a certain
Anglo Saxon arrogant wit (whereas your other airport descriptions struck me
as being quite neutral), as well as a collection of all possible cliches you
may gather on France - the foie gras, the expensive clothes, the
Concorde-travelling top models, le 'glamour', quoi]
I must have flown into, and out of, Roissy a good 100 times over the past 10
years, and have never had to complain about my luggage being 'pillaged', not
even opened. As far as our 'sticky-fingered luggage handlers' are concerned,
they, too, probably would be happy to wear Chanel gloves to handle Ms
Rawsthorn's personal belongings.
Much to many people's surprise, France has less 'numerous national holidays'
than many other European countries (I have to admit, however, that the point
on public sector strikes was more relevant). And I honestly have to say that
I have never had 'to wait - and wait' for a bus at the RER station, whereas
I have been stuck at Acton Town for half an hour (at least) because of a
signal defect on a quite regular basis . . .
What Ms Rawsthorn needs, and must be eagerly awaiting, is the Chunnel. She
will be able to shop until she drops in downtown Paris, and then not have to
worry about struggling all the way to Charles de Gaulle. And then enjoy
frequent unexplained stops in the beautiful English countryside on her train
journey back to London. Bon voyage]
