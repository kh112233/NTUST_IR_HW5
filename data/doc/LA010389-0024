THE WORLD 
A dealer, on trial for allegedly trading in thousands of stolen Nazi-era 
documents from U.S.-run archives, has handed over nearly 800 of the documents, 
the West German Justice Ministry said. Andre Huesken, a Hamburg dealer in 
military memorabilia, turned the material over to West Berlin court officials. 
A ministry spokeswoman said she did not know details of the contents. Huesken 
is charged with trading in goods stolen from the Nazi Document Center in West 
Berlin. He has been on trial since Dec. 5 with three other defendants. The Nazi 
Document Center, housing about 30 million files, is said to have the world's 
largest collection of Nazi records.
