Defense Contract: Irvine Sensors Corp. in Costa Mesa won a $2.6-million 
contract from the U.S. Army to develop and test a new generation of homing 
guidance sensors for the proposed "Star Wars" missile defense system. 
Under a 33-month contract with the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, 
Irvine Sensors will create and test a small, lightweight infrared guidance 
sensor for missiles designed to intercept enemy missiles and destroy them with 
the force of impact. 
The sensor, about the size of a sugar cube, would be able to recognize a target 
earlier and guide the missile to it with more accuracy during the last leg of 
an interception mission, said Myles Suer, director of marketing.
