IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION 
DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK. 
Defense Fraud Plea: The operators of a Burbank firm that manufactured 
temperature transducers for the Army's Patriot missile pleaded guilty to 
charges of defrauding the government of $500,000 by padding bills for the 
components. Michael Martin Zarachoff, 45, and Nanci Plath, 42, both of 
Northridge, admitted to a federal court judge that they overcharged the 
government in contracts over a three-year period by establishing a shell 
company to falsify bills to their company, Temcom Inc. The shell company, 
however, never supplied any goods or services to Temcom or the government, 
prosecutors said. 
Zarachoff, Temcom's owner, pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy, 
lying to the government and tax evasion and faces up to 15 years in prison when 
he is sentenced. Plath, comptroller at the firm, pleaded guilty to one 
conspiracy charge, for which she is expected to receive probation. (Court Case 
No. 90-855. Plea entered Dec. 4, 1990).
