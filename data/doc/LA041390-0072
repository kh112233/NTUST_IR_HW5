'CUSTODY' OF FROZEN EMBRYOS CHALLENGED 
A judge's decision to give legal protection to seven frozen human embryos went 
far beyond his authority and should be overturned, a lawyer said in an appeal. 
The ruling was made last September in the divorce case of Junior Lewis Davis 
and Mary Sue Davis. The only issue was what to do with the eggs that resulted 
from in-vitro fertilization. Mrs. Davis testified she wanted the embryos in an 
attempt to have children. Davis said he did not want the embryos used in any 
fashion without his consent. A judge ruled "life begins at conception" and 
accorded the embryos the same legal status as children would have in a custody 
dispute. He granted temporary custody to Mrs. Davis.
