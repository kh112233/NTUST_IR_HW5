  [Text] Brussels, Jun 22, AP -- BNS - The European Union's 
[EU] executive commission said Wednesday it has signed a 
preliminary free trade accord with Latvia and plans to conclude 
a similar deal with Lithuania on June 27. A statement from the 
commission said negotiations with Estonia are also nearing 
completion. 
  The agreements with the three Baltic states are part of 
wider 
EU efforts to improve economic and political links with the 
former communist nations of eastern Europe. The EU has already 
wide- ranging trade accords with the Czech and Slovak Republics, 
Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. 
  Last week Ukraine became the first former Soviet nation to 
conclude such a deal with the EU, and Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin will sign one Friday at a meeting of EU leaders in 
Corfu, Greece. 
  The commission said it expects to finalize the agreement 
with 
Latvia by Jan. 1. on setting up a free trade zone for 
industrial goods within four years. During those years, Latvian 
products will freely enter the 12-nation trade bloc. Latvia may 
retain some export and import restrictions on some industrial 
products and farm goods. 
  The commission hopes to establish a free-trade zone with 
Estonia by the end of the year. That would overcome a 
difficulty created by Finland's plans to join the EU on Jan. 1, 
as Finland already has a free trade accord with Estonia. For 
Latvia and Lithuania, the accords foresee transition periods 
allowing them to reach the level of economic development already 
attained in Estonia.
