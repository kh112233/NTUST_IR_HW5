  [Text] STAR TV viewers will lose the BBC World Service 
channel in less than a month, it was confirmed last night. 
  It will be replaced by 24-hour screening of Mandarin movies 
from April 17. 
  The decision follows the settlement out of court of a 
dispute 
between the BBC and STAR which arose shortly after media mogul 
Rupert Murdoch bought a controlling interest in STAR last summer. 
  Under the terms of the agreement, the transmission of the 
BBC's news and information channel on the northern beam of the 
satellite used by STAR -- serving Northeastern China, Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, Korea and Mongolia -- will cease. 
  Deputy director-general of the BBC Bob Phyllis said the 
corporation regretted the contraction or withdrawal of any of 
its services to worldwide audiences. 
  However, he said: "The agreement with STAR TV places no 
restriction on the BBC's future access to these major and 
important potential audiences and we will be doing everything 
possible to establish an alternative means of delivery to the 
peoples of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong at the earliest 
opportunity." 
  The World Service will continue to be transmitted on STAR's 
southern beam until March 31, 1996. This means most of 
Continental Asia, including India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, will 
still receive the service. 
  It has been suggested that Mr Murdoch was opposed to the 
editorial independence of the BBC. During a visit to India last 
month, he is reported to have said, in the wake of the BBC 
documentary on Mao Zedong, that the corporation was a liability. 
  Mr Murdoch has also accused the BBC of bias against China 
and 
India.
