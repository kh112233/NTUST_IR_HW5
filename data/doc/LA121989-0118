BRIEFLY 
ARGENTINA TO FLOAT AUSTRAL: Argentina's new economy minister, Antonio Erman 
Gonzalez, announced that the country's currency, the austral, will be allowed 
to float against the dollar and that all foreign-exchange controls will be 
scrapped as part of a plan to beat the country's hyper-inflation. In a speech 
made just after being sworn in by President Carlos Menem, Gonzalez said he also 
would end all price controls as well as an 11% rise in duty on farm exports 
that his predecessor, Nestor Rapanelli, announced last week. He did not specify 
when the new measures would take effect.
