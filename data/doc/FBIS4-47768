  [Text] Isabel Allende, vice foreign minister of Cuba, 
stated in Havana that the triumph of Nelson Mandela, candidate 
of the African National Congress [ANC] in the elections in South 
Africa, signifies the defeat of the discriminating regime of 
apartheid. She said that his victory constitutes the definitive 
word on the future of South Africans and on the equality of men, 
not only on that continent but in all the world. 
  The Cuban vice foreign minister noted that in that triumph 
there is something of the work of Cuba and of the thousands of 
Cubans who died in Angola defending the human rights of the 
African people. This is why it represents for her country much 
more than a mere electoral triumph. 
  She noted that Cuba would like to have diplomatic relations 
with an ANC government in South Africa. It is in the interests 
of both countries, but we must wait for that government to take 
office and for the situation to evolve, she said.
