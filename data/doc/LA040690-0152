ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; 
MAN'S LEGS CRUSHED BY FREIGHT TRAIN 
A 19-year-old man was critically injured Thursday when his legs were crushed by 
a freight train. 
Both his legs were amputated during surgery at Mission Hospital Regional 
Medical Center in Mission Viejo, a nursing supervisor said. 
Juan Carlos Cruz, who authorities believe is from Mexico, apparently was trying 
to jump onto the Santa Fe train when he fell under the moving cars, said Lt. 
Richard J. Olson, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
The accident occurred near Camino Capistrano and Doheny Park Road about 8:40 
a.m. 
Cruz was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo, 
where surgery was performed Thursday afternoon and evening. 
A spokesman for Santa Fe said that the 52-car train was going from San Diego to 
Barstow and had stopped at a siding around the time of the accident. 
Mike Martin, Santa Fe spokesman, estimated the train was traveling at about 10 
m.p.h. when the accident occurred.
