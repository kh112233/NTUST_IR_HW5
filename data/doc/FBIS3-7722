  [Text] Croatian Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader today 
delivered a protest note to Andrej Zlebnik, charge d'affaires at 
the Slovene Embassy in Zagreb, in the absence of Slovene 
Ambassador Malesic. The note refers to frequent incidents 
involving Slovene police in Croatian territorial waters in Piran 
Bay. 
  The note says that such incidents preempt a final solution 
of 
the border problem in Piran Bay, which is being addressed by a 
joint Croatian-Slovene diplomatic border commission. 
  Deputy Minister Sanader says that Croatia is interested in 
maintaining good neighborly relations with Slovenia and solving 
all open issues by mutual agreement.
