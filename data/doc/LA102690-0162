LOCAL ELECTIONS STATE SENATE; 
DILLS ARGUES FOR VALUE OF EXPERIENCE; 
LEGISLATURE: VETERAN LAWMAKER SPEAKS AGAINST PROPOSITIONS THAT LIMIT TERMS, 
SAYING HE IS JUST WARMING UP. INCUMBENTS IN TWO LOCAL RACES ARE EXPECTED TO 
WIN. 
Eighty-year-old state Sen. Ralph C. Dills does not take kindly to talk of 
legislative term limits. 
A candidate for reelection on Nov. 6, the Gardena Democrat spent a decade in 
the Assembly and now has served in the Senate for nearly a quarter of a 
century. And Dills says he's just warming up. 
"I have legislators coming to me all the time for advice, saying, 'How did you 
guys do this?' and 'How did you guys do that?' " Dills said, citing his 
firsthand knowledge of numerous state legislative sessions. "I think that kind 
of experience is important to have in Sacramento." 
Dills, who faces Republican Timothy Poling in next month's balloting, is one of 
two South Bay state senators up for reelection this year. 
The other, Diane E. Watson (D-Los Angeles), is virtually unopposed. Her only 
challenger, Ivan William Kasimoff of the Peace and Freedom Party, could not be 
reached by telephone and is reported to have moved out of the district. 
Although Dills drew a GOP challenger, he does not appear in danger of losing 
his seat. Poling, a 25-year-old engineer with McDonnell Douglas, is a political 
novice who is short on name recognition and campaign funds. 
Still, there are sharp contrasts between the two candidates in the mostly 
blue-collar 30th Senate District, which encompasses Carson, Gardena, Harbor 
City, Wilmington, Paramount, Lynwood and parts of Long Beach and San Pedro. 
A key arguing point is term limits, which are proposed in two of the questions 
on the Nov. 6 ballot -- Propositions 140 and 131. 
Poling supports Proposition 140, the toughest of the term-limit measures. "It 
will be healthy," he said. "It's like what we do at the national level with 
presidents." 
In the case of state legislators, Proposition 140 would limit senators to two 
four-year terms, or eight years in office, and Assembly members to three 
two-year terms, or six years in office. The limits would apply to anyone 
elected on or after Nov. 6. 
Dills argues that if experienced lawmakers are forced from office, the 
Legislature will lose much of its institutional memory. That, he says, would 
deprive the Assembly and Senate of important guidance. 
He cites his participation in debate this year on child care policy. He says he 
drew heavily on his experience as an assemblyman during World War II, when 
child care programs were created so women could take factory jobs to bolster 
the war effort. 
"We had the same type of programs then so Rosie the Riveter could go to work," 
said Dills, who served in the Assembly from 1939 to 1949 and has held a seat in 
the state Senate since 1966. 
Poling asserts that term limits are the only way to break the incumbents' grip 
on power, which he says has stifled electoral competition and contributed to 
voter apathy. 
"Mr. Dills is right that there's a potential to lose a lot of experience," 
Poling acknowledged. "But right now, incumbents are almost guaranteed to win." 
The candidates also disagree on education policy. Poling says the current 
public education system is wasting taxpayers' money. He advocates a program 
under which the government would give parents vouchers to send their children 
to public or private schools. 
"This is America, where we believe in freedom of choice and free enterprise," 
Poling said. "If public schools can't compete with the private schools, maybe 
they would change their ways or go out of business." 
Dills says the voucher system would ultimately hurt students from low-income 
families by crippling the public school system. "It's an elitist kind of thing 
that goes under the headline of parental choice," he said. 
Nor do Dills and Poling agree on Proposition 128, or "Big Green," the vast 
environmental initiative aimed at removing toxics from California's food, water 
and air. 
Poling opposes the measure, calling it too costly and complex. Dills supports 
it -- with some reservations about how tightened environmental controls will 
affect the economy. 
"We all like fresh air and water," Dills said, "but there is something we have 
to look at: the impact on jobs." 
Such debate is absent in the 28th Senate District, which includes Inglewood, 
Hawthorne, Lawndale, part of South-Central Los Angeles, Marina del Rey, Playa 
del Rey, Westchester and part of Culver City. 
Although heavy Democratic voter registration in the district is considered a 
key reason for the absence of competition, Watson, the incumbent, says voter 
satisfaction may also be a factor. 
In Sacramento, Watson has emerged as a strong proponent of causes including 
abortion rights and child care. 
This year, she authored a proposal on the Nov. 6 ballot -- Proposition 151 -- 
that would allow the state to sell bonds to raise $30 million for the 
construction and renovation of child care facilities. 
Her tenure has also been marked by controversy over finances. In December of 
last year, Watson agreed to pay the state more than $21,000 in fines rather 
than face a civil lawsuit alleging that she put campaign funds to her personal 
use. 
Locally, Watson has drawn praise and criticism for her role in negotiations 
that followed a student walkout in the Centinela Valley Union High School 
District in March. Critics, including district officials and the teachers 
union, have accused her of interfering in district affairs, but others see her 
activism as an effort to ease racial tensions in the district. 
"I've tried to serve the district well, to relate to every area of the 
district," said Watson, who is seeking a fourth term. "I hope that is what 
accounts for the lack of (campaign) opposition."
