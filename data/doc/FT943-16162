FT  06 JUL 94 / MPs to probe Hualon project
The recently established Commons Northern Ireland committee is to probe
aspects of the Pounds 157m Hualon textile project as part of its inquiry
into employment creation in the province.
The cross-party body is expected to question representatives of Northern
Ireland's Industrial Development Board on the subject later this year. A
decision on whether to question ministers will be taken later.
The project, to build a Belfast textiles plant, became the subject of
controversy in May when it emerged that the European Commission overrode
strong objections from its own officials in approving a Pounds 61m UK
government grant.
The plant - to be built by a Malaysian division of Hualon, a Taiwanese
conglomerate - will represent the largest industrial investment in Northern
Ireland since the failed De Lorean car venture.
Two of Hualon's top managers have been charged in connection with an alleged
share fraud.
