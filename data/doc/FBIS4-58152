  [Text] Our foreign minister, Dr. Velayati, returned to 
Tehran from New York last night and described the special 
session of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] contact 
group with the United Nations Security Council as unprecedented. 
The session was proposed by Iran and held at UN Headquarters 
with the efforts of the members of the contact group. 
  Dr. Velayati said: The extensive protest by Islamic 
countries about the Security Council's performance regarding 
Bosnia-Herzegovina resulted in the Security Council agreeing to 
send a 7,000-strong unit, that will include troops from Islamic 
countries such as Malaysia and Pakistan. According to the 
Central News Unit, Dr. Velayati commented on the demand by 
Islamic countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, to 
lift the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina. He added: The ICO 
member countries are to draft a resolution on this issue and 
submit it to the Security Council. In the event of a veto by 
one of the Security Council members, the issue of lifting the 
arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina will be proposed to the UN 
General Assembly.
