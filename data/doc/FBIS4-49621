  [Text] Aviation leaders have vowed to tighten airline 
security and prevent hijackings by urging staff to take all 
possible safety measures. 
  "It is a must to strictly enforce rules for air 
security--from ticket sales, passenger and luggage check-in, 
boarding, on-board inspection--to deal with air piracy," said 
Chen Guangyi, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China 
(CAAC). 
  CAAC will resolutely probe hijacking cases, punish those 
responsible and take swift counter-measures. Chen told a 
conference in Fuzhou, provincial capital of Fujian. 
  The city sits directly across the straits from Taiwan, where 
many hijackers have attempted to force planes to land. 
  Chen also expressed hope that Taiwan authorities would 
co-operate with the mainland to crack down on air piracy. 
  "We are awaiting a treaty between the mainland's Association 
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and the Taiwan's Straits 
Exchanges Foundation on repatriation of hijackers" he said. 
  "Once both sides can join hands in the war against air 
piracy 
and force hijackers back to where they flew from, we can root 
out these crimes for the safety of the travelling public." 
  CAAC's anti-hijacking campaign had a direct impact last year 
when officials issued a series of rules on tightening air 
defence, expanded air security employment and installed more 
safety check devices. 
  Security departments foiled six hijacking attempts, detected 
45 suspects with concealed firearms or knives, and confiscated 
contraband and other dangerous articles. 
  In a letter to the meeting, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua 
cautioned 
that air security should do its utmost to prevent hijackings.
