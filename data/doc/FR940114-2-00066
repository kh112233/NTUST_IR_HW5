SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 A DMF is a submission to FDA that may be used to provide confidential, detailed information about facilities, processes,
or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of one or more human drugs (see 21 CFR 314.420).
The submission of a DMF is not required by law or FDA regulation. A DMF is submitted solely at the discretion of the holder.
The information contained in the DMF may be used to support an investigational new drug application, a new drug application,
an abbreviated new drug application, another DMF, an export application, or amendments and supplements to any of
these. FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) reviews the DMF only when it is referenced in such submissions.



Five types of DMF's exist regarding the following topics: Type I_ manufacturing site, facilities, operating procedures,
and personnel; Type II_drug substance, drug substance intermediate, and material used in their preparation, or
drug product; Type III_packaging material; Type IV_excipient, colorant, flavor, essence, or material used in their
preparation; and Type V_FDA-accepted reference information. 
CDER is considering ways to improve the DMF system, especially Type II DMF's, which often constitute a critical part
of a submission. The workshop will focus on alternative ways for CDER to review Type II DMF's for drug substances and
intermediates. CDER's Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Coordinating Committee has recommended changes
to the DMF review process in a report entitled ``Recommendations for Improvement in FDA's Drug Master File System,''
dated November 2, 1993. The report is available from the Freedom of Information Office (address above) or may be viewed
at the Dockets Management Branch (address above) [Docket No. 90S0308 (document #M203)].
