IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
APPROVED DRUG INEFFECTIVE IN NEW ALZHEIMER'S STUDY 
The only government-approved drug for treating Alzheimer's disease appears to 
be completely ineffective, researchers reported last week. A study involving 80 
people with the degenerative brain condition found no evidence that the drug 
Hydergine could improve their mental capacities, said Dr. Troy Thompson II of 
Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. 
In the study, 39 Alzheimer's patients were given oral daily doses of Hydergine 
for 24 weeks while 41 patients received a placebo. Those in the Hydergine group 
averaged 72 years of age and those in placebo group had an average age of 70. 
At the start of the study, participants were given a series of tests to measure 
their mental capacity. The tests were repeated after the 24-week treatment 
period. "The Hydergine-LC group did not perform better after treatment than the 
placebo group on any test," the researchers reported, "and its performance was 
worse" on one cognitive and one behavioral measure than that of the placebo 
recipients. 
The mental abilities of both groups deteriorated during the treatment, and 
there were indications from the test results that "the Hydergine-LC group 
actually had more deterioration than the placebo group."
