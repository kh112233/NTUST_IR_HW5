<F P=106> [Report signed "C.S.": "Counterfeit Dollar Gang: Leader </F>
Arrested in Vienna"] 
  [Text] The head of the gang that wanted to circulate some 
970,000 counterfeit dollars in the Vienna area is in prison: 
Alfred Hanl, 46 and a businessman from Vienna, was arrested in 
Vienna on Sunday [9 January]. It is not yet known if there is a 
direct connection with the producers of the counterfeit money. 
What is certain, however, is that it was made abroad. 
  Counterfeit dollars worth some 11 million schillings were 
seized in Salzburg on Friday, and seven suspects were arrested. 
Now the identities of those arrested have been released: Hanl's 
closest collaborator is Elmar Geisler, 56, from Vienna. The 
messengers who wanted to hand the counterfeit money to those 
distributing it near Salzburg were Johann Erben, 54, from 
France; Hans Hrabak, 56, who lives in Vienna and Zurich; and 
Helmut Boidol, 45, from Schallstadt, Germany. 
  Erben and Boidol are also thought to be those responsible 
for 
getting the counterfeit dollars to Austria from abroad. 
  In addition, counterfeit money messengers Hans W. (31), a 
computer expert from Paech in Switzerland; Peter S., 50, from 
Vienna; and Alfred P., 39, from St. Andrae-Woerdern, Austria, 
were also arrested. House searches have been ordered at the 
dwellings of all those who were arrested.
