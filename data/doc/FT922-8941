FT  11 MAY 92 / 28 die in run-up to Manila elections
FILIPINOS go to the polls today to elect a president to replace Mrs Corazon
Aquino after a campaign marked by growing violence and accusations of
intimidation and intended fraud.
Police said communist rebels of the New People's Army killed 17 policemen
yesterday in a dawn ambush in the northern province of Cagayan, and seven
civilians were reported to have been killed by two explosions on Saturday at
campaign rallies on the southern island of Mindanao. Violence elsewhere took
the weekend death toll to 28.
The various political and family factions competing in the elections for the
presidency, the vice-presidency, the congress and some 17,000 local
government posts have accused one another of sending death threats and
planning to stuff ballot boxes, and the climate of instability has prompted
fears of a coup.
The violence and the recriminations, however, did little to dampen the
enthusiasm of voters attending flamboyant weekend rallies enlivened by
firework displays, popular music and the appearance of local film stars  - a
crucial ingredient for electoral success in the Philippines.
Among the seven presidential candidates are Mr Ramon Mitra, the speaker of
the House of Representatives and standard-bearer of the majority party in
congress, the Laban ng Democratikong Pilipino, and Mr Fidel Ramos, the
former defence chief backed by Mrs Aquino. Mrs Imelda Marcos is also
standing, but her chances are regarded as slim.
