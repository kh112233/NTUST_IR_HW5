  [Excerpt] Asyut, Egypt, Dec 29 (AFP) -- A policeman was 
killed along with a suspected Moslem militant in Upper Egypt on 
Wednesday during a huge operation to track down fundamentalists, 
police said. 
  More than 1,000 policemen, supported by a helicopter, took 
part in the search for members of the outlawed al-Jama'ah 
al-Islamiyah organisation on al-Badari island, 40 kilometres (25 
miles) south of Asyut. 
  Police said Salah Mahmud 'Atiyah, the al-Jama'ah leader on 
the island, was killed along with a policeman in an exchange of 
fire. 
  A civilian and a police officer were wounded in the clash. 
  Three suspected Moslem militants were arrested and a large 
haul of arms was seized. 
  Al-Badari island, regarded as a militant stronghold in Asyut 
province, has been the target of several police operations 
during the year. [passage omitted]
