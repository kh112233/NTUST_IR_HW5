SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 



I. Background



In accordance with the procedures described in 170.35 (21 CFR 170.35), CPC International Inc., International
Plaza, Englewood Cliffs, NJ 07632, submitted a petition (GRASP 3G0284) requesting that 




-amylase enzyme from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 used in the production of nutritive saccharides from starch be affirmed as GRAS as a direct human food ingredient.
The petition includes information about the identity of, and manufacturing processes for, 




-amylase enzyme preparations derived from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

; information about the history of human food use of 




-amylase derived from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

; final reports and published articles of safety studies with 




-amylase enzyme preparation derived from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

; and published literature with respect to 




-amylase and bacterial 




-amylase preparations.
FDA published a notice of the filing of this petition in the 

Federal Register

 of September 21, 1983 (48 FR 43096). FDA gave interested persons an opportunity to submit comments to the Dockets Management
Branch (address above). FDA did not receive any comments in response to that notice. 
In the filing notice the agency gave notice that the petition had requested that 




-amylase enzyme derived from B. stearothermophilus be affirmed as GRAS for use in production of sweeteners from starch.
However, the petition requested, and the agency evaluated, the use of this enzyme preparation in the production of
nutritive saccharides (which includes maltodextrins as well as nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners). The end products
of the 




-amylase hydrolysis of starch are maltodextrins, which are not sweet and are not used as sweeteners in food, as well
as nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners. Maltodextrins may be used as a food ingredient or used as a raw material in the
manufacture of nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, for example, glucose syrups. Therefore, FDA finds that the phrase
``production of maltodextrins and nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners from starch'' is a more accurate description
of the petitioned food use of 




-amylase enzyme preparation. FDA is publishing this document as a tentative final rule to afford interested persons
the opportunity to comment on this change. To avoid confusion between 




-amylase, the enzyme, and 




-amylase, the enzyme preparation (in which 




-amylase is the principal active component, but which also contains other components derived from the production
organism or the fermentation media), this document will use the term ``




-amylase'' to refer to the former and ``




-amylase enzyme preparation'' to refer to the latter.


II. Standards for GRAS Affirmation


Pursuant to 170.30 (21 CFR 170.30), general recognition of safety may be based only on the views of experts qualified
by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of substances. The basis of such views may be either:
(1) Scientific procedures, or (2) in the case of a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, experience based
on common use in food. General recognition of safety based upon scientific procedures requires the same quantity
and quality of scientific evidence as is required to obtain approval of a food additive regulation and ordinarily
is to be based upon published studies, which may be corroborated by unpublished studies and other data and information
(170.30(b)). General recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food prior to January
1, 1958, may be determined without the quantity or quality of scientific procedures required for approval of a food
additive regulation but ordinarily is to be based upon generally available data and information concerning its pre-1958
use (170.30(c)).


III. Safety Evaluation


A. Introduction
Starch produced in plants exists in two main forms. The linear form is composed of 




-D-glucose sugar residues bonded together with a type of linkage termed 




-1,4 (Ref. 1). This linear form is commonly termed amylose. The other form of starch, termed amylopectin, is composed
of amylose molecules linked together at branch points. In this form, resembling a tree-like structure, the branch
points are formed by a different kind of linkage termed 




-1,6. An 




-amylase enzyme (1,4-




-D glucan glucanohydrolase (International Union of Biochemistry Enzyme Commission (E.C.) 3.2.1.1)) can hydrolyze,
i.e., break, the 




-1,4 linkages found in amylose and amylopectin (Ref. 2). Treatment with 




-amylase enzyme lowers the molecular weight of the starch molecules to form molecules collectively called maltodextrins.


Certain maltodextrins may be subjected to subsequent processing. For instance, corn maltodextrins may be further
hydrolyzed by another enzyme, glucoamylase, to produce glucose (also known as dextrose) which may in turn be isomerized
to form high fructose corn syrups. These corn sweeteners are refined with ion exchange resins to remove impurities
and are then concentrated. The processed corn sweeteners are then used in a wide variety of products in the food industry.
Current technology sometimes requires the 




-amylase enzyme to function at high temperatures, up to 110
&cir; C (Refs. 1 and 3). Therefore, much effort has gone into research on 




-amylases from thermophilic microorganisms such as 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 (Ref. 3).
In evaluating this petition to affirm as GRAS the use of 




-amylase enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 as a food ingredient, the agency considered six aspects of its manufacture and use: (1) The identity of the 




-amylase enzyme component; (2) the identity and safety of the source (production) organism for the 




-amylase enzyme preparation; (3) the manufacturing process of the 




-amylase enzyme preparation; (4) the intended uses for the 




-amylase enzyme preparation in food and exposure to residual levels of the 




-amylase enzyme preparation; (5) the specifications for the formulation of the enzyme preparation; and (6) toxicological
studies of the enzyme preparation.


B. The Enzyme Component


The 




-amylase enzyme from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is extracellular (Ref. 2). That is, the enzyme is secreted by the bacteria into the surrounding media. Data and published
information in the petition confirm that the petitioner's enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 functions in the hydrolysis of starch as an 




-amylase (1,4-




-D glucan glucanohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.1)) (Refs. 4 through 7).
Published data show that the 




-amylase enzyme functions at an optimum temperature of 80
&cir; C and at pH values below 6 (Ref. 7), which is consistent with previous published reports characterizing 




-amylase from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 and other thermophilic Bacillus species (Refs. 2 and 3). The published data further show that the petitioner's enzyme
has a molecular weight of 58 kilodaltons (kd) (Ref. 7) which is consistent with the 58 kd mass reported by Sen (Ref. 8)
and within experimental error of the predicted 61 kd mass based on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence analysis
(Ref. 9). 
The 




-amylases are functionally divided into two categories, saccharifying 




-amylases, which break approximately 40 to 60 percent of the 




-1,4 linkages in a starch, and liquefying 




-amylases, which break only 30 to 40 percent of the linkages in the starch (Ref. 3). The 




-amylase from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is of the liquefying type and is very similar in protein sequence to liquefying 




-amylases from other Bacillus species that have been commonly used in food processing (Refs. 1, 3, and 9 through 12),
for example, 

Bacillus

 

amyloliquefaciens

 (Ref. 1) and 

Bacillus

 

licheniformis

 (see 21 CFR 184.1027). 


C. The Production Organism


The source organism for this enzyme preparation is the bacterium 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

. The petition includes data to show that the strain used by the petitioner, 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 (AS154), conforms to the description of 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 in ``Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology,'' 8th ed. (Ref. 13), which is a standard compendium for the taxonomy
of bacteria. The petition also contains data to show that this strain of 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is an asporogenic variant and does not produce antibiotics or toxins.
Published scientific literature as well as standard textbooks on food microbiology demonstrate that 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 and its spores are widely distributed in nature and they are commonly found in fresh foods (Refs. 13 and 14). 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is also reported to be the typical organism causing nontoxic sour spoilage in low acid foods (Ref. 14). 
The petition contains one published pathogenicity study that demonstrated that 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is not pathogenic (Ref. 15). The petition also contains an extensive search of the published literature from 1917
to 1992 involving over 1,700 references and citations relating to 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 concerning pathogenicity, pathogen formation, toxicology and toxins, and disease or infection. The search failed
to disclose a single report that implicated 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 as the etiologic agent of a disease state in man or animals. There were no reports of any toxicity or pathogenicity associated
with the presence of this organism in food.


D. The Manufacturing Process


The 




-amylase enzymes of Bacillus are extracellular enzymes (Ref. 10). Therefore, the manufacturing procedures follow
those generally used in the enzyme industry to separate and concentrate extracellular enzymes (Ref. 16). Under the
method of manufacture of 




-amylase enzyme preparation described in the petition, 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is maintained as a pure culture under conditions that minimize any genetic changes and is grown in a pure culture fermentation.
When fermentation is complete, the broth is clarified by treating it with calcium hydroxide, and cells are removed
from the broth by filtration using a diatomaceous earth filter aid (Ref. 17). The filtered, clarified broth containing
the soluble enzyme is then ultrafiltered to remove all particulate matter. The filtrate, containing the 




-amylase enzyme, is then evaporated to a concentrate of the desired enzyme potency, usually about a three-fold concentration.
Sodium chloride is added to the concentrate so that the final salt concentration is 20 percent by weight of the enzyme
preparation. Data submitted in the petition show that the enzyme preparation produced by this method of manufacture
does not contain any viable bacterial cells. 
FDA finds that the manufacturing method does not require the use of any processing materials that are not GRAS or approved
food additives. Therefore, the agency concludes that the manufacturing steps will not introduce impurities into
the enzyme preparation that will adversely affect the safety of the preparation.


E. Estimated Exposure Levels


The amount of the enzyme preparation used will vary based on the catalytic activity of the enzyme in any particular
batch of enzyme preparation. Estimates of enzyme use level and intake are usually based on the total organic solids
(TOS) content of the enzyme preparation (Ref. 18). TOS is the sum of all organic compounds present in the final enzyme
preparation, excluding diluents or carriers, if added. TOS is calculated as follows: TOS percent=100-(A+W+D) where
A is the percent of ash, W is the percent of water, and D is the percent of diluents or carriers. 
FDA's estimate of exposure to 




-amylase enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is based on the food use of maltodextrins and nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners, data for general usage of 




-amylase preparations, and the relative enzymatic potency of this particular enzyme preparation compared to typical
preparations. FDA calculates that the intake of typical 




-amylase enzyme preparations reported as TOS is 25 milligrams (mg) TOS per person per day (TOS/person/day). The subject
preparation has an enzymatic potency about six-fold higher than typical preparations; therefore, the estimated
daily intake (EDI) is one-sixth of 25 mg or about 4 mg/TOS/person/day, or 67 micrograms (&mu;g)/kilograms (kg) body
weight/day for a 60 kg person.


F. Enzyme Preparation Specifications


The petition contains data showing that the 




-amylase enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 produced in this manner meets the general and additional requirements for enzyme preparations in the ``Food Chemicals
Codex,'' 3d ed. (Ref. 19).


G. Safety of Enzyme Preparation 


The petition contains published animal feeding studies to support the safety of the enzyme preparation. These include
a 90-day subchronic oral toxicity study in dogs and a 90-day subchronic oral toxicity study in F1 rats exposed in utero.
No adverse treatment-related effects were identified in the 90-day studies (Ref. 20).
The petition also contained several unpublished, corroborative safety studies. These animal feeding studies of
the 




-amylase enzyme preparation included an acute oral toxicity study in rats and 14-day palatability studies in both
rats and dogs. None of these studies demonstrated any adverse 
treatment-related effects. 
Based upon the 90-day dog study, FDA estimated an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 377 &mu;g/kg body weight, which
is 1/1000 of the highest no-effect level (377 mg/kg body weight, which was the highest dose tested). These studies
show that the ADI for the enzyme preparation (377 &mu;g/kg body weight/day) exceeds the EDI for uses of this enzyme
preparation (67 &mu;g/kg body weight/day).


IV. Conclusions 


The petition requested affirmation of GRAS status of 




-amylase preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 based on its similarity to other 




-amylase enzyme preparations that have a history of common use in food prior to 1958. The petition cites data that report
that 




-amylase enzyme preparation from B. subtilis has been used commercially since 1929, when it was used in the manufacture
of chocolate syrup to reduce its viscosity (Ref. 21). The petition stated that bacterial 




-amylase enzyme preparations were first described in the preparation of corn sweeteners in 1962, but that common
use of these enzymes by major food processors did not occur until some time later. The petition also stated that today,
corn sweeteners prepared with bacterial amylase enzyme preparations are used in nearly all commercially prepared
foods.
The agency evaluated the petition using the criteria of 170.30(c) and concluded that although 




-amylase enzyme preparations have had a long history of use before 1958, the data provided no evidence for history
of use of 




-amylase enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

, and that based on the data in the petition, this preparation is not eligible for GRAS affirmation based on history
of common use in food. However, the agency has also evaluated the petition using the criteria of 170.30(b) and
concludes that 





-amylase enzyme preparation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 is eligible for GRAS affirmation based on scientific procedures.
The agency has evaluated the information in the petition along with other available information and concludes, based
on evaluation of published information, corroborated by unpublished data and information, that use of the 




-amylase enzyme preparation derived by fermentation from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

 to hydrolyze starch to produce maltodextrins and nutritive carbohydrate sweeteners is GRAS. Furthermore, the data
show no basis for a potential risk from any use of this 




-amylase preparation that can be anticipated. Therefore, the agency is tentatively affirming that the use of the
enzyme is GRAS with no limits other than current good manufacturing conditions in accordance with 21 CFR 184.1(b)(1).

The agency further finds that because the principal active ingredient of the 




-amylase enzyme preparation is safe and because expected impurities in the 




-amylase enzyme preparation do not provide any basis for a safety concern that the general and additional requirements
given for enzyme preparations in the ``Food Chemicals Codex,'' 3d ed. (1981), pp. 107-110, are adequate for defining
minimum criteria for a food-grade 




-amylase enzyme preparation derived from 

B

. 

stearothermophilus

.


V. Environmental Effects


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(b)(7) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.


VI. Analysis of Impacts


FDA has examined the impacts of the tentative final rule under Executive Order 12866, and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (Pub. L. 96354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this tentative final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles
identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the tentative final rule is not a significant regulatory action as
defined by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order. 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Because no current activity is prohibited by this tentative final rule, the compliance
cost to firms is zero. Because no increase in the health risks faced by consumers will result from this tentative final
rule, total costs are also zero. Potential benefits include the wider use of this enzyme because of reduced uncertainty
concerning its GRAS status, and any resources saved by eliminating the need to prepare further petitions to affirm
the GRAS status of this enzyme for this use. The agency certifies, therefore, that the tentative final rule will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, no further analysis is required.
