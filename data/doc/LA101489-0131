THE ACTOR AND HIS GOD/KING; 
FAITH: RICHARD GERE LENDS HIS SUPPORT TO THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE-WINNING DALAI 
LAMA'S 'PILGRIMAGE FOR ACTIVE PEACE.' 
Witness the Buddhist blessing of the mountain: monks chanting, shrill Tibetan 
horns splitting the quiet morning with peals of goose-like blats and green 
juniper branches burning with a sweet, white pungent smoke that dissolves into 
the blue skies above San Francisco. 
It was a perfect setting for mantra to meet media, bodhisattva to meet show biz 
and the Dalai Lama to meet the movie actor. 
Richard Gere, the Buddhist, sat quietly in his three-piece suit, as gray and 
inconspicuous as his perfectly coiffed hair. He went unrecognized by the dozens 
of reporters on hand for the Dalai Lama's first Lhasang, or mountain blessing, 
since the Tibetan god/king won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize 10 days ago. 
While reporters raced up and down the aisles, straining for celebrities to 
interview, the celebrated star of "An Officer and a Gentleman," "American 
Gigolo" and a half-dozen other movies that touched on the rough-hewn 
situational ethics that characterized much of the 1980s, shut his eyes behind a 
pair of eyeglasses. Gere's personal publicist and several other members of his 
entourage sat alongside him, where he was joined by an invited Times reporter 
-- ninth row back behind the press corps and 10 yards from the stage where the 
hourlong tea-and-meditation ceremony took place. 
But nary a microphone was stuck in his face. Gere didn't mind. He didn't come 
seeking exposure. His hands were clasped together in prayer throughout most of 
the ritual. 
The media did find beat poet Allen Ginsberg ("That's A-L-L-E-N and 'berg' with 
an 'e,' not a 'u,' " Ginsberg told a pair of reporters) and LSD guru Richard 
(Baba Ram Dass) Alpert ("Dass is spelled with two 's'es," Alpert explained to a 
photographer scribbling down his name). 
Maybe it was the glasses or the stockbroker's suit or the premature silver in 
his naturally curly locks. But, for some reason, one of the Dalai Lama's 
biggest and best-known fans went undetected by the roving TV crews who wanted 
to know how the Nobel laureate beat out the other Nobel nominees, where he was 
going next on his whirlwind, worldwide "Pilgrimage for Active Peace" and what 
he was going to buy with his $469,000 in Peace Prize money. 
Gere listened with quiet tolerance. To him, the 54-year-old Dalai Lama is 
addressed only as "His Holiness" and such questions completely missed the 
point. 
But Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama in a line dating back six centuries, 
seemed mildly bemused by it all. He giggled as he answered the press, speaking 
of love and compassion and something Gere knows about firsthand: promotion. 
"How to promote love and compassion is the thing," the exiled god/king of Tibet 
told the curious army of journalists. "Education, this is the thing. I have no 
such qualifications (to be such an educator/promoter). I am a simple Buddhist 
monk." 
Perhaps the little man in saffron and maroon robes was simple. Perhaps he was 
unacquainted with the ways of promotion and publicity. But he took full 
advantage of the hoards of minicams and shotgun microphones aimed at him 
Tuesday during the first U.S. stop in his "Pilgrimage for Active Peace," 
organized by Buddhist leader Tai Situpa XII. (On Sunday, this leg of the Dalai 
Lama's pilgrimage will end with a similar mountaintop ceremony at Mt. Shasta, 
200 miles northeast of San Francisco.) 
When a handful of cynics sang "Hello Dalai" to the tune of "Hello, Dolly!" upon 
his arrival by helicopter for the Lhasang ceremony, the pacific grin never left 
the Nobel laureate's face. When an NBC cameraman stepped on the sacrosanct red 
carpet leading from the Dalai Lama's helicopter pad to the Lhasang ceremonial 
site, the Buddhist leader's advance men got much more worked up about the faux 
pas than the god/king himself. 
"It is best to be an optimist because, if you are a pessimist, you will only be 
depressed and no one wants this depression," he said in one of many homilies he 
punctuated with the tinkle of his trademark laughter. 
Since his elevation by the Nobel Committee and, subsequently, the media, to the 
instant international status of Peace Prize winner, he has become a very 
different kind of god/king. Like it or not, the Dalai Lama is now a media hero. 
And the perennially smiling prelate from Tibet seems to like it. He has lost no 
opportunity during the last week to promote his favorite subject: freeing his 2 
million countrymen from 40 years of Chinese rule. 
And Gere, who normally spurns the press, says that he stands ready to help him 
do it. 
"The Chinese have acted like barbarians," he said flatly. 
After more than a year without a movie in release, Gere is coming out in two 
starring roles this winter: "3000," a Pygmalion-type tale directed by Garry 
("Happy Days") Marshall for Touchstone, and "Internal Affairs," a cop drama for 
Paramount. 
But he really doesn't care to talk about either one very much. That's something 
he does for money and career and the Hollywood machine with which he made a 
Faustian deal more than a decade ago. A man who rarely does interviews, Gere 
cringes at the thought of making the talk show rounds or submitting himself to 
gossip columnists. It isn't that he doesn't know how to promote his films. In 
an odd show-biz paradox that smacks of Zen, his well-known refusal to publicize 
often creates its own publicity. On the way to not talking about this movie or 
that movie, he talks instead about promoting something he considers more 
worthwhile, like the religious philosophy of the Dalai Lama. The movie winds up 
with a plug, but almost by default. 
"One is required to explore everything that is being said as one tests a 
precious metal to find out if it's real," he said, offering a quick course in 
the Eastern religion that he took up 10 years ago, after his first visit to 
Nepal. "There's a very deep and strict philosophical and logical basis to the 
system that this extraordinary man, Gotama Buddha, came up with." 
When he agreed to take a break from filming at Disney studios and accompany the 
new Nobel laureate on his pilgrimage, Gere had planned to use his celebrity to 
help the Dalai Lama past the worst of the predatory press. It would not have 
been the first time the actor has sought out "quality" publicity for his 
causes. 
He is an outspoken critic of U.S. foreign policy in Central America and an 
active environmentalist. His chief cause remains the freeing of Tibet, however. 
Two years ago, he helped establish Tibet House in New York -- a museum and 
research facility dedicated to promoting Tibetan culture sanctioned by the 
Dalai Lama. 
But the "simple Buddhist monk," as the Tibetan leader calls himself, seems to 
have learned the lessons of promotion in Western culture as well as Gere. If 
the Dalai Lama is unsophisticated, it is the simpleness of the late Sen. Sam 
Ervin, who liked to characterize himself as a "simple country lawyer." 
After the Lhamansa ceremony atop Mt. Tamalpais, Gere joined the Dalai Lama in 
one of the helicopters heading for the Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill, 30 miles to 
the south. 
After the Dalai Lama delivered a noontime speech at the hotel, Gere agreed to 
emerge from anonymity and do what he rarely does: join in a press conference. 
But that was before the Dalai Lama hammed it up a bit for the Western press. He 
flew in helicopters. He laughed his disarming, infectious laugh. He donned a 
tennis hat to keep the sun off his shaven skull and waved happily to the 
predatory press. 
"Gee, he's cute!" remarked one veteran photographer. 
So when the Dalai Lama chuckled, finessed and breezed his way through the press 
conference without inviting Gere to the dais, the Dalai Lama's own public 
relations firm, Daniel J. Edelman Inc., thought there might be some hurt 
feelings. 
"Gosh, Richard, I hope you don't mind not being up there," said Edelman account 
supervisor Mara Brazer. "We were going to bring you up but he just. . . ." 
Gere bowed slightly and waved off the rest of her sentence with his hand. He 
smiled as enigmatically, if not as broadly, as the Dalai Lama. 
"It's all right," he said. "I am here to serve."
