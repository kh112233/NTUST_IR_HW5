P.M. BRIEFING; 
FDA OKS POULTRY IRRADIATION 
The Food and Drug Administration today approved treating chicken and other 
poultry with radiation to control microbes that can cause food poisoning. 
FDA officials emphasized that the irradiation process does not pose a health 
threat to consumers because it does not make the poultry radioactive. 
In a notice to be published Wednesday in the Federal Register, the FDA said it 
has determined that the use of gamma radiation, electron radiation and X-rays 
to treat chicken, turkey and other fresh or frozen, uncooked poultry is safe at 
the levels being approved.
