WORLD IN BRIEF; 
JAPAN; 
WORLD'S BIGGEST USER OF IVORY ACCEPTS BAN 
Japan, the world's largest consumer of ivory, agreed to abide by an 
international ban on ivory imports, a move seen as vital to the effort to save 
the African elephant from extinction. The announcement came on the last day of 
a two-week conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, of CITES, the French acronym 
for the International Convention on Trade in Endangered Species. A ban could 
never be effective without Japan, a CITES spokesman said, since that country 
"accounts for around 40% of world imports of ivory." Some conservationists 
estimate that the number of African elephants has been halved in the past 
decade, plunging from around 1.3 million to the 625,000 mark.
