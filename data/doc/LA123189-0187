TERM LIMITS FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS 
Your editorial is marching to a different drummer. The majority of the public 
did not elect officials for life so that they could pocket perks, pensions and 
personal mistresses. 
As a lifelong Republican, many of my associates agree with Atty. Gen. John Van 
de Kamp that two-term limits are a necessity. We will vote "yes" for this 
nonpartisan issue. 
Two terms was good enough for the founding fathers, and it should be good 
enough for today's politicians.
