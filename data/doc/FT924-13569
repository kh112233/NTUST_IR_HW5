FT  15 OCT 92 / Germany wants EC summit to discuss future of European
integration
Germany wants tomorrow's European Community emergency summit, called to
discuss the future of European integration, to consider new international
aid for war refugees in former Yugoslavia, Reuter reports.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, concerned about a growing racist backlash against up
to 300,000 refugees now in Germany, will urge the EC to earmark more funds
to help house and feed Bosnian refugees in Croatia, Bonn officials said.
Turkey will send about 20,000 tonnes of fuel oil to Bosnia, to help people
face winter conditions under the Serbian siege, the foreign ministry said in
Ankara. It will also set up a 50-bed hospital in Bosnia for victims of the
war, once security could be assured.
