DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUPLE DIES WHEN CAR CAREENS OFF FREEWAY 
A car went out of control and rolled down a 70-foot freeway embankment south of 
Palmdale Sunday night, killing a man and woman, the California Highway Patrol 
reported Monday. 
Authorities were unaware of the accident until Monday afternoon, when the 
wreckage was sighted in thick brush east of the Antelope Valley Freeway near 
the Pearblossom Highway off-ramp, officials said. The crash apparently occurred 
at 8:54 p.m. Sunday -- the time and day on the dead driver's watch, which was 
broken in the accident, Officer Ruben DeAvila said. 
The names of the victims, both Lancaster residents, were withheld until 
relatives could be notified. The driver, a man about 36 years old, and the 
44-year-old female passenger apparently died instantly, DeAvila said. 
Investigators determined that the driver drifted into the dirt-covered center 
while headed north on the freeway and lost control, with the car rebounding 
onto the freeway at a 45-degree angle. It went over the side of the freeway, 
became airborne and flipped end-over-end upon landing, coming to rest on its 
wheels, DeAvila said.
