FT  04 MAY 94 / World News in Brief: Children and Red Cross staff die in
Rwanda massacre
Twenty-one children and 13 Red Cross volunteers were killed in an attack on
an orphanage at Butare, southern Rwanda, the International Committee of the
Red Cross said yesterday. The children had been moved from the capital
Kigali because it was believed they would be safer at the orphanage. United
Nations officials and the Red Cross say more than 100,000 people have been
massacred in Rwanda since the tribal killings began four weeks ago. US steps
