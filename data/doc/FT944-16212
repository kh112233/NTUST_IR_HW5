FT  14 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Misguided assistance
Sir, Your report of the Taiwanese stock market controversy ('Minister to
answer to Hualon inquiry', October 12), with which the Hualon Corporation
has been associated, has again focused attention on the proposed investment
by this company in a new textile plant in Northern Ireland.
We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that the principal objections
of the European textile industry to the investment lie in the provision of
Pounds 61m of assistance by the UK government to build a new plant in a
sector in which there is already an excess manufacturing capacity within the
EU.
The industry has also voiced concern that the estimated number of jobs to be
created by the investment is unsubstantiated by the information which has
been publicly disclosed; furthermore, any benefit to Northern Ireland in
employment terms is likely to be at the expense of jobs in other parts of
the UK.
Surely, in the light of these objections and the expected investigations by
the Taiwanese authorities, the government should reconsider its support for
the project, which is opposed by such a wide spectrum of textile interests,
both in the UK and throughout the European Union.
Meantime, the European textile industry is preparing its appeal to the
European Court of Justice.
