  [Text] Majuro, April 12 (AFP) - President Amata Kabua 
reshuffled his cabinet Tuesday, replacing his veteran foreign 
minister, Tom Kijiner. 
  Kabua announced the changes without any comment, saying that 
Kijiner would immediately become minister of health and 
environment while the existing education minister, Phillip 
Muller, becomes the new foreign minister. Evelyn Konou leaves 
health to take over education. 
  Kijiner has been foreign minister since 1988 and presided 
over a period of tremendous diplomatic activity as the country 
moved from US control into independence. He opened missions at 
the United Nations, Fiji, China and Japan as well as consulates 
in California and Hong Kong. 
  Muller has been education minister since 1986 and has played 
a key role in revamping the ailing public school system with 8 
million US dollars from the Asian Development Bank. 
  Konou, the only woman in parliament, has been health 
minister 
since last year.
