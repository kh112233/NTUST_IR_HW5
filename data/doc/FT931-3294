FT  16 MAR 93 / International Company News: Eli Lilly surprises with profit
warning
ELI LILLY, the large US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday said its
first-quarter earnings per share could fall as much as 20.5 per cent before
accounting changes, reflecting slower sales of several important drugs.
Mr James Cornelius, Lilly's chief financial officer, said the company
expected first-quarter earnings, excluding accounting changes, to fall in a
range of Dollars 1.20 to Dollars 1.30 a share, compared with Dollars 1.51 a
year earlier. In the 1992 quarter, Lilly's results benefited significantly
from the sale of its capsule business.
Mr Cornelius blamed the disappointing outlook on slow sales of
anti-infectives because of a relatively mild flu season and increased
competition in the US and western Europe. The company's medical devices and
diagnostics division has also seen sales slide.
Mr Viren Mehta, partner at analysts Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York said: 'Until
recently, it was unheard of to see earnings declines in the pharmaceuticals
industry but we are seeing significant changes in the industry now.'
In addition to concern about drug pricing which has plagued the industry in
recent months, Lilly's performance has been hurt by pressure on sales of its
leading Prozac anti-depressant and the absence of important new drugs in the
pipeline.
On Wall Street, shares in Lilly closed down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 51 3/8 .
The announcement came after the close in New York.
General Mills, the US consumer foods producer and restaurant chain operator
which reported record earnings in the third quarter, expects full-year 1993
to bring record sales, earnings and earnings per share, Reuter reports from
Minneapolis.
In the third quarter ending February 28, General Mills had net income of
Dollars 140.9m, or 86 cents a share, against Dollars 132.1m, or 80 cents, a
year earlier. Sales rose to Dollars 2.01bn from Dollars 1.90bn.
