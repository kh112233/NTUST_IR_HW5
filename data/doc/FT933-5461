FT  03 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Trials
on malaria drug show promise
A BITE of iron may be the answer to drug-resistant malaria, the British
Association meeting heard yesterday, Clive Cookson writes.
Professor Robert Hider of King's College, London, described an experimental
new class of anti-malarial drugs called 'iron chelators'. They work by
biting the iron atom out of a vital enzyme in the malaria parasite.
One candidate drug developed by Prof Hider and colleagues has undergone
successful animal trials and is being tested for toxicity before human
trials begin.
Malaria is becoming a more serious health problem worldwide as the parasite
evolves to resist existing drugs. More than 100m people are affected every
year and an estimated 2m die, making malaria the world's second-biggest
infectious killer after tuberculosis.
'A new strategy is needed urgently,' Prof Hider said. His candidate drug
could be taken by mouth for a relatively short period after infection.
It is a simple chemical and, if clinical trials are successful, it could
probably be produced cheaply for use in poorer tropical countries.
