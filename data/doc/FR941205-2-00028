Recombinant Vaccinia Virus Encoding Cytochromes P450 


Gelboin, H.V., Battula, N., Gonzalez, F.J., Moss, B. (NCI, NIAID) 
Serial No. 07/787,777 filed 6 Nov 91 
U.S. Patent 5,164,313 issued 17 Nov 92 
Serial No. 08/166,287 
Filed 13 Dec 93 [FWC of 07/930,781 (Aban), which is DIV of 
07/787,777]

 

This invention describes the construction and uses of 
recombinant vaccinia viruses containing DNA sequences that 
express enzymatically active cytochromes P1450 and P3450 in 
mammalian cells without requiring the extraneous addition of 
NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase or cell fractions for catalytic 
activity. This novel recombinant virus can be used to evaluate 
the cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism and mutagenicity of 
xenobiotic or endobiotic compounds and chemical agents. The 
invention represents the first expression of cytochrome P450 in 
a variety of mammalian systems using infectious viruses.
