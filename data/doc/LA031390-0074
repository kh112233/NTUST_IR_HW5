JAPAN TV STATION BUYS TON OF BERLIN WALL PIECES 
A Japanese television station has bought about 2,200 pounds of rubble from the 
Berlin Wall. 
Tokai TV Broadcasting in the city of Nagoya said it took delivery of the wall 
fragments Monday after striking a deal with an unidentified group of East 
Germans. 
The fragments are to form part of a studio display for a current affairs 
program.
