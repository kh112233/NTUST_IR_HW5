  [Summary] A survey report conducted by a team led by Zhang 
Zhefu on "Lyme Disease Etiology and Epidemiology" reveals that 
5.33 percent of the surveyed 25,795 population who live in the 
wooded areas of 19 provinces, autonomous regions and cities 
directly governed by the Central Government, are infected with 
Lyme disease, and in some severely-infected areas infection rate 
is even much higher, from 11.28 percent to 18.91 percent. 
Average morbidity rate for the surveyed population is from 1 
percent to 4.5 percent, but it reaches up to 9 percent in 
severely-infected areas. Since 1985, the team has focused its 
study on Lyme disease epidemiology, etiology, vectors, host 
animals and the disease's clinical symptoms. The team isolated 
83 Lyme disease spirochetes from patients, host animals and 
ticks, and found that spirochetes isolated in China are 
different in their structural patterns from those isolated in 
Western countries. The team also identified the natural epidemic 
focuses in 12 provinces.
