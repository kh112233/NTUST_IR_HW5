  [Text] At 1500 on 12 April the Serbian police at the 
border point of Qafe Morine held Adeleide Filket Timer, chief of 
the Albanian section of the German Radio Deutsche Welle, and the 
radio's correspondent in Tirana, Dr. Apollon Bace, who is a 
member of the Albanian Journalists League, for seven hours. 
They were in Yugoslavia and the German journalist had a special 
reporter's visa. 
  Three persons who arrived from the center interrogated the 
journalists and set them free at midnight, even though Mrs. 
Timer is at an advance stage of pregnancy. The Serbian police 
sequestered all the tapes with interviews of Albanian 
personalities in Kosova and Montenegro, books, even personal 
cards and money. One of the policemen told the reporters: I 
would have sent you to prison if those from the center had not 
released you. 
  The Albanian Journalists League protests this act of 
banditry 
of the Serbian police forces and appeals to international 
organizations to increase the pressure against the Belgrade 
regime to stop the maltreatment of journalists.
