DIGEST: LONG BEACH; 
VOTE CONFIRMS DENIAL OF OFFICERS' LEGAL DEFENSE 
By a 6-3 vote, the City Council voted this week not to pay for the legal 
defense of two Long Beach police officers facing misdemeanor criminal charges 
in their arrest of anti-brutality activist Don Jackson. 
The vote confirms a decision made by the council in closed session last week. 
Although the city has in the past paid for the criminal defense of police 
officers, council members said they were not prepared at this time to pick up 
the legal tab for officers Mark Dickey and Mark Ramsey. The council noted that 
an investigation of the officers is pending. 
Dickey and Ramsey have been charged with falsifying their arrest report on 
Jackson, and Dickey has also been charged with assaulting the activist, who was 
stopped by the officers during a sting operation secretly filmed by a 
television crew. On the videotape, which was nationally broadcast, Dickey 
appears to push Jackson into a plate glass window, which shattered. 
Councilmen Warren Harwood, Wallace Edgerton and Jeffrey A. Kellogg all voted to 
pay for the officers' legal defense. "It's a matter of providing a defense for 
an employee charged in an act of duty," Harwood said later. 
Becky Bishop, the wife of a Long Beach police officer, presented the council 
with a petition signed by more than 200 residents urging the city to defend the 
pair. "What kind of message is this going to give police officers?" she asked 
after the council vote.
