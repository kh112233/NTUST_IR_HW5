  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (AFP)--Five foreign journalists 
were briefly held and questioned by Chinese police Friday when 
they tried to visit the wife of detained dissident Xu Wenli. 
  A dozen policemen stopped the journalists as they arrived 
Friday afternoon at Kang Tong's housing compound, one of the 
foreigners said. The group included the correspondent of Hong 
Kong's SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST Geoffrey Crothall, Barbara 
Alighiero of Italy's ANSA, David Schlesinger of REUTERS and 
German correspondents Henrik Bork of FRANKFURTER RUNDSHAU and 
Andreas Landwehr of DPA. 
  When Kang arrived to speak with them she was dragged away 
and 
the journalists were taken for questioning to a small room next 
to the compound entrance where their press passes were briefly 
confiscated, the journalists said. "We could have left at any 
time but it would been without our press passes," one said. 
  The police made several phone calls before returning the 
press cards and allowing the journalists to leave after about 30 
minutes, he added. 
  Xu, a leader of the 1978-1979 Democracy Wall movement and 
one 
of China's longest serving political prisoners, was taken from 
his home early Friday, Kang said by telephone earlier. 
  The 49-year-old dissident had been released from prison on 
parole last year after serving 12 years of a 15-year sentence 
for "counter-revolutionary" crimes. 
  The former electrician has since maintained a low profile 
and 
not been involved in any open dissident activity.
