  [Text] Groznny January 11 TASS -- Georgian Leader Eduard 
Shevardnadze will have an official meeting with maverick 
president Dzhokhar Dudayev of the self-styled Russian republic 
of Chechnya, the CHECHENPRESS news agency reported on Tuesday 
quoting Chechen Foreign Minister Shamseddin Yusef. 
  The news agency did not provide the date and venue of the 
meeting, but said an agreement on friendship and cooperation 
between neighbouring Georgia and Chechnya is expected to be 
signed. 
  According to Yusef, the meeting was agreed during a recent 
visit of the Chechen government delegation to Tbilisi. 
  The announcement came shortly after it became known that 
ex-President of Georgia Zviad Gamsakhurdia, an irreconcilable 
opponent of Shevardnadze, is dead. Chechnya was the shelter for 
Gamsakhurdia for two years of his exile from where he commanded 
the anti-Shevardnadze struggle in western Georgia. The late 
Gamsakhurdia who reportedly committed a suicide will most 
evidently be buried in Chechnya, according to the will of his 
widow.
