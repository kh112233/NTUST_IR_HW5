ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
CUT, UNCUT: If a federal budget isn't agreed upon by Oct. 1, the FAA plans to 
furlough air traffic controllers and cancel thousands of flights a day at 40 
major airports. John Wayne was on that list until Thursday, but the FAA decided 
it could handle normal traffic there, even with furloughs. . . . Look for big 
cuts at LAX, however. If furloughs are ordered, controllers could handle only 
57% of peak-hours traffic. Cathy Curtis and Bob Schwartz
