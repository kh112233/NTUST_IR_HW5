WORLD IN BRIEF; 
LEBANON; 
THIRD ANNIVERSARY FOR HOSTAGE WAITE 
Anglican envoy Terry Waite begins today his fourth year as a hostage of 
pro-Iranian Shiite Muslim militants with his fate, and those of other captives, 
apparently hinging on a power struggle in Tehran. 
A reliable Shiite source, who is familiar with the thinking of the 
hostage-holding factions, said the issue of the 18 Westerners missing in 
Lebanon is "on the back burner" until Iran's political infighting is settled. 
Waite, 50, disappeared in Muslim West Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987. He was last seen 
leaving his seaside hotel to keep a rendezvous with kidnapers holding two 
Americans -- journalist Terry Anderson and Scottish-born educator Thomas 
Sutherland -- to negotiate their release.
