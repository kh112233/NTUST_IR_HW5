ACTION: 

Notice of proposed amendments to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (evaluation of Lake Pend Oreille
Lake levels).






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Pursuant to the Pacific Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (the Northwest Power Act, 16 U.S.C. section
839, et seq.) the Pacific Northwest Electric Power and Conservation Planning Council (Council) has proposed amendments
to the Columbia River Basin Fish and Wildlife Program (program) calling for an evaluation of the effect of lake levels
and other factors on kokanee salmon in Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho. Copies of the proposed amendments, together with
a proposed scope of work for the evaluation are available and comments are solicited.




BACKGROUND: 

The proposed amendments are intended to facilitate investigation of the relationship between water levels in Lake
Pend Oreille and the health of kokanee salmon, which appears to have declined since the time that the Lake began to be
deeply drafted for power production and other purposes. The effect of factors such as tributary habitat production
potential, lake productivity and predator abundance would also be investigated. The evaluation is expected to take
5 years, and would constrain certain operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System.




OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMENT: 

The Council will receive written comment on the proposed amendments through 5 p.m. Pacific time, June 17, 1994. Comments
should be clearly marked ``Lake Pend Oreille Comments,'' and submitted to the Council's Public Affairs Division,
851 SW. Sixth Avenue, suite 1100, Portland, Oregon 97204. After the close of comment, the Council may initiate further
consultations, or reopen the record for further written comment before making a final decision. A final decision
is expected to be made in July 1994. HEARINGS: The Council is in the process of scheduling hearings in the four Northwest
states. Please call the Council's public affairs division for information on the schedule and location for hearings,
and watch for further information in the Council's newsletter, Update. To reserve a time to testify at a hearing, please
call Ms. Judi Hertz at 18002223355 (if calling from Idaho, Montana or Washington), 18004522324
(if calling from Oregon), or 2225161 (if calling from the Portland area).



Please contact the Council's Public Affairs Division to reserve a time to testify. Witnesses should be prepared to
summarize briefly, rather than read, any written statement they wish to enter into the record.
