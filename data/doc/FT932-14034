FT  21 APR 93 / David Thomas prize
THE 1993 David Thomas Prize was presented to Mr Nicholas Clegg at a ceremony
at the Financial Times's London headquarters last night by Ms Jenny Rossiter
(both pictured left), who chairs the trustees.
The prize was established in memory of David Thomas, the Financial Times
journalist killed on assignment in Kuwait in April 1991 together with Alan
Harper, a Financial Times photographer in whose memory a photographic
bursary has been established.
Candidates for the 1993 prize wrote on the topic 'What are the limits to
privatisation' and submitted a proposal on how they would use the Pounds
2,000 award. Mr Clegg, a political consultant aged 26, will travel to
Hungary to examine the impact of foreign ownership on Hungarian industry,
and popular reactions to it. He will also research the course of
privatisation in the Czech Republic and Poland.
The 1992 prize, whose theme had an environmental bias, was won by Dr Olga
Speranskaya, a Moscow ecologist.
