FT  06 SEP 93 / GM-VW dispute under fire
THE HEADS of two German car companies at the weekend criticised the public
row between rivals Volkswagen and US-based General Motors over alleged
industrial espionage as being damaging to the industry generally, Reuter
reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, chairman of BMW, told Die Welt newspaper: 'There is
much more at stake than a loss of image for the automotive industry.
Industry leaders in general are coming under fire.'
Separately, Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, chairman of German luxury sports car
maker Porsche, criticised the public nature of the VW-GM dispute.
'It would be better for the whole of the automotive industry if the dispute
between VW and Opel had remained in internal channels and not been fought in
public,' Mr Wiedeking told the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper on Saturday.
GM and its German subsidiary Adam Opel have accused Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua, VW's production chief, and other former GM managers of taking
confidential documents from the US group when they switched to VW this year.
Mr Lopez and the others deny the charges.
