FT  23 SEP 93 / IDA contribution withheld: World economic outlook
A KEY congressional committee has withheld full authorisation for the
Dollars 3.75bn (Pounds 2.43bn) US contribution to the International
Development Association, the World Bank unit that provides loans at low
interest rates to the poorest developing countries.
The House of Representatives banking committee voted yesterday to allow the
US to sign the IDA replenishment agreement reached last year, but to
authorise only the first two Dollars 1.25bn tranches of the US contribution.
This limited authorisation follows protracted talks with the US Treasury and
the World Bank over improvements in transparency of bank operations.
Both Treasury and World Bank officials had hoped recent changes in portfolio
management and disclosure policy, as well as the decision to set up an
independent inspection panel, would be enough to win a full three-year
authorisation. But Mr Barney Frank, chairman of the subcommittee overseeing
the World Bank, said there was still uncertainty over how the reforms would
work out.
The bill would also authorise the US to write off developing country debts.
