  [Text] At its most recent session, the Slovak Government 
decided to abolish the former Cabinet resolution refusing any 
alteration of the border with the Czech Republic. It thus 
accepts the original proposal of the two countries' interior 
ministers, who agreed to exchange the Czech settlement of U 
Sabotu in the village of Javornik for a part of Slovak Sidonia 
near Brumov-Bylnice, Zlin district. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus said the following after the government session: 
  [Begin Klaus recording] We know about the Slovak 
Government's 
decision only from the communications media. I asked the 
interior minister to discover precisely the definitive meaning, 
shape, manner, and form of this decision. We would not like to 
do anything hasty on the basis of a very terse report in the 
media. 
  Naturally, if this could untangle the unsatisfactory story 
of 
still-to-be-resolved border problems, we would be very glad, but 
let us see the decision of the Slovak Government. [end recording]
