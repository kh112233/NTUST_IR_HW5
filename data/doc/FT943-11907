FT  28 JUL 94 / 'PVC cartel' fines reimposed
The European Commission yesterday reimposed fines on 12 chemical companies
for an alleged plastics price-fixing cartel during the early 1980s. This
follows a decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg last June
to overturn fines previously imposed to punish a cartel in polyvinyl
chloride (PVC). The court threw out the fines because of translation
differences between the German, English and French texts of the Commission's
decision on the cartel. The textual differences invalidated the entire legal
process, the court said.
The Commission has reimposed fines totalling Ecu23.5m (Pounds 18.5m) against
BASF, Hoechst, Wacker Chemie, and Huls of Germany; ICI and Shell
International Chemical of the UK; DSM of the Netherlands; Limburgse Vinyl
Maatschappij of Belgium; Enichem and Montedison of Italy; and Elf Atochem
and Societe Artesienne de Vinyl of France.
