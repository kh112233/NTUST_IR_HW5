FT  16 NOV 94 / Doctors attack move to local pay
The British Medical Association clashed with the government yesterday over
doctors' and nurses' pay when Dr Sandy Macara, its chairman, wrote to MPs
outlining its opposition to local pay deals.
Dr Macara told MPs that local deals for doctors would be 'a further nail in
the coffin of the idea of the National Health Service, in which doctors work
for the service as a whole and not for individual competing businesses'.
The BMA was reacting to reports that the government had been pressing the
Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body to recommend no national pay rise for
doctors next year but to let hospital trusts strike deals locally. The
confrontation has been building for some time as the review bodies take
evidence for their pay determinations next year.
The BMA is concerned that, given the increasing deficits among a number of
trusts, such a system would lead to some trusts being in a position to pay
more than others.
The government's evidence to the review bodies, put forward this month by Mr
Gerald Malone, the health minister, came as no surprise to NHS staff aware
of ministers' intentions to see locally determined health service pay. The
government argues that any across-the-board recommendations would inhibit
such developments.
Dr Macara called the government's insistence on local pay 'an expensive
distraction to NHS trusts, a divisive force in the NHS and a threat to the
integrity of patient care'.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday affirmed the
government's intention to move towards local agreements. She said: 'It is
clear last year was a transitional year and we will move to more local pay
and that is under way.'
