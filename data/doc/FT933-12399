FT  24 JUL 93 / Progress on Eurotunnel
SIR Alastair Morton, chief executive of Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel
group, yesterday welcomed the decision to grant a large part of east Kent
assisted area status, Andrew Taylor writes.
Sir Alastair is chairman of the East Kent Initiative, a partnership between
private companies, local authorities and enterprise agencies, which has been
lobbying for assistance to increase employment and competitiveness. He said
Thanet had the sixth-highest unemployment rate of all UK
travel-to-work-areas. Sittingbourne and Sheerness the sixteenth-highest.
Dover's unemployment was forecast to rise by 10,000 between 1991 and 1996 as
the ferry industry rationalised and the need for border controls decreased.
The Channel tunnel completion would also lead to job cuts.
Ministers had been convinced that the area needed assistance if it was to
compete with northern France, where large sums of state money have been
spent subsidising development and industry.
