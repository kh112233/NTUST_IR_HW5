report from Sanaa: "Sanaa Accuses al-'Attas of Secessionism"] 
  [Excerpt] Statements made by [Prime Minister] Engineer 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas have greatly upset Sanaa. Observers 
say that the General People's Congress [GPC] has given these 
statements more significance than they deserve and have 
understood them to "mean the removal of President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih" who himself has launched a similar attack on al-'Attas. 
A statement attributed to a GPC information source said that 
al-'Attas is the one "who should be removed." 
  That was a part of Sanaa's violent reaction to press 
statements attributed to the Yemeni prime minister in which he 
said that "there are some political symbols which must be 
removed and actions which must stop if the Yemeni Government is 
to be able to carry out its duties." 
  The GPC statement said that "removal of al-'Attas would be 
in 
the interest of stability in Yemen because he has been an 
obstacle in the way of development projects and in the way of 
the efforts to build a modern Yemeni state since the 
reunification of the homeland on 22 May 1990, and he has 
discharged his duties with a narrow partisan mentality to serve 
selfish and personal interests." It added that he (al-'Attas) 
"is one of the main renegade and secessionist elements in the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and one of those who engineered the 
current political crisis." 
  It should he recalled that al-'Attas had criticized the 
attitude of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his 
interference in government affairs by issuing direct orders to 
ministers and officials and clearly ignoring the prime minister. 
He also addressed a message to him -- unprecedented anywhere in 
the world -- urging him to face his responsibilities as head of 
state on such matters as smuggling and counterfeit foreign and 
Yemeni currency, and to take serious measures against the 
influential figures and centers of power which protect 
terrorists and outlaws. [passage omitted]
