  [Text] Nanning, March 9 (CNS) -- The Guangxi Military 
Region will this year carry out an intensive programme to 
eliminate landmines scattered within the Sino-Vietnamese border 
area covering some 280 districts known as death zones, according 
to the deputy commander of the region, Mr. Hu Jun. 
  The large-scale minesweeping got under way last June in the 
border area between China and Vietnam and has been completed in 
12 ports including Dongxing, Tongzhong, Friendship Pass, and 
Pinxiang as well as at 17 border trade points with 76 
landmine-ridden districts and 118 landmine ranges marked for 
public awareness. A large area was affected by landmines and 
nearly 70,000 landmines of various kinds have been detonated. 
  The military region sent close to 30,000 military personnel 
to carry out minesweeping last year with nearly six tonnes of 
explosives and some 200,000 tonnes of detonators handled without 
incident. An outstanding captain led the minesweeping team on 
100 occasions to wipe out 2,300 landmines last year while he 
pesonally eliminated 800 mines. 
  The new round of minesweeping work set for this year will 
start this month with an expected total of 113 landmine proven 
districts and 187 landmine to be covered this year. The action 
will be completed by the end of this year and the border area by 
that time will be a landmine-free area and open to traffic.
