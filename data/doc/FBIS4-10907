    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 
19 April. 
  According to figures of the Central Bank and the General 
Directorate of Statistics and Census, the country registered a 
$173.5 million trade deficit in the first three months of 1994. 
Although this was nearly $100 million less than in the same 
period in 1993 when the trade deficit reached $273.1 million, 
some economists view this as a bad sign because of the need to 
finance the growing rate of imports. Nevertheless, Central Bank 
President Jorge Corrals said net international reserves amounted 
to $435.7 million on 24 March 1994, adding that they are enough 
to finance five months of imports. (San Jose LA NACION in

  The Foreign Trade Ministry reported on 18 April that banana 
exports dropped 13 percent in the first quarter of 1994, 
although they continue to be the country's second source of 
foreign exchange after tourism. The country sold $109 million 
worth of bananas, while $162 million was earned from tourism. 
Tourism revenue increased 29 percent compared to the same 
period in 1993. Total exports increased to $684 million in the 
first quarter. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2325 GMT 18 Apr 94)
