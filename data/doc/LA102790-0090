METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WITNESSES GIVE DETAILS OF DEPUTIES' 
SPENDING 
An array of bank officers, real estate agents, car salesmen and other business 
representatives took the stand Friday in a federal money-skimming trial as 
prosecutors sought to show the spending habits of seven Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies. 
The narcotics officers, accused of skimming $1.4 million during drug raids, 
allegedly spent much of that money on vacation homes, automobiles, jewelry, 
landscaping and other luxuries, according to prosecutors, who also subpoenaed 
numerous bank records and invoices. 
But in questioning witnesses, defense attorneys contended that although 
deputies made tens of thousands of dollars in purchases -- much of it in cash 
-- they did nothing illegal and made no effort to conceal those financial 
arrangements. 
The defendants, all veteran narcotics deputies, have pleaded not guilty to 
conspiracy, tax evasion and other federal charges. Their trial resumes Tuesday.
