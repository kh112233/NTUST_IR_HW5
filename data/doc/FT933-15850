FT  07 JUL 93 / Clothing company plans 600 jobs
DESMOND AND SONS yesterday announced plans to create 600 jobs in Northern
Ireland in the biggest single investment ever made by an Ulster-owned
clothing company.
The Pounds 24m plan, which is being backed by the Industrial Development
Board, will result in 400 jobs and a purpose-built factory at Magherafelt in
south Londonderry. The announcement is particularly timely as the town was
devastated by an IRA bomb earlier this year. That followed the closure of
two large factories last year.
The investment programme will also add 200 new jobs and improve the
efficiency of the company's existing Northern Ireland plants. The company
currently employs 2,700 in 11 factories across the province.
Mr Robert Atkins, Northern Ireland's economy minister, said: 'The fact that
most of the investment is going to Magherafelt is good news for a town which
has suffered a number of setbacks in the last year.
'Growing demand for Desmond ladieswear - such as shorts and pyjamas - is the
largest single reason for the new investment throughout the group.'
Mr Clinton Silver, deputy chairman of Marks and Spencer, Desmond's main
customer, said the company's ability to compete successfully against
international competition was a clear indication of how M and S regarded the
company's ability to work to world-class standards.
Desmond has bought the former Coats Vyella factory in Magherafelt which it
will use for pilot production while the new plant is built on a site near
the town.
Mr Denis Desmond, company chairman, said: 'The new investment programme
forms a core of our current five-year strategy. The key factors in this
strategy, as in the past, will be market intelligence, design and speed of
response.'
