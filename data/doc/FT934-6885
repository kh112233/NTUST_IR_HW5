FT  23 NOV 93 / Tebbit attacks European move
Lord Tebbit last night accused Britain's political establishment - the
government and the opposition parties - of disorientating and destabilising
the nation.
The former Tory minister and party chairman claimed that parliament was
'living on borrowed time', subservient to Brussels and impotent. He said:
'What are we to make of a governing party which, with the full support of
the two opposition parties, had dedicated itself to the dissolving of the
superglue of nationality?'
Lord Tebbit also warned that Britain was 'drifting towards becoming a
largely pagan society' in which some churches were blessing homosexual
liaisons and where polygamy was recognised when once bigamists were
criminals.
