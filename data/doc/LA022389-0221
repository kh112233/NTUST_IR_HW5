NATION; 
DEATH SENTENCE VOIDED OVER BIBLE 
A federal judge has overturned a condemned murderer's death sentence because 
the jury that convicted him 10 years ago asked for a Bible during 
deliberations, court officials said today. 
In overturning the sentence of Brandon Jones, 31, who was convicted of killing 
a policeman during a service-station robbery, U.S. District Judge Charles Moye 
ruled that the Cobb County jury "had a duty to apply the law of the state of 
Georgia . . . not its own interpretation of the law or its own interpretation 
of precepts of the Bible." The state attorney general's office is now 
considering settling for a life sentence for Jones.
