SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OTAY MESA 
Border Patrol agents found 1,310 pounds of marijuana worth an estimated 
$650,000 early Monday in a pickup truck they stopped near the border. 
According to a Border Patrol report, agents from the Imperial Beach station 
stopped the truck at 3 a.m. as it drove away from the border on Monument Road. 
The driver and a passenger fled the vehicle and escaped into the darkness. 
Agents found eight duffel bags in the truck bed and a drug sniffing dog alerted 
them to the presence of drugs. Inside the bags were 312 sealed cans, labeled as 
jalapeno peppers, but which were filled with marijuana, said the report.
