  [Text] The disintegration of Yugoslavia, predetermined by 
its very creation, has tangled the Balkans in a knot that even 
the most skillful fingers cannot untie. However, there are many 
people willing to do this. They know what benefits they might 
reap. However, those who are most interested in the success of 
the experiment prefer to keep a low profile. 
  There is a real danger of the conflict spreading to other 
Balkan territories. The Americans comfortably deployed their 
units in Macedonia in an attempt to prevent this. However, they 
did not dare send their boys to Bosnia-Herzegovina. They do, 
however, have ideas about how to resolve the situation there -- 
the airplanes will come and everything will be all right. The 
Islamic states also know precisely what they want -- a new 
Muslim state in the heart of Europe that could become a new 
Mecca. 
  Against this background one fails to comprehend the 
passivity 
of some neighbors of the former Yugoslavia, who should have 
perhaps the clearest position on resolving the conflict. Those 
who engage in concocting futile plans should take into 
consideration the opinion of those neighbors, because it is 
their house that will be on the line if the situation eventually 
explodes. 
  Perhaps Sofia is the best example in this respect. Somehow 
its position remains unclear. Why? Perhaps because Sofia is 
concerned that its opinion might affect other countries involved 
in the Balkan crisis. Noninterference is a comfortable policy 
in such cases. While waiting for the storm to pass however, 
Sofia has lost millions of green banknotes. Nevertheless, in 
the long run this could be the least of our losses.
