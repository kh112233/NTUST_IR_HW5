  [Text] Al-'Aqabah -- Citizens here question the seriousness 
of the government in rejecting the U.S. blackmail practiced by 
Washington against Jordan through its warships' siege on the 
Jordanian port, which has inflicted huge economic damage on the 
homeland and citizens. 
  Three days after King Husayn's announcement on the issue of 
al-'Aqabah, the U.S. reaction was an escalation in the piracy of 
the U.S. fleet that is besieging the port and preventing many 
ships from reaching it. 
  Instead of hardening the Jordanian stand, which was 
announced 
by his majesty the king and largely supported by the Jordanians, 
we noticed that our government has ignored all this and received 
the U.S. warship "USS John Hancock" and its officers and sailors 
in the port that they are besieging. The officers and sailors 
of this U.S. warship were warmly welcomed by officials and were 
provided with recreation facilities. After relaxing in our 
country, they returned to continue their siege through their 
piracy and arrogance. 
  Popular organizations, trade unions, women's and student's 
federations, and political forces in al-'Aqabah sent a cable to 
the prime minister and to the speakers and members of the 
Parliament on 12 April in which they protested the visit to the 
Port of al-'Aqabah by a U.S. warship. The cable reads: 
  Allowing the enemies of the nation -- whom we are still 
fighting -- to anchor their fleet ships at our ports, land their 
military planes at our airports, and send their troops to our 
country for rest and recreation is a blatant betrayal of our 
citizens' feelings and disregards their honorable pan-Arab 
stands.
