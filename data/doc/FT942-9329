FT  17 MAY 94 / Mexico exhaust catalyst plant
Chemicals group Johnson Matthey is to build a car exhaust catalyst plant in
Mexico with a capacity of 1m units a year, writes John Griffiths.
The facility, costing Pounds 5m (Dollars 7.5m) and to be located 140 miles
north-west of Mexico City, near Queretaro, is due to go on stream at the end
of this year, supplying Mexico's rapidly expanding motor industry.
The catalysts, comprising a thin coating of precious metals on a cylindrical
substrate, are the active component of the catalytic converter systems being
made mandatory by the Mexican government as part of efforts to reduce severe
city air pollution.
Johnson Matthey, which claims to be the world's largest catalyst producer,
with over a third of the world market, is also planning to build a similar
plant in Malaysia, in a joint venture with HICOM Berhad, a government
investment agency.
