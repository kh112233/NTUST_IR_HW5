  [Text] For the first time in Japan, a ``solid electrolyte 
fuel cell'' has been successfully operated, by Electric Power 
Development Co., Ltd. (EPD). The cell, which is under joint 
development with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI), was in 
operation for an accumulated total time of 3,000 hours. The 
1-kW-output fuel cell is being test-operated at Wakamatsu 
General Office (Kitakyushu City) of EPD. The cell was 
inspected after 500 hours of initial test-operation, which had 
begun in June 1993, and, subsequently, the test operation was 
resumed for a period of 2,500 hours. 
  Generally speaking, in order to commercially operate a fuel 
cell for a profit, an output of 200 kW or more and continuous 
operation for 40,000 hours are said to be the requirements for a 
dispersion-type power source. Therefore, it is difficult to 
commercialize a cell under development in the early stage. EPD 
plans to develop a 10-kW-output cell prior to its full-scale 
attempt at commercialization. 
  A fuel cell generates electricity from the reaction of 
hydrogen with oxygen, which is the reverse of water 
electrolysis. The type of fuel cell depends upon the type of 
electrolyte necessary for the reaction. For example, stabilized 
zirconia is used for the solid electrolyte type. Power 
generation efficiency as high as 50-60 percent can be expected 
if the fuel cell, with a high internal reaction temperature of 
900-1,000C, is combined into a composite power-generation 
system with either a gas or steam turbine using high-temperature 
exhaust gas. 
  EPD is using hydrogen as the fuel for the test operation, 
although coal gas can also be used. EPD will continue the 
development of a power source to replace thermally generated 
power by combining the gasification technology with its 
negligible impact on the environment.
