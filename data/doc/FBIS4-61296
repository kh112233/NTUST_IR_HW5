  [Text] More than 20 Tu-22 combat planes of two Black Sea 
Fleet aviation corps are prepared to be ferried to Russia, the 
Ukrainian Defense Ministry press service told INTERFAX. 
  The press service said the command of the 2d aviation 
division of the Black Sea Fleet was "secretly preparing the 
action intended to be carried out during the next flight 
exercises of the Black Sea Fleet aviation." The planes are 
supposed to take off from the bases of Veseloye and Oktyabrskoye 
in Crimea, meet somewhere above the Azov Sea and land at the 
Krymsk military airdrome, Krasnodar territory. 
  The press service said that "any attempts to take military 
hardware and other material values belonging to the Black Sea 
Fleet are illegal and will inevitably lead to an aggravation of 
the situation around the division of the Black Sea Fleet." 
  The press center of the Black Sea Fleet told Interfax that 
the reports on ferrying Black Sea Fleet aviation to Russia were 
not true. The head of the press center, Andrey Grachev, said 
they were a "figment of the imagination" of the Ukrainian 
Defense Ministry.
