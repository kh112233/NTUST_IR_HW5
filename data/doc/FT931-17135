FT  02 JAN 93 / Patten orders inquiry into fatal Hong Kong revels
VERNOR Chris Patten ordered an inquiry yesterday into a New Year stampede in
which 20 young revellers were trampled to death, saying lessons must be
learnt before the Chinese New Year festival in three weeks, Reuter reports
from Hong Kong.
The victims, including two teenagers believed to be British and a Japanese,
perished as more than 15,000 revellers poured into a narrow, beer-slickened
street after the stroke of midnight.
Three of 17 people admitted to hospital were in a critical condition,
officials said.
Police watched helplessly for several minutes, unable to reach the mostly
teenage victims who one officer said simply dropped from sight to be crushed
underfoot.
Mr Patten said the inquiry, under high court judge Kemal Bokhary, should
start early next week, as speed was essential to avoid similar chaos at the
Lunar New Year, which has been marked by tragedies for two years running.
