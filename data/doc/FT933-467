FT  29 SEP 93 / EOC urges Hunt to back better maternity rights
THE Equal Opportunities Commission yesterday urged Mr David Hunt, employment
secretary, to back its campaign for better maternity rights. The government
was accused by Ms Karnlesh Bahl, who chairs the commission, of 'missing a
golden opportunity to create a clear, simple, forward-looking maternity
rights scheme which could be easily understood by both pregnant women and
employers'.
The commission says it is concerned that 'the spirit of the European
Community directive on maternity rights (due to be implemented by October
next year) has been lost in translation into UK legislation'. In Britain
women will be entitled to only 14 weeks maternity leave after which they
will be vulnerable to dismissal if they remain away.
The government proposes that employers alone should meet maternity costs.
The commission fears that such a system might lead employers to discriminate
against women.
The commission argues that 2.25m women who earn less than Pounds 56 a week
will fail to qualify for statutory maternity pay. It adds that notification
procedures for pregnant women to take leave will remain complex. It also
says women will have the right to 18 weeks' pay but only 14 weeks' leave,
and that this could lead to discriminatory practices and even dismissals.
It also points out that statutory maternity pay amounts to less than 20 per
cent of women's average earnings while women workers in the UK take 30 weeks
maternity leave but receive no pay for their final 12 weeks away from work.
The EOC wants Mr Hunt to:
Provide guidance to employers on non-discriminatory recruitment policies.
Adopt a system for leave that would pay women Pounds 52.50 a week for 18
weeks - and 90 per cent of pay for the first 6 weeks to women who had worked
for at least 26 weeks with their present employer. Change the law 'as soon
as is practicable' to extend maternity leave from 14 weeks to 18 weeks.
