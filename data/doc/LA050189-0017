TABLE TOP FUSION 
The recent dramatic announcement at a press conference in Salt Lake City, that 
nuclear fusion had been achieved at room temperature, seems to have produced a 
state of hysteria that interfers with normal scientific communication. 
Concerning the Utah experiments: 
If one accepts that heat is generated and that neutrons appear in far too few 
numbers to account for that heat, one is led to consider reactions in which the 
two deuterons form Helium-4, rather than Helium-3 and a neutron. The experts 
dismiss this possibility by saying that a high-energy gamma ray must also be 
produced, and it is not observed. They are thinking of reactions in essentially 
empty space. This one takes place within an atomic lattice. A nearby Palladium 
nucleus might play the role of the gamma ray. 
But, theoretical speculations aside, this line of thought suggests a crucial 
experiment, one that I have tried, without success, to bring to the attention 
of the appropriate people. 
Would someone, with access to an apparatus producing heat and neutrons, please 
look at the evolved gases to see whether Helium-4 is present? Should it be -- 
and mindful of the large energy released in this reaction -- are there 
sufficient numbers to account for the heat generated? 
According to your April 18 article ("Helium Find Gives Lift to Fusion 
Chemists," Part I), Helium-4 has indeed been detected by University of Utah 
chemists. 
Unfortunately, the news article described Helium-4 as "a rare form of helium." 
It is, in fact, by far the predominant form.
