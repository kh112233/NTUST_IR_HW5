  [Text] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's Liberal 
Democratic Party, said he would seek to become head of an 
international affairs committee in the new parliament, fight for 
the dismissal of Andrey Kozyrev as foreign minister, and replace 
him in that capacity. 
  Talking to journalists in Shchelkovo, a town near Moscow, on 
Thursday [6 January] Zhirinovskiy said, addressing Japanese 
reporters: "You'd better not raise the Kuril Islands issue, 
otherwise we'll bring up the issue of compensation for the 40 
years of the illegal use of Sakhalin by Japan." 
  "We'll drive everyone out of the Sea of Okhotsk -- the 
Japanese, the Koreans, the Filipinos... The Sea of Okhotsk will 
be a closed Russian sea. We'll establish a 200-mile zone, and 
you'll be fishing in Australia," Zhirinovskiy said to the 
Japanese journalists.
