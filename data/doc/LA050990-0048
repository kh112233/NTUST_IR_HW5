DAY A WINNER FOR CALIFORNIA CONGRESSMAN 
Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), a congressional leader in science and 
technology policy, had a good day at the office Tuesday. 
Brown received a top award from the National Science Foundation. He also won 
House passage of a bill to devote $150 million to hydrogen fuel research at the 
Energy Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
The bill, approved by voice vote, will have to be reconciled with a similar, 
Senate-passed measure before it goes to President Bush, who is expected to sign 
it. 
Brown was the only person outside of the National Science Foundation to receive 
its 1990 Distinguished Public Service Award. He was instrumental in creating 
the Office of Technology Assessment and the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy, and the award cited his "persistent and effective efforts in support of 
science and engineering research and education."
