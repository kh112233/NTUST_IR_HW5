Disease Associated with Exposure to Certain Herbicide Agents (Multiple Myeloma and Respiratory Cancers) 


<AGENCY>
AGENCY:

 Department of Veterans Affairs. 


</AGENCY>
<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Proposed rule. 



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive
service connection for certain diseases even though there is no record of the disease during service. This proposed
amendment is necessary to implement a decision of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the authority granted by
the Agent Orange Act of 1991 that there is a positive association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic
of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and the subsequent development of multiple myeloma and respiratory cancers. The
intended effect of this proposed amendment is to establish presumptive service connection for those conditions
based on herbicide exposure. 


</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments must be received on or before March 7, 1994. Comments will be available for public inspection until March
15, 1994.

<ADDRESS>
ADDRESSES:

 Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, suggestions, or objections regarding this amendment
to Secretary of Veterans Affairs (271A), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC
20420. All written comments received will be available for public inspection only in the Veterans Services Unit,
room 170, at the above address between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday (except holidays).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 2(a)(1) of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Public Law 1024, 105 Stat. 11 (1991), added 38 U.S.C. 1116 which
established presumptive service connection for veterans with service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era who subsequently develop, to a degree of 10 percent or more, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma (subject
to specified statutory exceptions), and chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne (within
one year of the last date of active service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era), even though there is no
record of that disease during military service. Final regulations implementing this statutory provision were published
in the 

Federal Register

 of May 19, 1993 (See 58 FR 2910709). 


Section 3 of Public Law 1024 directed the Secretary to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) to review the scientific evidence concerning the association between exposure to herbicides used in support
of military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era and each disease suspected to be associated
with such exposure. Congress mandated that NAS determine, to the extent possible: (1) Whether there is a statistical
association between the suspect diseases and herbicide exposure, taking into account the strength of the scientific
evidence and the appropriateness of the methods used to detect the association; (2) the increased risk of disease
among individuals exposed to herbicides during service in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era; and (3)
whether there is a plausible biological mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship between herbicide exposure
and the suspect disease. 
Section 1116(b) of 38 U.S.C. provides that whenever the Secretary determines, based on sound medical and scientific
evidence, that a positive association exists between exposure of humans to an herbicide agent (i.e., a chemical in
an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during
the Vietnam era) and a disease, the Secretary will publish regulations establishing presumptive service connection
for that disease. An association is considered ``positive'' if the credible evidence for the association is equal
to or outweighs the credible evidence against the association. In making that determination, the Secretary is to
consider reports received from NAS as well as other available sound medical and scientific evidence and analyses.
