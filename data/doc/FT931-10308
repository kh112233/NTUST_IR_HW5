FT  09 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television
A strong night on BBC 2, which is just as well looking at the competition -
unless you are a fan of Spender (BBC 1, 9.30), which in its last episode
sees the Geordie cop getting to grips with a crooked property developer and
his troublesome ex-wife.
The Gun and The Veil (BBC 2, 7.45) investigates the profound influence of
the spirit of Islamic renewal on Egyptian society. The blind theologian,
Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman, leader of the outlawed Islamic League, is
interviewed in exile in New York and declares his conviction that the
government of President Mubarak must be overthrown. He and his followers
also justify the recent bloody attacks on tourists. Women speak about their
reactions to pressure to adopt pious dress and behaviour.
Viewers new to The Ark (BBC 2, 9.25), the documentary series about London
Zoo, may not find it easy to appreciate tonight's denouement, the Special
General Meeting which seals (no pun intended) the fate of London Zoo's
management and director. But watch it, all the same. Clever, subtle, and
absorbing, The Ark has been a joy.
