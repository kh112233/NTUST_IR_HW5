FT  20 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Stamping out the
forgeries - In a Nutshell
Barclays Bank says it intercepted more than Pounds 1.7m worth of counterfeit
banknotes in 1992 and has issued a seven-point checklist to help small
businesses to detect forgeries.
Even if a business accepts a note in good faith, it could lose money because
the law requires it to be handed to the police.
Ultra-violet lamps are not fool-proof since notes which have been in contact
with recently washed clothes may fluoresce while fakes printed on
ultra-violet dull paper will not. Notes in a reasonable condition should be
crisp and not limp, shiny or waxy. The print should be clear and not blurred
or hazy. Notes should contain a continuous thread embedded in the paper.
The watermark should be hardly noticeable until the note is held up to the
light when a portrait becomes visible. Notes of Pounds 10 and Pounds 20 are
the most popular forgeries, Barclays warned.
