FT  24 DEC 94 / Israeli soldiers killed
Two Israeli soldiers were killed and seven wounded in heavy exchanges of
fire with Shia Moslem Hizbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon yesterday.
Two Lebanese policemen died when an Israeli helicopter launched a missile at
their car during a bombing raid three miles north of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone.
The clashes began when Hizbollah opened machine-gun and mortar fire at
Israeli strongpoints and villages controlled by the pro-Israeli South
Lebanese Army in the eastern sector of the nine-mile-deep security belt
north of the international border. Israeli artillery fired back at Hizbollah
targets. A military spokesman in Tel-Aviv claimed that they inflicted
casualties but no details were available.
