  [Text] Hong Kong--At 11 o'clock yesterday morning, a man 
who said he had come from Zhejiang and was going somewhere by 
way of Hong Kong, telephoned the Editorial Department of LIEN HO 
PAO and said that on the day the incident occurred on the 
Hairui, his friends and he were on the spot, saw several armed 
mainland servicemen board the ship, and shortly after, the two 
ships sailed off at the same time. 
  The man said that on 31 March, the day of the Hairui 
tragedy, 
several of his friends and he were on the spot on another ship. 
He said: "I saw a ship with more than 10 persons armed with 
guns and in army uniforms berthing by the side of Hairui. 
Several of them boarded the Hairui. Very soon, the two ships 
sailed off at the same time." 
  The man, who was unwilling to give his name, said, "The ship 
with personnel in army uniforms belonged to Anhui Province." He 
also said: "My three friends, who were on the same ship with 
me, told local people about the matter and were immediately put 
into prison by public security personnel." 
  When an editor of LIEN HO PAO wished to see the man to find 
out details, he politely declined by saying that he was leaving 
Hong Kong.
