CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ELEPHANT MEMORIES THIRTEEN YEARS IN THE LIFE OF AN ELEPHANT 
FAMILY BY CYNTHIA MOSS(FAWCETT COLUMBINE: $10.95, ILLUSTRATED) 
Moss offers a scholarly but highly readable account of the complex social 
behavior of the elephants in Kenya's Amboseli Park. 
In the most intriguing chapters, Moss presents evidence that these intelligent 
animals have a concept of death. They bury their dead and, unlike other 
animals, recognize skeletons of their own species. When elephants encounter 
another's bones, they caress them with their trunks, paying special attention 
to the skulls of relatives. 
African elephants are finding those remains with alarming frequency: 80,000 
elephants -- almost 10% of the total population in Africa -- are slaughtered 
each year for their ivory. As elephants produce one calf every three to five 
years, the species obviously can't sustain this decimation. 
But Moss concludes that competition for space with a burgeoning human 
population may pose an even greater threat. The population of Kenya is expected 
to double by the end of the century, and much of the arable land in the country 
is prime elephant habitat. Although Moss argues eloquently for their 
protection, the extinction of the African elephant appears imminent.
