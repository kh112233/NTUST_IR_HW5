 

(h) Propane. Propane is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in new industrial
process refrigeration equipment. See the discussion on propane under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and
R502 industrial process refrigeration. 

(i) Propylene. Propylene is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in new industrial
process refrigeration. See the discussion on propylene under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502
industrial process refrigeration. 

(j) Butane. Butane is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in new industrial
process refrigeration. See the discussion on butane under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502
industrial process refrigeration.

(k) Hydrocarbon Blend A. Hydrocarbon Blend A is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502
in new industrial process refrigeration equipment. See the discussion on this blend under 
retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration. 

(l) Chlorine. Chlorine is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in new industrial
process refrigeration equipment. See the discussion on chlorine under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12,
and R502 industrial process refrigeration. 

(m) Evaporative cooling. Evaporative cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to industrial process
refrigeration using CFC11, CFC12, or R502. See the discussion on evaporative cooling under
new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(n) Desiccant cooling. Desiccant cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to industrial process refrigeration
using CFC11, CFC12, or R502. See the discussion on desiccant cooling under new CFC11,
CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(o) Nitrogen direct gas expansion. Nitrogen direct gas expansion is acceptable as an alternative technology to industrial
process refrigeration using CFC12, R500, or R502. Nitrogen is expanded within an enclosed area
to absorb heat. The cycle is open; the nitrogen is released to the atmosphere after absorbing heat from the container.
Nitrogen is a common gas that is nontoxic and nonflammable. 

(p) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to industrial process refrigeration
using CFC11, CFC12, or R502. See the discussion on the Stirling cycle under new CFC11,
CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(11) R400(60/40) and CFC114 Industrial Process Air Conditioning, Retrofit. (a) HCFC124. HCFC124
is acceptable as a substitute for R400 (60/40) and CFC114 in industrial process air conditioning. HCFC124
has a very low ODP and GWP. HCFC124 is the only refrigerant that has been submitted for this end-use, and EPA invites
more submissions and information related to substitutes. 

(12) R400(60/40) and CFC114 Industrial Process Air Conditioning, New. (a) HCFC124. HCFC124
is acceptable as a substitute for R400 (60/40) and CFC114 in industrial process air conditioning. HCFC124
has a very low ODP and GWP. It is nonflammable. HCFC124 is the only refrigerant that has been submitted for this
end-use, and EPA invites more submissions and information related to substitutes. 

(13) CFC12 and R502 Ice Skating Rinks, Retrofit. Please note that different temperature regimes may
affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. 

(a) HCFC22. HCFC22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in retrofitted ice
skating rinks. See the discussion on HCFC22 under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114,
and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in retrofitted ice
skating rinks. See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal chillers. 

(c) R401A and R401B. R401A and R401B, which consist of HCFC22, HFC152a,
and HCFC124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC12 and R502 in retrofitted ice skating rinks.
See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process
refrigeration. 

(d) Ammonia. Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in retrofitted
ice skating rinks. See the discussion on ammonia under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114,
and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(14) CFC12 and R502 Ice Skating Rinks, New. Please note that different temperature regimes may affect
the applicability of substitutes within this end-use.
