ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HAZARDOUS SPILLS 
The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, or HAZMAT, is administered by the 
county Health Care Agency division of environmental health. It responds to 
calls on chemical spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. 
Sometimes it goes to the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire 
departments over the phone. 
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (16 city departments plus the 
county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the entire county 
through mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county 
station in Irvine. HAZMAT is called in most, but not all, hazardous spills.
