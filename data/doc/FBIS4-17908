  [Text] Moscow, April 27 (TASS) -- Member of the Russian 
Parliament lower house Andrey Ayzderdzis was shot and killed 
from a shotgun near his house in Moscow's satellite city of 
Khimki on Tuesday evening. 
  ITAR-TASS learnt from Igor Negrustuyev, public relations 
officer of the Russian chief criminal investigation department, 
that the shotgun was found at a house basement during the 
investigation. Ayzderdzis died of a gun wound in the right part 
of the thorax. 
  The police dog brought investigators to a nearby parking 
lot. 
Eye-witnesses are being questioned. Investigation develops five 
versions. 
  Aydzerdzis, b. 1958, was member of the "New Regional Policy" 
parliamentary faction. He was board chairman of the MDK-Bank 
(authorised capital 240 million roubles) and board chairman of 
the International Business Corporation before December 1993. 
  However, following the election to parliament, he left the 
former posts. The Moscow press printed reports on the 
controversial nature of Ayzderdzis's business activities.
