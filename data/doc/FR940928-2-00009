SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 C.F.R. 404.7 The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within sixty days from the date of

would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.


U.S. Patent 5,307,680 relates to a process for the detection and mapping of internal stresses in the interior of bulk
materials by scanning acoustic technique.
NIST may enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (``CRADA'') to perform further research on
the invention for purposes of commercialization. The CRADA may be conducted by NIST without any additional charge
to any party that licenses the patent. NIST may grant the licensee an option to negotiate for royalty-free exclusive
licenses to any jointly owned inventions which arise from the CRADA as well as an option to negotiate for exclusive
royalty-bearing licenses for NIST employee inventions which arise from the CRADA.
The availability of the invention for licensing was published in the Federal Register, Vol. 58, No. 49 (March 16, 1993).
A copy of the patent may be obtained from NIST at the foregoing address.
