COLLEGES PUSH FOR PASSAGE OF PROP. 111 
Most voters know it as the gasoline-tax initiative. 
But the quality of California's higher education system also hinges on passage 
of Proposition 111 at the polls June 5, Orange County college leaders said 
Monday in a rare joint news conference at UC Irvine. 
Without the measure, which would raise the state's voter-passed spending limit 
as well the tax on gas, UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason and others said 
colleges probably will be forced to curtail enrollments, raise admission 
standards and increase student fees by 20% or more. 
"There is no more critical question before the people of California," Peltason 
said. "Really, the future of the University of California is on the line with 
Proposition 111." 
Passage of a second ballot measure, Proposition 121, is vital to ensure the 
building of classrooms and facilities needed to keep pace with an exploding 
college student population, said Peltason and representatives of Cal State 
Fullerton, Cal State Long Beach and the Rancho Santiago Community College 
District. 
The $450-million bond measure would fund planning and construction of 
classrooms, faculty offices, research facilities and library space and also 
ensure earthquake safety and asbestos removal at California's public 
universities and colleges. 
Seven campuses in Orange County would share $38,655,000 of that, including 
nearly $16 million earmarked for equipment and renovation of biological science 
facilities at UCI; $5.9 million for a gymnasium and a child-care center at 
Irvine Valley College, and $1.3 million for a library addition at Rancho 
Santiago College in Santa Ana. 
Proposition 121 is especially important to UCI and Cal State Long Beach, which 
are poised to begin construction of long-planned vital projects. 
Cal State Fullerton's $1.6 million in bond funds would cover preliminary plans 
and working drawings for additions and renovations to the library, science and 
physical education buildings on the campus, where enrollment has been kept at 
about 25,000 students because of cramped facilities. 
"We're just filled to the gills, and we really can't accommodate new students 
unless we get more facilities," said Jack Coleman, CSUF vice president for 
academic affairs. "Brick and mortar for us is very, very important." 
The list of capital projects for colleges and universities covered by 
Proposition 121 is easy for voters to grasp. 
More complex are the elements of Proposition 111, the so-called gasoline tax 
and traffic congestion relief measure. 
That initiative would allow the state gas tax to double over a five-year 
period, from the present 9 cents per gallon to 18 cents, and it would increase 
highway user fees. It also would raise the so-called Gann spending limit voters 
passed in 1979 and permit the state to spend roughly $1 billion more than it 
can now. 
The measure is endorsed by Gov. George Deukmejian, the University of California 
Board of Regents, and a host of other elected officials and community leaders. 
Critics have long argued that such an increase in the spending limit was 
needed. 
The state is already just $143 million under its maximum spending limit for the 
1990-91 fiscal year, which begins July 1. The gas-tax measure alone would 
generate an average of $1.5 billion a year more -- money that could not be 
spent without raising the spending limit. 
That, in turn, would jeopardize the gains teachers and schools made last 
November under Proposition 98, which mandated that schools get 40% of all 
general-purpose tax revenue and the bulk of any surplus above the spending 
limit championed by tax crusader Paul Gann. The June ballot measure proposes 
revising the language of the school spending law according to a compromise 
forged by the governor and teachers' unions, which had threatened to oppose 
Proposition 111. 
For the state's community colleges, which are protected by Proposition 98 
funding formulas along with elementary and secondary schools, passage of 
Proposition 111 will mean about $35 million to $40 million in added state 
funds, said Robert Jensen, chancellor of the Rancho Santiago Community College 
District in central Orange County. 
It will not mean more money this year for the University of California and 
California State University systems, however. New projections show that state 
tax revenues will fall far short of expectations. 
By raising the cap on spending from 6.9% a year to 7.7%, the governor and state 
Legislature in better budget years will have greater discretion to fund 
competing health, law enforcement and education programs, Orange County 
educators said. 
With the property-tax-cutting Proposition 13 in 1978, the Gann limit and now 
the mandatory funding for education in Proposition 98, Peltason said, the 
voters have "effectively stripped the governor and the Legislature of almost 
complete discretion. And they have reduced the scope of opportunity to provide 
funds to support the institutions of higher education." 
This comes at a time when more and more students are seeking college education, 
he said. The enrollment for UCI itself is projected to rise to 26,000 students 
-- 10,000 more than now -- by the year 2005. 
If the spending limit is not increased, the University of California will have 
to rethink its mandate to admit the top 12.5% of the state's students. "We 
would have to turn away large numbers of students," Peltason said. 
The UC system also would have to reconsider its historic policy against 
charging tuition for California residents, he suggested. 
COLLEGE PROJECTS 
Here are totals for Orange County college capital projects contained in 
Proposition 121, a general obligation bond measure on the June 5 ballot. Also 
included is the total for construction projects at Cal State Long Beach 
(one-third of its 33,000 students live in Orange County).
