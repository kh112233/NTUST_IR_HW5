FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: AAH bids IPounds 24.9m for Cahill May
Roberts
THE BATTLE for market share in Ireland's IPounds 300m (Pounds 320m)
pharmaceutical distribution industry took a new turn yesterday, when AAH
Holdings made a cash and shares offer for Cahill May Roberts Group.
The offer, on a 10-for-51 basis, is being recommended by CMRG's board and
values Ireland's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler at IPounds 24.9m,
representing a 70 per cent premium over its last traded price of 55p on the
Dublin USM.
There is a partial cash alternative of 87p a share.
By yesterday evening, a pre-condition of the offer, that directors of CMRG
and their families, and Allied Combined Trust, which together hold 54 per
cent of the ordinary share capital, accept irrevocably, had been met.
AAH is the UK's largest pharmaceutical wholesaler with annual turnover in
excess of Pounds 1.3bn. It has wholesale and franchised retail activities in
Northern Ireland.
The offer has been triggered by merger talks which began last month between
United Drug, another pharmaceutical wholesaler in the Republic, and Alchem
in Northern Ireland, which would result in a group with a combined turnover
of IPounds 110m. CMRG reported turnover of IPounds 90m in 1991.
Mr Bill Pybus, AAH chairman, said: 'We have been interested in CMRG for some
time, but when United Drug decided to merge with Alchem we decided to go
ahead with an offer.'
Last year, United Drug was awarded the franchise for AAH's Vantage retail
activity for the Republic, so its Alchem merger plan would put it into
direct competition with AAH's own business in Northern Ireland. CMRG is now
likely to take over the Vantage franchise in the Republic.
