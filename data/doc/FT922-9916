FT  05 MAY 92 / Argentina seeks US fighter jets
ARGENTINA has said it wants to take up an offer by the US government to sell
it fighter aircraft, ending the arms embargo clamped on Argentina by Britain
and the US after the Falklands conflict 10 years ago.
The American A4M Skyhawks would replace aircraft Argentina lost in 1982.
On Friday, Brigadier Jose Julia, air force commander, announced his
'absolute conviction that before the end of the year we will see in our
skies more, and better combat aircraft.'
US officials played down the importance of the proposed sale. They noted
that the Skyhawks were obsolete, and that they would not be supplied with
weapons systems.
