  [Text] Commenting on the Russian president's address at the 
Russian parliament yesterday, Estonian Foreign Minister Juri 
Luik said that it had not recalled the need to withdraw troops 
from the Baltic states by 31 August. The foreign minister said 
that on several occasions the so-called protection of Russians' 
rights had been mentioned, and these are not the generally 
accepted human rights that are the case here but the rights of 
Russians. A threatening voice was used repeatedly in the course 
of the speech, firm and tough action was promised in protection 
of those rights. Russia did not make a reference to 
international law. Instead, she takes the liberty to interfere 
in the domestic affairs of others whenever she sees fit. 
  Luik is worried about the Russian president's (?statement) 
that regarding relations with the West there have been 
concessions made unilaterally, [word indistinct] in respect of 
the state budget. It seems that the idea of dismantling the 
totalitarian war machine has been abandoned and it is considered 
important to restore it. 
  [Words indistinct] that part of the speech devoted to 
Europe. 
The impression is that there is no desire to accept the 
standards that exist in Europe; instead, there is a desire to 
rework them. Such an approach is incomprehensible to Estonia. 
Estonia is fully satisfied with a Europe based on a market 
economy and a policy of consensus. It emerges quite clearly 
what Russia's interests are. It remains completely unclear, 
though, how Russia plans to consider other countries' interests, 
said Foreign Minister Luik.
