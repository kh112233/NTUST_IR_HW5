This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), U.S. Department of Commerce, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive license in Canada and Australia
to practice the invention embodied in Patent Nos. 1,311,527 (Canada) and 618088 (Australia), titled ``Electromagnetic
Fire Warning System for Underground Mines,'' to VLF Magnetic Systems, Inc., having a place of business in Ontario,
Canada. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America.
The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. While the primary purpose of this notice is to announce NTIS' intent to grant an exclusive license
to practice the noted foreign patents, it also serves to publish said patents' availability for licensing in accordance
with law. The availability of the invention for licensing was published as U.S. patent application, S.N. 7201,
235, in the 

Federal Register

 of September 22, 1988 (Vol. 53, No. 184, p. 36875). The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within
90 days from the date of this published notice, NTIS receives written evidence and argument which establishes that
the grant of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.
The present invention describes an electromagnetic warning system for miners working in underground mines wherein
the warning system comprises: a transmitter unit for transmitting an ultra-low frequency signal through the strata
that define the mine openings; an ultra-low frequency receiver unit equipped with a high permeability ferrite core
antenna which is tuned to the frequency of the transmitter unit for producing a warning signal to the miners within
an underground mine.
Information concerning the above-identified invention may be obtained from the NTIS at the address below.
Any inquiries and comments relating to the contemplated license must be submitted to Neil L. Mark, Office of Federal
Patent Licensing, NTIS, Box 1423, Springfield, Virginia 22151. Properly field competing license applications
received by the NTIS in response to this notice will be considered as objections to the grant of the contemplated license.
