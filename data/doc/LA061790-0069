SALINAS SEEKING JAPAN'S AID IN POLLUTION FIGHT 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari arrived Saturday for a five-day 
visit to finalize three Japanese aid projects that will help combat Mexico's 
severe air pollution. 
Local press reports said Japan would provide $780 million for the projects. 
Mexico has planned to promote the use of unleaded gasoline and the 
desulphurization of heavy crude oil and diesel oils. 
Last year, Mexico asked Japan and the United States, among other industrial 
nations and international groups, to help finance 26 projects to fight air 
pollution in Mexico City, which is among the worst in the Western Hemisphere. 
Salinas will meet Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and Emperor Akihito on Monday.
