<F P=106> [ETA report: "Almost 80,000 Agricultural Workers Lost Their </F>
Jobs"] 
  [Text] As a result of the property reform in 
agriculture, by the end of 1992, 37,000 persons had lost their 
previous place of employment in Estonia; in 1993 this number 
increased by another 37,000, Minister of Agriculture Jaan 
Leetsar reported at a press conference on Monday. 
  "These people have been laid off their former jobs and get 
by 
on occasional jobs, as farm laborers, timber loggers, or 
gathering wild berries," added the minister. Several years ago 
Estonia had 360 large farms, which as a result of the property 
reform have been reorganized into almost 7,000 new agricultural 
production units, among which are 4,300 family farms, more than 
1,200 joint-stock companies, more than 500 shareholding 
partnerships, and others. 
  "The Ministry of Agriculture does not yet have figures on 
how 
many rural residents have income as proprietors and how many are 
living by selling their labor," stated Leetsar. Computers 
purchased by the ministry with the aid of Italy will enable it 
to establish computer links with districts and give the ministry 
a sufficiently clear picture of the processes taking place in 
the countryside, said the minister.
