FT  18 DEC 93 / Prosecution witness admits misleading Old Bailey
A senior civil servant who was a prosecution witness in last year's
collapsed trial of executives of engineering company Matrix Churchill
yesterday admitted that he misled the Old Bailey on three occasions, Rachel
Johnson writes.
Mr Eric Beston, former head of export controls at the Department of Trade
and Industry, told the Scott inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair he had
been 'mistaken' and had 'misled' himself.
The trial collapsed after ministers failed to suppress documents showing
that the government had known all along that the company was selling
equipment to Iraqi munitions factories. This led to Lord Justice Scott's
investigation. The inquiry was adjourned until the new year.
