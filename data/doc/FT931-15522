FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: Genentech expects fall in
profits
THE president of Genentech, the California-based biotechnology company that
was taken over in 1990 by Roche Holdings of Switzerland, yesterday said the
company expected to report more than Dollars 18m of net profits for 1992.
The forecast, while sharply down on the Dollars 44.3m of net earnings
recorded in 1991, is in line with industry estimates.
Revenues were expected to rise above Dollars 540m for 1992, compared to
Dollars 515.9m in 1991, according to Mr Kirk Raab, president and chief
executive of the company. Mr Raab said 1993 revenues could reach Dollars
560m.
The company's last reported earnings - for the third quarter of 1992 -
showed a 43 per cent drop in net income to Dollars 7.7m. Revenues in the
third quarter were 2 per cent improved at Dollars 137.3m.
Genentech's net profits for the first nine months of 1992 amounted to
Dollars 14.6m, down from Dollars 44.2m in the same period of 1991. Revenues
for the first nine months were Dollars 402.3m, up from Dollars 396.4m.
Mr Raab attributed the expected 1992 earnings decline to flat sales of
Activase, the heart disease drug, and a steep rise in spending on research
and development. Among the most expensive research projects are the clinical
trials of Activase and a related product for the treatment of cystic
fibrosis.
On Wall Street, Genentech's stock price closed Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars
38 3/4 .
