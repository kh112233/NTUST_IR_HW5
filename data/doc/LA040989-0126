The Utah Legislature overwhelmingly approved $5 million to finance a reported 
discovery of simple, safe and inexpensive nuclear fusion that University of 
Utah scientists say could revolutionize energy production. With only two 
dissenting votes, the 75-member House in Salt Lake City approved separate bills 
establishing an oversight committee and appropriating $5 million through fiscal 
1990 for fusion research and development. The state Senate approved the 
measures with only a single opposing vote cast. Fusion was the sole topic of a 
one-day special session of the Legislature, called by Gov. Norman H. Bangerter 
to support the discovery announced March 23 by researchers at the university.
