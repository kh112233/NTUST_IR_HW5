<F P=106> [Interview with General Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief </F>
of Border Guards, by Igor Chernyak; place and date not given: 
"`Barbed Wire' Will Remain in the Past. Border Guards Commander 
in Chief Andrey Nikolayev Intends To Bring About a Revolution on 
the Border"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The kind of respect shown by 
subordinates to their leader Nikolayev is rarely encountered 
these days. Border Guards officers have the following to say 
about their 45-year-old commander in chief: "His first 
statement on taking up his post was: `I will not tolerate 
rudeness by senior ranks to subordinates.' During the past year 
he has not once raised his voice against his subordinates. The 
ability to talk tough without destroying the human element in a 
man is a rare quality among generals." 
  [Nikolayev] I inherited my poor eyesight from my mother. 
When I speak about my father, I cannot fail to mention her as 
well. My mother was a graduate of the Literature Institute; she 
wrote poetry and left several notebooks of wonderful lyric 
poems. These poems trace the progress of my father's career and 
my own. Thanks to my mother we were from childhood surrounded by 
wonderful people -- Soloukhin, Rozhdestvenskiy, and aunt Lyuda 
Kasatkina were close friends of my mother's, as was uncle 
Serezha Kolosov -- do you know the film "Drawing Fire"? My 
father, however, was surrounded by military men, so we had a 
wide circle of acquaintances. 
  [Chernyak] Have you lived all your life in Moscow? 
  [Nikolayev] While I have been a soldier my family has moved 
14 times. I started out as a platoon commander, then moved up 
through a company, regiment, and division, and before being 
transferred to the General Staff I commanded an army. 
  [Chernyak] Andrey Ivanovich, increasingly we hear people say 
that when you left to join the Border Guards you took the best 
remaining General Staff cadres along with you and created what 
amounted to your own mini-General Staff with its own Central 
Command Post. A number of military experts acknowledge that all 
this has had a positive impact on the controllability of the 
troops entrusted to you, joking that your former colleagues from 
the Arbat may soon be coming to see you for experience.... 
  [Nikolayev] I can give you figures relating to the number of 
people who came to our apparatus from the Ministry of Defense 
and the General Staff, and I can assure you that the numbers 
were small. During the time I worked on the General Staff I 
developed the deepest respect for that structure. If someone 
leaves it for reasons of redundancy, age, or whatever, we are 
always prepared to offer them a position, especially as people 
work five years longer here than in the Army. By helping these 
people who have the highest professional training we are 
primarily keeping them for the state. However, both the 
Ministry of Defense and the Border Guards are working for a 
common cause, so I see no problems about this. I hardly need 
say that the General Staff is not someone's personal fiefdom but 
a place where the cream of the Armed Forces is gathered 
together, and it is no surprise that, when people leave the 
General Staff to work for us, they bring their ideas with them. 
  [Chernyak] The newspapers have recently been flashing 
reports that Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov allegedly 
announced at a closed session of the State Duma that the 
Ministry of Defense is prepared, "if the government so decides," 
to transfer Navy and some Airborne Troops forces to the control 
of the Border Guards with a view to establishing mobile forces. 
But are you ready to receive them? 
  [Nikolayev] I think that you should ask Mikhail Petrovich 
himself to comment on this. As far as the Border Guards are 
concerned, we have our own niche; the Navy and the Airborne 
Troops do not fall within our remit; they have enough work of 
their own. 
  [Chernyak] The idea of separating the functions of the 
Ministry of Defense and General Staff is being widely touted. 
What is your opinion of this as a former General Staff officer? 
  [Nikolayev] Briefly, I would say that life has shown us that 
the General Staff should evolve into something else, that its 
functions should have been reexamined long ago with a view to 
expanding its role. An Armed Forces General Staff is necessary, 
but the General Staff is not the Ministry of Defense. 
  [Chernyak] What is your attitude to the military reforms 
being pursued by the Ministry of Defense? 
  [Nikolayev] No system can reform itself through its own 
efforts. In our country, however, the Army has been entrusted 
with this task. The result is natural. 
  [Chernyak] The issue of Russia's joining the "Partnership 
for Peace" program is so complex that even Minister Grachev has 
changed his viewpoint on this matter several times over the past 
month. What do you think of the expediency of rapprochement with 
NATO? 
  [Nikolayev] Russia should have special status -- I am 
convinced of this. After all, cooperation necessarily entails 
concessions. [Nikolayev ends] 
  Further comments by officers about their commander in chief: 
"A military intellectual in the true sense of the word." "A 
new wave has arrived with him which will not only renew the 
cadre composition of the High Command but will also encourage 
the idea of switching to a more civilized procedure for guarding 
the border." 
  [Chernyak] Andrey Ivanovich, not so long ago Boris Yeltsin 
made you a member of the Russian Federation Security Council. 
We have become accustomed to seeing Grachev, Yerin, or the 
state security chief on the Council, but this is the first time 
the chief border guard has been given a place. When you 
attended the first sessions, did you not feel a bit like an 
extra? 
  [Nikolayev] If we regard the state border purely in terms of 
the Border Guards, their commander in chief really has nothing 
to do on the Security Council. But you can look at it another 
way. I often come to work in "civvies," and what is more I do 
so deliberately. I try in whatever way I can to stress that in 
two or three or five years' time the Federal Border Service -- 
the Border Guards High Command -- is scheduled to become a 
service without a High Command: We began as soldiers, and we 
will complete our journey as an ordinary federal service. 
Guarding the state border is primarily a political matter. 
  [Chernyak] What, your stated aim is to disband the Border 
Guards? 
  [Nikolayev] That is not what I am saying: The role of the 
border service as a structure coordinating the activity of the 
departments working on the state border -- the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service, 
the Customs Committee, the immigration service, and others -- 
will expand, whereas the role of the military guard will shrink. 
We cannot of course entirely discard the military system of 
guarding the border. But we need to understand that nowadays 
this is no longer the basis for ensuring the security of the 
state's borders. After all, what image of the state border have 
we become accustomed to? Barbed wire, soldiers, dogs, "Halt, 
who goes there?" These days nobody needs this kind of state 
border. If we try to reestablish this kind of border, first of 
all people will tear it down, and second, we will lose not only 
our shirts but our underwear as well. For example, the length 
of Russia's border with Kazakhstan is 7,559 km. One kilometer 
costs 1 billion rubles. Merely to build the border itself -- 
without any infrastructure, housing, and so forth -- we would 
require 7.6 trillion, which is 150 percent more than all our 
current expenditure on maintaining the Border Guards. And what 
would the point of all that expenditure be? 
  We are making it our task to achieve cooperation with 
neighboring states for the purposes of combating criminal groups 
and preventing smuggling and illegal immigration. The border is 
both a sanitary checkpoint and a limit where we can confront 
forces engaging in intelligence activity. At the same time it 
should not be closed, and under no circumstances should it act 
as a barrier to goods, let alone people. Look: Approximately 2 
million people used to cross the USSR's borders [period not 
specified] on the way out of the country; nowadays 43 million 
people are entering the Russian Federation alone, and across the 
CIS as a whole the figure is approximately 200 million. Such 
border crossings are becoming the norm, because any law-abiding 
person quietly crosses the border at the designated crossing 
points. We only need to combat those who violate the procedure. 
I hope to see the day when the number of violations is reduced 
to a minimum: Not because we have started working more 
effectively, but simply because people realize that you do not 
have to resort to a violation in order to cross the border -- it 
is no longer the old-style border. We need to change people's 
psychology, but unfortunately this cannot be done overnight. 
  [Chernyak] What is your ideal state border? 
  [Nikolayev] Once, when I still had no idea of becoming a 
border guard, I was traveling in the vicinity of the 
U.S.-Canadian border; you only need a driver's license to cross 
it. But we should not look for the ideal as it exists in other 
countries. We should take a look to see which is best, but 
there is no need to copy it exactly. 
  [Chernyak] Do you intend to build a border with Ukraine? 
  [Nikolayev] In my view, Ukraine, Belorussia [Belarus], and 
Russia are a single people living in three independent states. 
But sovereignty is not a fence, even though many people may 
think so, taking the view that once you become a sovereign state 
you necessarily have to fence yourself off. The Belorussians 
were the first in the CIS to ensure Russia's interests on their 
borders -- we have mutual commitments, and also the right to 
carry out checks. We would like to build similar relations with 
Ukraine. If things work out, the border between our two 
countries will merely comprise border controls -- not five-km 
zones with border posts and troops -- and there will simply be 
checkpoints on the roads manned jointly by Russians and 
Ukrainians. This sort of border unites rather than divides. 
Sometimes we have to overcome opposition from people with 
antiquated views: They say that this has never been done on any 
state border. Well, so what? We will do it now. There is no 
formation quite like the CIS in the world either. 
  [Chernyak] How do you see the borders between the CIS and 
Central Asia developing in the future? 
  [Nikolayev] Kazakhstan, Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], Tajikistan, 
and Turkmenia are currently establishing their own border 
guards, and their role in guarding the border will increase. In 
the longer term, however, it would be expedient for Russia to 
have an operations group in the area which, besides 
participating in guarding CIS borders, will check that the 
commitments agreed to by these states are met. At present we 
pay half the cost of guarding these borders, but in the future 
we hope to reduce our share of the expenditure to nil: The 
interests of the Central Asian republics are being protected by 
Russia on the borders stretching from the Far East to Poland, 
and that is our contribution. 
  [Chernyak] Not so long ago you announced that the Border 
Guards have 58 generals -- an order of magnitude lower than than 
in the Army in proportion to the number of officers and enlisted 
men. Is this a deliberate policy? And what is your attitude to 
the abundance of generalships that are being awarded? 
  [Nikolayev] I am not happy with the word "abundance" in this 
context. We currently have 75 generals, and following the 
completion of the current stage of organizational development of 
the Border Guards we plan to have 145 generals' and admirals' 
posts -- new structures and Border Guards groups are being 
formed. Basically, the ratio of one general to 1,700-1,800 men 
seems fine to me, and the Ministry of Defense and internal 
troops, incidentally, have slightly fewer. The problem is 
something else entirely: We have a very large number of 
generals at the center, and also a great many people who have 
nothing to do with this rank, such as the chief military 
gynecologist. In my view, we should proceed first and foremost 
from a calculation of many people we actually need. [Nikolayev 
ends] 
  Further comments by officers about their commander in chief: 
"After reading an article in MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS criticizing 
the Border Guards in connection with the events on Tanfilyev 
Island, the commander made the following resolution on the 
matter: 'It is terribly upsetting, but everyone must face the 
truth.' He dislikes misrepresentation of facts, but he is not 
afraid of the truth." 
  [Chernyak] The Border Guards have always compared favorably 
with the Army -- primarily with regard to the atmosphere at 
border posts and the absence of bullying. Suddenly we are 
hearing reports to the contrary, and the Border Guards are 
virtually being portrayed as the chief offenders.... 
  [Nikolayev] Yes, discipline is on the wane, and this worries 
me a great deal. This year alone the number of irregular 
relationships has increased by over 150 percent compared to 
1993. Nevertheless I cannot agree with your premise that we are 
"leading the field." Besides, let us look at the heart of the 
problem. The crime situation in the country is getting worse 
and worse, and the Border Guards cannot remain in a vacuum. The 
Border Guards used not to accept draftees who had been arrested 
even once by the militia. Could we do that now? 
  [Chernyak] A number of rumors are circulating about the 
mysterious death in Tajikistan of Colonel Aleshinskiy of the 
High Command. Do you have any new information or alternative 
versions of the reasons for the tragedy? 
  [Nikolayev] This incident is unpleasant and difficult for 
the Border Guards. A suicide has taken place. As a specialist 
Aleshinskiy was a sensible and professionally trained officer. 
But unfortunately you do meet people in the military who have 
an alcohol dependency problem. 
  [Chernyak] Was the Far East "Putina-94" operation your idea? 
  [Nikolayev] Operations of this type will soon be put into 
effect on all Russia's seas. Everyone is keen to know whose 
idea it was. Write down that the president dreamed it up (he 
laughs). Basically, however, we have proposed something that has 
been in the air for a long time, and Boris Nikolayevich has 
backed us. After two-and-a-half years of lethargy, we need to 
begin rebuilding our national dignity. "Putina" is designed to 
let the people know that we have everything we need to defend 
our national dignity: the political will in the leadership, 
people who can make it happen -- talented, intelligent, and 
capable people -- and the necessary resources, provided that we 
do not squander them or sell them off right, left, and center. 
After all, we are not a nation in decline; we are great Russia.
