FT  21 MAY 92 / BR not at fault over most train door deaths
BRITISH RAIL was largely exonerated by the Health and Safety Executive
yesterday over the large number of deaths caused by passengers falling out
of the doors of moving trains.
At least 75 per cent of the deaths since 1984 were attributable to suicide
attempts, drunkenness or misbehaviour, the executive concluded.
Of the 25 per cent for which no explanation had been found, some may have
happened because door locks had jammed open or because doors had not been
properly closed, the executive said. It acknowledged that it had been unable
to link any of the deaths it investigated to either of those causes.
The investigation was launched last year because of public disquiet over the
165 train-door deaths between 1981 and 1990 - the largest single cause of
passenger fatalities over the period.
The executive concluded that a door lock properly engaged would never come
open during a journey in normal service. However, it established that in
certain circumstances, lock bolts could jam, and very slight pressure from
inside the train could cause the door to open.
A spot check of 140 doors had identified two in a dangerous condition, the
executive said. It criticised BR for not adopting maintenance procedures to
ensure the integrity of locks.
BR responded by saying that all slam-door InterCity trains would be fitted
with automatic locks over the next three years at a cost of Pounds 15m. It
said it had also improved maintenance procedures and was taking steps to
improve staff and passenger awareness of the importance of closing doors
properly.
