  [Abstract] Computations of the potential of a deuteron and 
the probability of the reaction of cold nuclear fusion of 
deuterium in the compound TiD[.sub]2[/] and in its alloys 
with elements of a 3d-period were made. The role of diffusion 
and phase processes in the synthesis of deuterium nuclei is 
statistically interpreted. On this basis a method is proposed 
for examining the state of a deuteron in a solid, making it 
possible to define a number of aspects which must be taken into 
account in subsequent research. In itself the solid is a 
significant factor reducing the Coulomb barrier of the deuteron. 
The screening effect itself is stable relative to the change in 
composition and external hydrostatic pressure, but does not 
ensure the probability of nuclear fusion even at the Jones 
level. Results are given providing a basis for assuming that the 
high mobility of deuterons in a solid, the band character of 
their motion and the active response to external fields are 
together capable of ensuring the necessary orders of the 
reaction rate. The formulation of a uniform model of cold 
nuclear fusion must therefore be based on the combined screening 
of d-d interaction under conditions when nonequilibrium 
processes prevail. Particular attention must be given to 
directed fluxes of deuterons along definite crystallographic 
directions for which resonance interaction effects are possible. 
The appearance of experimental data on buildup as a result of 
the cold nuclear fusion reaction of helium and tritium indicates 
that a solid also may exert an influence on the nuclear reaction 
mechanism itself. It is possible that a definite role in this 
case is played by steep gradients of electric fields already 
measured, for example, for palladium hydride. References 32: 16
