  [Text] Parliament is alarmed: The bosses are 
organizing their counterattack. Fresh shipments of arms come 
from the East. Mancino says: There are missiles and cannons in 
the Mafia families' arsenals. 
  Rome--"Cosa Nostra is not dead." Interior Minister Nicola 
Mancino thus shattered our illusions when he read the DIA's 
[Anti-Mafia Investigative Directorate] biannual report in 
Parliament. So, despite the successful hits it took last year, 
the Mafia alarm is still reading in the red alert zone. In fact, 
the Mafia families are allegedly reorganizing for their 
counterattack. 
  The interior minister's words leave no room for optimism. 
The 
recent massive seizures of arms confirm the fact that the Mafia 
clans still have "significant economic resources and means for 
intimidation and blackmail." And they are still able to 
influence the "life of entire local communities." This somber 
picture is composed of a number of elements. 
<H5>  900 in Handcuffs </H5>
  From 1 July to 17 December 1993, DIA investigations (carried 
out with a head count of 1,337 instead of the expected 1,457) 
led to 890 orders for precautionary arrest (524 members of the 
Mafia, 269 of the Camorra, 62 of the 'Ndrangheta, and 35 of the 
"sacred united crown.") At present, 103 operations are underway 
compared to 81 six months ago. 
  Some of the major causes for the prisoners' irritation with 
the state are the "restrictive measures imposed by Law 354/75 
which does not allow the Mafiosi special leaves, alternative 
forms of punishment, or the assignment to external work." 
  During the final days of 1993, they were able to completely 
reconstruct the 24 murders that had punctuated Toto Riina's rise 
to the Mafia's top leadership in the Cupola. 
<H5>  "Strategy of Terror" </H5>
  With the car bomb in Florence and the strikes on Milan and 
Rome in July, Cosa Nostra appears to have entered into a phase 
of pure terrorism. The purpose of deciding to hit symbolic 
targets, which are not connected with the activities not 
connected with judicial harassment, in unpredictable areas and 
situations, would be to "reaffirm to their followers the 
leadership of the top Cosa Nostra leaders who are now in prison." 
  This theory is supported by information obtained through 
wire 
taps in a "den" of fugitives and then by the suicide of the 
involuntary informer Antonino Gioe. The DIA believes that groups 
from Calabria, Campania, and Apulia worked together with the 
Mafia on these attacks. 
  A disturbing fact is that today the mob gangs "have access 
not only to automatic weapons but to military type explosives 
and self-propelling arms, such as missiles and recoilless 
cannons." For the most part, they come from the black markets of 
Switzerland, Croatia, and Russia. 
<H5>  The Falcone and Borsellino Cases </H5>
  Almost two years have gone by, but the DIA has not forgotten 
about "Mafia terrorism" at its highest symbolic level. According 
to the report, "the two massacres were characterized by the lack 
of any real sense of necessity or urgency. In addition to the 
objective of removing two dangerous enemies, the massacres 
served to reassure and to vindicate the men of honor sentenced 
to prison in the maxi-trial, whose sentences were almost all 
reconfirmed by the courts." 
<H5>  Rackets and Usury </H5>
  In the area of extortions, "the pressure brought to bear by 
the mob has not diminished. Racketeering continues to constitute 
a major source of illicit revenue." There has been an increased 
use of illicit funds in taking over industries and businesses. 
In 1992, in fact, 10 percent of commercial concerns were 
directly controlled by organized crime. In Sicily alone, there 
are allegedly 4,000 shops, restaurants, bars, mini-markets, and 
car dealerships with connections to the Mafia. 
  Just as serious, are the rising phenomena of usury (in the 
four regions where the "Mafia has its roots") and drug 
trafficking. 
<H5>  Politicians Targeted </H5>
  In the south, the Tangentopoli wave appears to be subsiding. 
The DIA reminds us that during 1993 34 municipal councils were 
dissolved because they had been subject to Mafia infiltration 
and influence: 10 in Sicily, two in Calabria, 17 in Campania, 
four in Puglia, and one in Basilicata. 
<H5>  The Mafia Abroad </H5>
  Mafia expansion still knows no boundaries. It has been known 
for some time that there are affiliates of the gangs from 
Sicily, Campania, and Calabria to be found in France, Germany, 
Canada, the United States, Australia, and South America. But now 
the Mafiosi are also investing in former East bloc countries. 
And by now hundreds of Italian criminals are visiting at the 
hotels of Moscow, who are interested in trafficking in drugs, 
counterfeit money, and works of art, and in laundering dirty 
money.
