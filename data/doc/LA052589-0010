THE WORLD 
Tokyo police reported searching the offices and homes of a Japanese machinery 
maker and its executives on suspicion that the company illegally exported 
sensitive nuclear reactor material to East Germany. The firm, Prometron 
Technics Ltd. of Tokyo, was suspected of exporting the material used for 
nuclear reactor control rods on several occasions between 1986 and 1987 in 
violation of international and domestic regulations. The material, known as 
hafnium, is a rare metal substance. News reports said the hafnium, which the 
firm imported from the United States, is used chiefly in military reactors 
aboard nuclear-powered ships.
