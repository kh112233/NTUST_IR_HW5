THE WORLD; 
BOMB KILLS 6 PERU SOLDIERS 
Leftist guerrillas bombed a bus carrying Peruvian government palace guards 
through downtown Lima, killing at least six soldiers and a police officer and 
wounding 24 other people. A car blocked the bus while it was en route to the 
palace, and two people maneuvered a pushcart loaded with explosives under the 
back of the vehicle and then detonated them, police said. The guards opened 
fire, but the suspects escaped. The government of President Alan Garcia, who 
lives at the palace, is fighting two leftist guerrilla organizations, the 
Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement.
