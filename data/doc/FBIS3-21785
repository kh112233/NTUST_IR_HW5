Substance? Pork Fat! No, Poppy Straw"] 
  [Text] According to analytical studies of drug-related 
crimes, Ukraine is increasingly becoming a producer of poppies. 
Today, it is one of the bases for opium-production raw 
materials among the CIS countries. As reported by Russian 
law-enforcement bodies, while in the first half of the last 
year, poppy straw [solomka] was mainly supplied from Baltic 
countries, at the end of 1993 it was almost entirely supplied 
from Ukraine. Estimates are in the thousands of kilograms. 
  As regards domestic consumption, in 1992, almost 10 tonnes 
of 
narcotics were confiscated in Ukraine; this amount has doubled 
this year [1993]. Drug abuse treatment centers have 38,000 drug 
addicts on their records.
