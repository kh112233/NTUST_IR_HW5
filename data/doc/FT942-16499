FT  09 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: A loss of choice that - Balanced
funds have lost their balance and tilted too much to equity income, says
John Cuthbert. And that is cause for concern to investors
This occasional series considers the risk/return trade-off of unit trusts.
The articles first select funds which do better than chosen benchmarks, then
relate the performance to the riskiness of the fund. This produces a
short-list of funds worth considering as investments.
Methodology: The total returns of funds operating in the same sector are
measured against that of the FT-SE-A All-Share index, the broadest measure
of the stock market. Those that beat it over five years - which is reflected
in a benchmark return of more than 1 in Table 1 - are then given a second
test: are they more or less risky than the norm for their sector?
If the figure under 'risk index' in Table 2 is above 1, they are unusually
risky; below 1, and they are less risky than the average. But then comes the
clincher: does their performance justify their risk profile?
The risk/return column in Table 2 takes the All-Share as the standard ; any
fund with a higher risk/return figure - that is, above 0.27 - is producing
an unusually good performance given its attitude to risk.
Funds with a risk/return figure below 0.27 do not produce a high-enough
return to justify the risks their managers take.
Some time during the 1980s, perhaps because of the equity headiness of those
days, the UK Balanced unit trust sector rid itself quietly of the
characteristic which had been its marker - a 50/50 mix of fixed income and
equity.
By the beginning of 1993, the process of favouring equity over fixed income
had gone so far that UK Balanced funds virtually were indistinguishable from
those of the UK Equity Income sector. Only one established fund, CU PPT
Monthly Income Plus, could claim any semblance of balance.
Is this loss of choice, the loss of fixed income and equity balance,
something we should mourn? I think it is.
Funds which mix fixed income with equities have two benefits over the more
fashionable approach of concentrating on equity income in the hope of
getting capital growth as well. First, fixed-income assets pay higher
yields. Second, funds based on balanced investment carry lower risk.
Those with at least some fixed income exposure are considerably less
volatile than pure equity funds. And, in general, the bigger the exposure to
fixed income, the lower the risk (as Table 1 shows).
Column one (average fixed-income content) of Table 1 shows the average
exposure of a sample of 19 Balanced unit trusts to fixed income assets for
the period from January 1 1989 to September 1 1993. Column two provides a
description of their equity volatility or risk over the same period.
The table shows a clear trend - Axa Equity &amp; Law and Perpetual High Income
aside - from the below-average risk of a high fixed-income element fund like
Prudential High Income to the high-risk, non-existent fixed-income exposure
of N&amp;P, NM and Brown Shipley.
But even the funds with a relatively high fixed-income content have gone
about it in arguably the wrong way. They have tended to concentrate on
preference shares and convertibles rather than bonds. Yet, bonds actually
are a better way of combining high income with low risk.
I could find only one fund (irritatingly, not included in the sample to
which I have just been referring), which has maintained a consistent mixed
exposure to bonds and equities - CU PPT Monthly Income Plus.
This fund has an outstandingly favourable combination of high yield and low
risk. It is the only fund included in my main study (Table 2) with a yield
(7.63 per cent) that exceeds that of the average gilt. Indeed, seven of the
funds in this study fail to beat the desperately low 3.44 per cent yield on
the All Share index.
CU's risk level also is well below average (its risk index figure is 0.66,
or 34 per cent below the sector average), whereas the risk profiles of the
rest of the sector range from average to high.
The sector's avoidance of fixed income in general, and bonds in particular,
would be understandable if the resulting increased exposure to equities had
produced greater capital gain. But as the total return column of Table 2
shows, there are no fewer than 11 funds with performances that fail to beat
the 53.33 per cent total return of CU PPT Monthly Income Plus. A further
seven fail to beat the five-year total return of the FT-SE-A All-Share
index.
The snag with CU is that its total performance record does not outstrip the
All Share index, either, whereas six other balanced funds have. But the
performances of each of these six have been at the expense of income, and
three (Perpetual High Income, Henry Cooke - previously Arkwright - Income
and N&amp;P Higher Income) also have required investors to accept above-average
or high levels of risk (see risk index figures).
With the exception of Perpetual High Income, none of these performances
stands out in a total return and risk-adjusted return comparison with the
Equity Income sector - which is where they should, in fact, reside. Chagrin
at the diminution of investor choice is increased by the realisation that
the switch from a balanced to a growth-biased equity income strategy has
not, in general, produced any real benefits.
The failure of most UK Balanced funds to turn equity opportunity into equity
performance shows up in Table 2. Only six funds with five-year records have
been able to match or better both the total return (74.86) and risk/return
of the All-Share index (0.27)
These two yardsticks provide an exacting test of a fund manager's worth.
Success on both counts is prima facie evidence of managerial ability. And,
while CU PPT Monthly Income Plus fails on the total return count, the fact
that it has the highest risk/return score of all is, nonetheless, a further
commendation for the bond/equity balanced approach.

Key: Total return is the arithmetical sum of 60 month-on-month offer
to offer price, net income re-invested, percentage change from January
30 1989 to January 30 1994. *Based on 56 monthly returns. Yield is the
percentage quoted yield. The benchmark return expresses each fund's
total return as a ratio of the FT-SE-A All Share's return of 74.86.
Risk index expresses each fund's measure of risk or volatility as a
ratio of the sector's average risk of 4.08. Risk is measured by the
population standard deviation of each fund's 60 monthly returns to
January 30 1994. Risk/return is the product of the arithmetical
division of each fund's average monthly total return divided by the
standard deviation of its monthly returns. The All-Share has been
adopted as a performance standard. Funds which have beaten the All
Share on the basis of total return (74.86) and risk/return (0.27) have
been shown in bold. All returns data: HSW. All calculations: JP
