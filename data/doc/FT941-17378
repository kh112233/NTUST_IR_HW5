FT  05 JAN 94 / Offer to clear Falkland mines
Argentina has offered to fund the clear-up of about 30,000 mines still
littering the Falkland Islands 12 years after the conflict with Britain,
writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
Mr Guido Di Tella, foreign minister, said Argentina would pay an
unidentified 'third country' to remove the mines, which dot large swathes of
land outside Port Stanley, the islands' capital. A Foreign Ministry official
said this might be done in co-operation with the UN.
British officials have welcomed the offer 'in principle' but said it raised
complex questions. They noted that Argentina kept no maps of minefields or
records of the quantity of mines laid.
Furthermore, the plastic mines are difficult to detect, and their detonators
deteriorate with time, making explosion unpredictable.
The offer is part of Mr Di Tella's so-called 'charm offensive' to overcome
the Falklanders' deep suspicion of Argentina. He has broadcast to the
islands, met Falkland councillors in London and sent Christmas gifts to
inhabitants.
However, on Monday, the 161st anniversary of the British occupation of the
Falklands, the Foreign Ministry restated Argentina's 'inalienable rights to
sovereignty' over them.
