"Aleksandr Zaveryukha Denies Rumors That Russia Is Holding Talks 
With United States on Grain Purchases" -- from FINANSOVYYE 
IZVESTIYA section] 
  [Text] According to him the freeing of bread prices 
reduced consumption from 5 million to 2.8 million tonnes last 
year, since bread is no longer being used to feed livestock. At 
the same time he noted that distortions in pricing policy are 
leading to a situation whereby bread is being produced in Russia 
using a calculation of 200,000 rubles [R] for 1 tonne of wheat, 
even though agricultural producers are selling bread at R70,000 
per tonne. The vice premier also reported that as of today 
stocks of meat, butter, and sugar are concentrated at depots in 
large quantities. In Zaveryukha's opinion these products are 
unwanted because many food products have been imported into 
Russia.
