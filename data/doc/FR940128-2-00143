<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of the ``Food Code: 1993 Recommendations of
the United States Public Health Service/Food and Drug Administration'' (the 1993 Food Code). The 1993 Food Code consists
of model requirements for regulating the retail segment of the food industry to safeguard public health and to ensure
that the food is not adulterated and is honestly presented when offered to the consumer. The 1993 Food Code updates,
combines, and replaces three separate preceding models: The 1976 Food Service Sanitation Code; the 1978 Food and
Beverage Vending Code; and the 1982 Retail Food Store Sanitation Code. It covers management and personnel; food;
equipment, utensils, and linens; water, plumbing, and waste; physical facilities; poisonous or toxic materials;
and compliance and enforcement. This project was initiated at the recommendation of the Conference for Food Protection
(the Conference).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

FDA is responsible under section 311 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243) and 21 CFR 5.10(a)(2) and (a)(4),
and the statutory provisions cited therein, for providing assistance to State and local governmental jurisdictions
with respect to the prevention of communicable disease and the enforcement of their public health regulations. For
many years, FDA has used model food codes as one means of assisting the several thousand Federal, State, and local agencies
that have primary responsibility for regulating retail-level food establishments such as restaurants, institutions,
grocery stores, and food vending locations. The model codes that FDA has prepared are not Federal laws or regulations
and are not preemptive but are widely referenced, adopted, and applied at all levels of government. FDA periodically
updates and reissues the model codes.


FDA has determined that a new model food code revision is necessary for the retail segment of the food industry because
new technologies are being applied by the industry; new information about the nature, contributing factors, and
means of preventing foodborne illness have become available; and new approaches to inspection have been developed
since FDA last revised its three existing model codes on retail food. FDA has also concluded that there was a need to
combine the provisions of these codes into a single document because the traditional lines of demarcation between
the types of food operations covered by each of the separate codes, as well as between food service firms versus food
stores, have largely disappeared. Pursuant to this determination, FDA issued a notice in the 

Federal Register

 of April 13, 1987 (52 FR 11885), that announced the agency's plan to revise the retail food codes. In that notice, FDA
cited the problems that States were having with the model codes and the opportunities offered by a new unified code.
In the 

Federal Register

 of May 9, 1988 (53 FR 16472), FDA announced the availability for comment of a draft model Food Protection Unicode that
would update and combine the food protection and sanitation provisions contained in the separate model codes covering
food service, food vending, and retail food stores. Interested persons were given until August 8, 1988, to comment.
FDA subsequently extended the comment period until October 7, 1988 (53 FR 29953, August 9, 1988), in response to requests
from three trade associations, one State agency, and the Conference.
FDA received over 150 letters, each containing 1 or more comments, in response to the draft model Food Protection Unicode.
FDA considered each of the comments and modified the document as appropriate based on the information that it received.
Among the comments that FDA considered were those of the Conference, which were submitted after the Conference's
1992 meeting in Baltimore, MD.
The 1993 Food Code provides definitions of terms; standards for management and personnel, food operations, equipment,
and facilities; and guidance on food establishment plan review, permit issuance, inspection, restriction of infected
food employees, holding and examination of food, and permit suspension. This new combined model code also includes:
(1) New provisions covering management responsibilities and knowledge and employee health and practices; (2) a
new framework for the application of hazard analysis critical control point principles at the retail level; (3) a
variance procedure for approving food processing at the retail level; (4) enhanced and more flexible criteria for
safe time/temperature management of potentially hazardous foods; (5) new provisions pertaining to consumer information
and public disclosure; and (6) more comprehensive code enforcement provisions.
