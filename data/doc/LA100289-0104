'TRAFFICKER OF 1ST ORDER' FACES BOGOTA CHARGES 
The most important drug suspect seized since Colombia began a major drug 
crackdown six weeks ago will be flown to Bogota in a matter of hours to face 
drug smuggling charges, authorities said today. 
Evaristo Porras Ardila, linked to the powerful Medellin cocaine cartel, was 
being held in the southwestern city of Pasto after being deported Sunday night 
from Ecuador. 
The Department of Administrative Security said he will be flown to the capital 
and brought before a judge to face the smuggling charges. 
Not on U.S. List 
Porras is not on the list of 12 "most wanted" suspects whose extradition is 
sought by the United States. 
But Department of Administrative Security spokesman Diva Rojas said he is the 
most important drug suspect caught since the crackdown began Aug. 18. A Defense 
Ministry spokesman described him as a "trafficker of the first order." 
The Bogota daily newspaper El Tiempo said Porras was the administrator of the 
Medellin cartel's operations in southern Colombia, especially its Amazon jungle 
cocaine laboratories on the borders with Brazil and Peru. 
Ecuadorean authorities said Porras was deported Sunday night on grounds of 
having an expired visa and using falsified documents. 
They said Porras, who was arrested Wednesday in his Quito apartment, lived in 
Ecuador under an assumed name since 1987 and ran a Quito company that did 
foreign trade in farm machinery.
