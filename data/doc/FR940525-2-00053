SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of partially exclusive world-wide licenses
to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Application SN 07/030,073 (now abandoned), entitled ``Phosphorothioate
Analogues of Oligodeoxyribonucleotides as Inhibitors for Replication and Cytopathic Effects of HTLV-III Retroviruses
and Other Foreign Nucleic Acids'' and U.S. Patents 5,264,423, 5,276,019, and 5,286,717, each entitled ``Inhibitors
for Replication of Retroviruses and for the Expression of Oncogene Products'' to ISIS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of Carlsbad,
California and Hybridon, Inc. of Worcester, Massachusetts. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned
to the United States of America. 


The prospective partially exclusive licenses will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions
of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. These prospective partially exclusive licenses may be granted unless within 60 days
from the date of this published notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument establishing, to the satisfaction
of NIH, that the grant of the respective license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 or 37
CFR 404.7. 
The patent application and patents are currently coexclusively licensed to Gilead Sciences, Inc., Lynx Therapeutics,
Inc. and Gen-Probe, Inc. (and its included affiliate, Genta, Inc.). The NIH has determined that the terms of these
coexclusive licenses do not prohibit the grant of additional partially exclusive licenses. The NIH will give full
consideration to additional applications for licenses that demonstrate the applicant is qualified to develop and
commercialize the inventions in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR part 404. 
The patent application and patents disclose novel phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotide compositions which
can be used to prevent the replication of foreign nucleic acids in the presence of normal living cells, as well as to
inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic cells.
