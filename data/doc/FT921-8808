FT  15 FEB 92 / International Company News: VW expects to repeat 1990
earnings level
VOLKSWAGEN, the German motor group, said its group net profits for 1991
would only be around the level of the previous year and those of its parent
company would be lower as a result of new model and production costs.
The group's net profits in 1990 were DM1.1bn (Dollars 679m), a rise of 4.6
per cent.
In the first nine months of last year, earnings rose by 1 per cent to
DM628m, but pre-tax profits were 6 per cent lower at DM1.6bn. Like other
German companies, VW has been trying to cut its high costs and produce more
abroad.
VW, which has just brought out its latest Golf family car, said total
turnover was about DM77bn (Dollars 48bn) last year, a rise of 13 per cent.
Deliveries of VW, Audi, and Seat cars increased by 2.5 per cent to 3.13m
units. Including Skoda, the Czech concern in which VW owns 31 per cent and
has management control, the figure was 3.3m.
Czechoslovakia is one of the main areas in which VW plans to invest in the
1990s. Out of planned capital spending of DM51bn over the next five years,
Skoda will account for DM6.1bn. VW has added to its Czech involvement with
an assembly venture in Bratislava.
VW's investment plans span Mexico, Portugal, China, and Taiwan. It plans to
supply the US and Canada with favourably priced models, including the Golf,
from low-cost Mexico, where it will invest DM1.5bn.
VW benefited considerably from the sharp increase in car demand caused by
German reunification. Its domestic deliveries went up by 27.5 per cent to
nearly 1.2m vehicles, with sales of its Seat models nearly doubling.
Other markets were less positive. Hit by the recession, VW group deliveries
in the US slumped by 31 per cent to 109,000 cars. In South America, where VW
is a partner in the Autolatina joint venture with Ford of the US, sales in
Brazil and Argentina improved. Autolatina's sales were 3.6 per cent higher
at 285,000 units.
