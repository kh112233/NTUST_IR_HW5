  [Text] Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA) -- The Geneva-based Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species [CITES], a 
UN-sponsored animal conservation organization, has proposed that 
Taiwan step up controls on the management of rhino horn and 
tiger bone stockpiles. 
  In a letter to the Council of Agriculture, CITES recommended 
that all rhino horn and tiger bone held by individuals be placed 
under government control at an appointed venue. 
  The letter came about three weeks after CITES had sent 
officials to Taiwan on a fact-finding mission. A CITES 
committee voted 3-3 earlier this year to postpone trade 
sanctions proposed by Britain's Environmental Investigation 
Agency, which claimed Taiwan has only perfunctorily cracked down 
on the illegal trade of rhino horn and tiger bone. 
  However, Tang Hsiao-yu, a COA section chief in charge of 
conservation affairs, indicated Tuesday [28 December] that 
implementing the latest CITES proposal would be difficult 
because the government cannot force the public to surrender 
private property. 
  CITES suggested in its letter that the ROC add a provision 
to 
its existing wildlife conservation law mandating individuals to 
register any rhino horn or tiger bone they own, and that a 
special government agency be organized to crack down on trading 
of endangered species on the island. 
  It also proposed that the government strengthen coordination 
with other countries, including Mainland China, to combat 
smuggling of endangered species.
