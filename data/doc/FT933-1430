FT  24 SEP 93 / Drug majors voice dismay
US pharmaceutical companies expressed dismay yesterday at the health reform
plan. They warned that it could force them to cut spending on the
development of new drugs.
Drug stocks staged a small recovery, however, after their steep falls in
recent months on early indications of the shape of the Clinton plan.
Senior drug company executives generally expressed support for President
Bill Clinton's aims in reforming the healthcare system, but objected to the
price controls and forced rebates in the plan.
The proposal to monitor prices on new drugs, the requirement for drugs
companies to offer larger rebates to Medicare, and the overall cap on
healthcare spending, prompted the most dismay among leading drugs company
executives.
'New Medicare rebates would increase the corporate tax burden by billions of
dollars a year, taking money from new drug research budgets,' said Mr Ray
Egan, senior vice-president of Bristol-Myers Squibb. 'Research and
development would be less likely because it would be more difficult to
recover the costs associated with bringing a new drug to market.'
Schering-Plough warned: 'Rebates, rationing and global budgets - all a form
of mandatory price controls - pose a major threat to the continued viability
of the pharmaceutical industry. Such controls will inevitably curtail R&amp;D
risk-taking.'
The US drugs companies claimed that market pressure for lower healthcare
costs had already led to a sharp fall in drug price inflation, and that this
process should be allowed to continue unhindered by regulation.
All the leading US drug stocks rose yesterday, with the biggest gains seen
by Pfizer, up Dollars 2 to Dollars 62 1/2 , and Schering Plough, up Dollars
2 to Dollars 65 1/4 . But the rises come after declines which have wiped
about 40 per cent off the value of the biggest drug companies this year.
