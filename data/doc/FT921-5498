FT  04 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hunt fine-tunes council proposals -
Wales
MINOR CHANGES to the government's proposals for reform of the structure of
local government in Wales were announced yesterday.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said he planned to replace the existing
eight county councils and 37 district councils, with 23 unitary authorities.
Mr Hunt had originally planned for 19 unitary authorities, before
consultations with local authorities in Wales.
Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Wrexham, the biggest centres of population,
would become all-purpose authorities in the plan for ending the present
two-tier structure. Pembrokeshire, Montgomeryshire, Merionethshire and
Anglesey, all of which disappeared from the local government map in the 1974
reorganisation, are among the old counties which will be restored.
Mr Barry Jones, shadow Welsh secretary, dismissed the proposals as an
electoral diversion which would fail to prevent the return of a Labour
government committed to establishing a Welsh assembly and a larger number of
unitary authorities.
The proposals were welcomed by Mr Geraint Howells, Liberal Democrat MP for
Ceredigion and Pembroke North, but attacked by Mr Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru
MP for Caernarfon, who insisted that an elected Welsh parliament should have
the review of local government as its first remit.
Mr Hunt maintained that there was not a consensus for a Welsh assembly, and
recalled that when Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, opposed its creation
in 1979 he warned that it would lead to greater centralisation. The minister
said his proposals would return more power to people in local communities
without adding to the cost of local government.
