LAWYERS TOLD TO NAME CLIENTS WHO PAID CASH 
The Internal Revenue Service has served summonses on criminal defense attorneys 
around the country demanding that they reveal the names of clients who paid 
their fees with cash, an IRS official confirmed Tuesday. 
Lawyers argue that such disclosures would violate the fundamental right of 
attorney-client privilege. 
The attorneys were told to bring their financial records to IRS offices, said 
Miami attorney Neal Sonnett, president of the National Assn. of Criminal 
Lawyers. One lawyer served said an IRS agent told him that 900 lawyers were to 
receive summonses. 
"We have heard from enough lawyers around the country to recognize that it 
appears to be a nationwide assault upon criminal defense lawyers," Sonnett 
said. 
In October, the IRS sent letters to about 940 criminal defense attorneys 
requesting information on clients who paid them more than $10,000 in cash, 
Sonnett said. The letters, signed by Christopher J. Lezovich, an IRS official 
in Detroit, was sent to attorneys around the country giving them 30 days to 
identify the clients. It also included a warning that non-compliance would 
result in summonses. 
Lezovich confirmed Tuesday night that summonses had been issued. 
The IRS is acting under a disclosure law passed by Congress in 1985. The law, 
initially widely ignored, was aimed at exposing tax evaders, including major 
drug dealers who often transact business in cash.
