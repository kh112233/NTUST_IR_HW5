FT  10 MAR 94 / Scott queries Customs' methods in Matrix case
The role of Customs and Excise in investigating alleged breaches of export
regulations in the Matrix Churchill case was challenged yesterday by Lord
Justice Scott.
The judge questioned whether Customs had gained a sufficiently 'rounded
picture' of the facts of the case before prosecuting three businessmen for
illegally exporting defence-related machine tools to Iraq.
He was speaking after taking oral evidence from Mr Peter Wiltshire, senior
investigating officer in the Matrix Churchill case.
Mr Wiltshire told the inquiry that he and Customs lawyers prepared their
prosecution without taking statements from Whitehall officials directly
involved in the licensing arrangements for Matrix Churchill exports. He also
admitted that Customs either ignored or delayed circulating some
intelligence reports relevant to the case that had been provided by MI6.
These reports included details about the extent to which Matrix Churchill
businessmen had been supplying information to the intelligence services.
Mr Wiltshire said that he had gathered evidence that the Matrix Churchill
businessmen had deceived Department of Trade and Industry licensing
officials about the nature of the machine tools they were exporting. But the
judge said Customs had the responsibility to fully test the defence case -
that the machine tools had been exported with the tacit agreement of the
government.
The judge asked Mr Wiltshire: 'If the truth was that the DTI didn't mind . .
. shouldn't you have investigated the background to see whether this was
likely to be the case?' Mr Wiltshire said a trawl of official papers
convinced him that no one in government 'really knew' what Matrix Churchill
was up to.
The hearing continues today.
