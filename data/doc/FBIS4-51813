  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- The country's travel 
deficit is widening in "Visit Korea Year '94," Transportation 
Ministry officials said Tuesday. In the first quarter foreign 
tourists spent 799 million U.S. dollars here, a 12.4-percent 
rise, while Korean travelers shelled out 1.11 billion dollars 
abroad, up 22.9 percent. The result was a travel deficit of 315 
million dollars for the three months, up 60.7 percent from 196 
million dollars in the same period last year. The growing 
deficit was caused by a sharp increase in the number of Koreans 
traveling overseas. 
  In January-March, 735,000 Koreans went abroad, up 33.8 
percent, while 825,000 foreigners entered this country, up 20.1 
percent. The Transportation Ministry had hoped to even out 
travel revenue and spending at 4.2 billion dollars apiece this 
year, but tourism expenditure is likely to exceed revenue, the 
officials predicted.
