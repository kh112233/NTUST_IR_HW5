SWEDISH COURT LINKS ARAB TO PAN AM CASE 
A court affirmed Monday that a Palestinian facing charges here of murder in an 
unrelated case is also a suspect in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, and it 
approved the seizure of evidence in his apartment. 
Mohammed abu Talb, 35, is believed to be the first suspect to face a court 
proceeding in connection with the bombing of the jumbo jet on Dec. 21, 1988, 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people. 
"The court finds that Abu Talb is suspected in Scotland of murder or as an 
accessory to murder," the brief District Court ruling said. 
Clothing seized in the raid "can be presumed to carry importance for the 
investigation," it said. 
The court classified its hearing records as secret and ordered any evidence 
removed from Sweden to be returned when the investigation is completed. Abu 
Talb, listed in court documents as Abo Talb, appeared at a closed hearing 
Friday. 
A verdict in the case of Abu Talb and three other Palestinians is expected Dec. 
21. Their trial ended Nov. 15 on charges of murder and attempted murder in four 
bombings in Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Stockholm in 1985 and 1986. 
Jamila Mograbi, who is divorced from Abu Talb but still lives with him, denied 
that he was involved in the Pan Am bombing but would not discuss the other 
charges. 
Abu Talb is a former member of the Palestine Popular Struggle Front, a group 
based in Syria. 
Mograbi said three Scottish detectives and seven Swedish officers searched the 
apartment last week for clothing traceable to Malta, virtually emptying the 
closets and filling 15 plastic bags. 
Investigators are said to have identified clothing originating in Malta from 
the suitcase they believe contained the bomb that downed Pan Am Flight 103. 
That flight, bound for New York, switched planes in London.
