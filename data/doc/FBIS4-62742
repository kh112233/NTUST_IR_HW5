  [Text] A World Bank (WB) delegation has arrived in Tallinn 
for talks to discuss the terms of a 20-million-U.S.-dollar aid 
package to Estonia. 
  The visit is the fourth and probably the last one of its 
kind 
before a final decision on the loan is taken, WB representative 
in Tallinn Hillar Lauri told INTERFAX. The money to be allocated 
to the Estonian Government is to be later distributed among 
commercial banks. 
  The agreement on the 15-year loan at an annual 7.43 percent 
rate is to be ratified by the State Assembly, Estonian 
parliament. 
  The fund is intended to help local banks build up their 
basic 
assets and provide long-term credits to enterprises. 
  Lauri stressed that an increase in basic assets of the 
commercial banks will enable them to grant long-term credits to 
local plants and by definition, speed up economic stabilization. 
  At this point the country has 22 commercial banks. A minimal 
ceiling of 15 million Eesti Kroones (8 Kroones equal DM [German 
marks 1]) has been set up to help create new banks. This is to 
be increased by 10 million Kroones annually in the next two 
years. As a long-range prospect, the minimal ceiling is to be 
raised to 75 million Kroones which is a minimum that the 
European Union set up for private banks. 
  Earlier, Estonia borrowed $30 million from the World Bank to 
help reorganize its economy.
