  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Mitsubishi Electric Corp. 
has developed a method to create an extremly thin film of 
single-crystal fullerene (C60) that can be vapor-deposited on 
base materials for possible practical use in semiconductors, a 
company spokesman said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  He said that only much smaller crystals for scientific 
experiments have so far been made. 
  He said the 1 square-centimeter, single-crystal 15 
nanometer-thin (one nanometer equals one-billionth of a meter) 
film, made by using the so-called ionized cluster beam (icb) 
method, is highly resistant to heat and radioactivity and has 
the potential for integration. 
  Details of the discovery will be announced at an academic 
meeting on fullerene to be held Thursday in Tokyo. 
  Mitsubishi Electric found in early 1992 that the next 
generation of carbon materials could be used for semiconductors. 
  The spokesman said the company will now try to develop a 
transistor device using the fullerene thin film. 
  Analysts say the material may also be applied to optical 
materials and catalysts, he said.
