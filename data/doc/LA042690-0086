TRUCK BOMB KILLS 6 IN COCAINE CAPITAL 
A bomb hidden in a dump truck exploded Wednesday as a vehicle carrying 
anti-terrorist police passed by in Medellin, Colombia's cocaine hub, killing at 
least six people and wounding about 36, police said. 
Acting President Horacio Serpa immediately called an emergency meeting of the 
National Security Council. 
The bombing came at 8:30 a.m. as a truck crept by carrying 20 members of 
Colombia's anti-terrorist strike force. The blast destroyed a shoe store and 
half a dozen automobiles and collapsed the roofs on several small stores and 
houses. 
At least four civilians and two police officers were killed and 26 civilians 
and eight police officers wounded, Medellin Police Chief Humberto Camero said.
