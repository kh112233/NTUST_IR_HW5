  [Text] Foreign Minister Celso Amorim today met French 
ministers and entrepreneurs in Paris. He said that the 
objective of his trip was to strengthen bilateral exchange in 
the areas of technology and trade. 
  From Paris, Minister Celso Amorim will go to Pretoria, South 
Africa, to represent President Itamar Franco at the installation 
ceremony of African leader Nelson Mandela next week. 
  The foreign minister said that Nelson Mandela's electoral 
victory has great political importance for the world. 
  [Begin Amorim recording] This opens important economic 
prospects for Brazil. Two months ago we already sent a 
commercial mission to South Africa. It also opens up broader 
prospects for cooperation with the African continent as a whole. 
  I believe that his election will also be important for the 
Angolan peace process, which is an important objective for 
Brazil. It will also contribute to consolidating the peacemaking 
process in Mozambique. [end recording]
