PERU GUERRILLAS KILL 13 POLICE OFFICERS, TROOPS 
Maoist guerrillas, adding to a fresh wave of violence in the cocaine-producing 
region, killed 13 police officers and soldiers in a highway ambush in Peru's 
Upper Huallaga Valley, police said Wednesday. 
The valley, long beset by rampant violence and lawlessness, is the site of the 
world's biggest plantations of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
