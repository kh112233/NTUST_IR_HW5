Sheriff's deputies were investigating Sunday the theft of $450,000 worth of 
merchandise from a Westlake marketing company. 
Pre-printed computer checks, collectors' stamps and at least 325 sketches and 
paintings were taken from M&amp;T Marketing on Lakefield Road about 8 p.m. 
Saturday, when someone pried open the company's rear door, said Lt. Tony 
Ditzhazy of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
Nobody was in the building when the thieves broke in, Ditzhazy said. Police 
were alerted to the break-in by an automatic burglar alarm, but the thieves had 
escaped by the time deputies arrived, he said.
