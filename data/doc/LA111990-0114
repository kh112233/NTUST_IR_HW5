BUSH WILLING TO SEND EMERGENCY FOOD TO SOVIETS 
President Bush said today that he would be willing to provide emergency food 
supplies and humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union, saying, "I worry about the 
Soviet people during the bleak winter coming up." 
Bush made his suggestion in advance of a two-hour meeting with Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose country is reeling under political and economic 
turmoil. 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sunday that the United States has 
not been asked for food or money. But U.S. officials said last week that they 
are preparing contingency plans in case of a Soviet request. 
Bush, during a morning news conference with British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher, appeared sympathetic to the plight of America's onetime chief 
adversary. 
"We would always be open-minded on humanitarian aid if there's a real need 
there," Bush said. 
Although U.S. law limits direct economic aid to Moscow, Bush said the United 
States could help alleviate food shortages, for example. 
"And that's the right and humane thing to do as a country moves toward us and 
relations are greatly improved. And I would want to try to help," he said. 
Food rationing will begin next month in Leningrad, the country's second-largest 
city. Some smaller cities have been rationing for more than a year. In Moscow, 
some items such as sugar are restricted. The City Council is debating whether 
to issue coupon booklets.
