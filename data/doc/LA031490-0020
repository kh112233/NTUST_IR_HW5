SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
Operating engineers at Kelco, the nation's largest harvester of kelp, have 
ended a 10-day strike against the company. 
About 250 employees returned to their jobs Monday, one day after members of 
Local 501 of the International Union of Operating Engineers voted 
overwhelmingly to approve a new three-year contract, according to Steve 
Zapoticzny, manager of public affairs for Kelco. 
"We're obviously very happy to see them back, and things are back to normal 
now," said Zapoticzny, who declined to discuss specifics of the contract. He 
said management personnel had filled in for the striking workers and that the 
company lost no revenue. 
The operating engineers, whose wages averaged $13 an hour, were joined in the 
dispute by members of the machinists union, most of whom had honored the picket 
lines even though they had agreed earlier to a company contract offer.
