  [Text] The Tanaiste [deputy prime minister] has said Sinn 
Fein can't be involved in roundtable talks on the future of the 
north until there's a permanent cessation of violence. 
  Speaking in Dublin following talks with the British Foreign 
Secretary Mr. Hurd, Mr. Spring also said there are no 
indications that the IRA is considering a temporary cease-fire. 
Derek Cunningham reports: 
  [Begin Cunningham recording] Mr. Hurd arrived at Iveagh 
House 
in the company of the Tanaiste at around half past tenthis 
morning. The two men spent about an hour together and discussed 
a wide range of topics, including the present state of the peace 
process and the controversy over the enlargement of the European 
Union. 
  After the meeting, Mr. Spring said that--in relation to 
comments attributed to him at the weekend concerning an IRA 
cease-fire--there were no indications that the IRA are 
considering such a move. He said a temporary cease-fire would 
be welcomed by the communities in the north and would be 
encouraged by the government, but Mr. Spring said it was 
difficult to accept peace messages from Sinn Fein by day while 
mortar attacks like those on Heathrow Airport and Crossmaglen 
continued. 
  The British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the Downing 
Street Declaration was not a bargaining ploy but a robust 
statement of principle by the two governments. 
  Mr. Spring will accompany Mr. Hurd on a visit to Newgrange 
later this afternoon. Derek Cunningham RTE news, Iveagh House.
