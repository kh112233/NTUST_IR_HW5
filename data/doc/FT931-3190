FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Crossrail may be delayed
CROSSRAIL, the Pounds 1.7bn cross-London rail-link, could be delayed
following the chancellor's announcement yesterday that it would be a joint
venture between the public and private sectors. Work on the London
Underground-British Rail link was originally to start in 1995.
Mr Lamont also announced that the Pounds 300m Heathrow Express line (above)
and the Pounds 3bn channel tunnel high-speed rail link are to go ahead. The
15-mile Paddington-Heathrow fast link - a joint venture between BR and
airport operator BAA - will be started later this year.
