FT  17 NOV 94 / Landmine sale ban agreed by 22 states
An estimated 22 countries have reached a tentative agreement to ban
international sales of anti-personnel landmines, US officials said
yesterday.
Mr Ralph Earle, deputy director of the US arms control and disarmament
agency, said the agreement came at a meeting of officials working on a
successor to the co-ordinating committee on multilateral export controls
(Cocom), the cold war organisation created to stop the sale of military
technology to the former Warsaw pact.
'They're not addressing tank-killers, they're addressing baby-killers,' Mr
Earle said.
A ban on anti-personnel mine sales would be a first step towards meeting
President Bill Clinton's promise, in a speech to the United Nations general
assembly in September, to throw US weight behind UN efforts to eliminate
anti-personnel mines.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, has argued for much
tougher restrictions on anti-personnel landmines, of which US officials
estimate there are around 85m now scattered in 62 countries.
Discussions are afoot on installing self-destruction devices to prevent such
mines from continuing to claim civilian lives for years after the war in
which they were originally spread.
The Cocom group includes members of Nato as well as Japan, New Zealand and
European non-Nato members such as Ireland and Sweden, but it was dissolved
earlier this year in recognition of the end of the cold war.
Russia wants to join in the regime that succeeds Cocom, which would be aimed
principally at stopping the export of military technology to what the US
calls 'outlaw nations' such as Iran and Iraq.
