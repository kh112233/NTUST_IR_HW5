  [Excerpt] By three votes to one, the First Chamber of the 
Appeal Court has issued the final ruling on the case involving 
Basques. It upheld the extradition of Jesus Maria Lizarralde 
Izaguirre, who was indicted for causing damage and destruction, 
illegal association, and illegally taking hostages. [see 22 
March Terrorism Report for previous reporting on this issue] 
  Uruguayan justice has thus granted three extraditions to its 
Spanish counterpart. 
  The Basques who will be extradited are: Jesus Maria 
Lizarralde -- whose extradition was granted yesterday -- Jesus 
Goitia Unzurrunzaga, and Mike Ibanez Oteiza, all of whom are in 
custody at the Central Police Precinct jail. 
  The extradition requests on Pedro Maria Gomez, Jesus Lariz, 
Juan Jose Urrutia, and Amaia Araqustain, was rejected by a 
hearing court and upheld by the Appeal Court. 
  By three votes to one, the Appeal Court rejected Mirem 
Argutzane Delgado Iriondo's extradition, thus overturning a 
ruling by a hearing court. They were released. 
  The extradition of the three Basques who have been charged 
by 
the Spanish Government with belonging to the ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty] will not take place right now since they 
-- together with the other five who have been released -- have 
pending lawsuits under way here for the use of false documents.
