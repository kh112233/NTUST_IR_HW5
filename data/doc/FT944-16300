FT  14 OCT 94 / Japanese wins literature prize
Mr Kenzaburo Oe yesterday won the Nobel prize for literature, becoming only
the second Japanese writer to receive the world's most prestigious literary
award. Mr Oe's achievement lay in 'creating an imagined world where life and
myth condense to form a disturbing picture of the human predicament,' said
the Swedish Academy of Letters. Yasunari Kawabata was the previous Japanese
prizewinner in 1968. Last year the female Afro-American novelist Toni
Morrison won the award.
