FT  06 FEB 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Telephone selling
plan on the line
A draft proposal placing severe restrictions on the use of telephones, faxes
and other electronic devices to market goods and services, has fallen by the
wayside in its passage through the European Commission.
The now-junked 'distance selling' directive would have required prior
consumer consent before a company could approach the customer via any form
of electronic communication.
That would probably have rendered many forms of currently legitimate UK
business activity both more expensive and cumbersome.
Some in the direct marketing field argue that it would have doomed their
activities entirely.
The scheme was rejected on January 23 and is unlikely to re-surface without
substantial liberalising changes. According to the UK Advertising
Association, the distance selling directive has 'fallen victim' to the
Maastricht agreement on subsidiarity.
This promulgated the principle that legislation should be implemented by the
lowest level of government.
But one important implication of the rethink is that the equally restrictive
draft on data protection - which closely reflects the German practice of
severely curtailing the gathering of personal information - is also likely
to fail to win approval.
Direct marketing of all forms, including distance selling, in the UK
accounted for some Pounds 1.86bn of advertising expenditure in 1990, while
direct mail agencies grew by 17 per cent during a year when advertising
generally was in steep decline.
The Advertising Association is claiming that it and its fellow European
lobbyists have brought about a sea-change in the thinking of EC officials,
weaning them off an inclination towards heavily-protective consumer
legislation.
