FT  04 AUG 93 / Call waiting, for the lucky few: Eastern Europe's biggest
barrier to exports is its poor telecoms system
For every person with a telephone in Albania, six are on a waiting list. It
is better in Hungary and Poland, where there are about three in the queue
for every five installed.
Without a modern telecommunications system, east European business will be
hampered at every turn. But with existing levels of investment, its chances
of getting one in the foreseeable future are slim.
A few further figures underline the region's plight. Western Europe has an
average of 43 exchange lines per 100 people. In the east, only the Baltic
states and Bulgaria have more than 20 per 100, while the rest of the region
has between 10 and 15 per 100.
According to a recent survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, east European business considers inadequate
telecommunications to be its biggest infrastructure barrier to exports. In
Poland poor telecommunications is a more frequently cited obstacle than any
other, including exchange rates and the instability of the banking sector.
CIT Research, a London communications consultancy, estimates the cost of
providing Russia and eastern Europe with the same density of exchange lines
as Spain has today - 35 per 100 people - at Dollars 129bn, or Dollars 14.3bn
a year if it were spread equally from 1992 to 2000.
The Spanish target, a rough yardstick, is far beyond the medium-term reach
of most countries in the region. According to CIT, if the telecoms growth
rate of 1988-91 were sustained, only the Baltic states and Bulgaria would
reach the Spanish target by 2000, while Russia would end the decade with 24
lines per 100, the former Czechoslovakia with 25, Hungary 20, Ukraine 18 and
Poland 14.6.
To reach 35 per 100, Poland needs an extra 10m exchange lines, at a cost of
about Dollars 20bn. Last year, according to BIS Strategic Decisions, a UK
consultancy, only Dollars 1.3bn was invested, barely half the funds needed.
To put the figures in perspective, telecoms investment in the UK will amount
to about Dollars 5bn this year, enhancing a network that already provides 45
lines per 100 people.
Western private sector capital has so far played a negligible role in
eastern Europe telecommunications. 'There are some joint ventures between
eastern and western operators, but few are in wireline services and they
constitute a very small proportion of total investments so far,' says CIT.
Criticism of international lending institutions is widespread, and not just
in the east. 'Investment is falling drastically short of necessary levels,'
says Mr Andres Bande, president of Ameritech International, the US operator.
He claims that, since the 1960s, the World Bank has lent barely Dollars 5bn
on telecommunications projects worldwide and that only 2 per cent of its
current lending is for telecoms, down from 3.6 per cent 20 years ago.
Between them, the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development have so far lent barely Dollars 1bn for
telecoms projects in eastern Europe in the past two years.
'The World Bank should look upon central and eastern Europe as it looked
upon western Europe and Japan in the years immediately after the second
world war,' says Mr Bande. He would like to see the establishment of an
international body, called 'Worldtel', exclusively targeted at
telecommunications development.
The World Bank and the EBRD reject the criticism. 'What we need is not
Worldtel but greater private sector involvement,' says Mr Edouard Wylleman,
senior infrastructure project manager at the EBRD. 'Our job is largely to
create the conditions for that - particularly by promoting an appropriate
legal framework and pioneering new financial instruments.'
Even if Worldtel were established, its financial contribution to eastern
Europe's telecoms could only be modest. BIS estimates that only about 10 per
cent of the funds needed to upgrade the region's telecoms could reasonably
come from the multilateral lenders; the rest would have to come from
internal sources (55 per cent) and from foreign direct investment (30 per
cent).
Increased internal revenue will have to be generated largely by reforming
tariff and staffing structures to reflect costs. Faced with strong political
pressures, progress on both fronts is slow. Across the OECD, the average
ratio of installed lines to employees is 120; in eastern Europe it is
between 30 and 50. On tariffs, the picture is more mixed. Russia, for
instance, has deregulated prices; but with inflation rampant, revenue is far
below that needed to fund expansion.
Privatisation of the region's state-controlled telecoms operators is the
most likely source of substantial inward investment - supplemented by
franchise contracts for new data and cellular mobile networks, and perhaps
also for mainline network expansion.
Mr Charles Jonscher, president of the Central Europe Trust, a UK-based
consultancy, is confident that capital requirements will force the region
rapidly down the privatisation and franchise roads. He sees a three-phase
process. A monopoly of investment and service-provision by state
telecommunications utilities is giving way to joint ventures with overseas
partners. In due course he expects the state utilities to be sold, with
competition encouraged between operators.
The three phases are evident in the development of the region's cellular
mobile networks. In most countries, the first generation of cellular
networks was provided by single joint ventures between state and foreign
operators. By contrast, competing concessions are being offered for new
digital networks constructed to the pan-European GSM standard.
For entrepreneurs prepared to pay premium rates, mobile and satellite links
are developing fast. However, for mass telecommunications at affordable
prices, expanding the basic fixed network is the overriding priority. In
that sphere, progress towards Mr Jonscher's second and third phases of joint
ventures and privatisation is painfully slow in most countries.
Ideological opposition to privatisation and liberalisation remains strong.
At a recent FT conference, Mr Krzysztof Kilian, Poland's telecommunications
minister, said the (now interim) government had just 'started to think'
about privatising part of Polish telecoms. He expressed deep scepticism as
to the value of competition in basic network provision. 'Surely it is
obvious that costs will be lowest in high-capacity systems in the hands of a
single operator,' he said.
Privatisation is proceeding in Hungary, along with provision for licensing
56 regional competitors to the former monopoly. Thirteen overseas operators
have submitted proposals to take a stake in the Hungarian company, including
several leading west European and US operators.
But even if the rest of eastern Europe follows Hungary's lead, the source of
future inward investment is problematic. Companies with a total
capitalisation of Dollars 50bn are expected to come to market over the next
three years in the Asia Pacific region, where telecoms expansion is riding
on the back of buoyant economies. Then there is western Europe, where a
privatisation avalanche starts in 1995-96 with the sale of Deutsche Telekom.
'We are facing a real shortage of capital to get the industry moving in
eastern Europe,' says Mr David Wheeler, a corporate finance director at
Lehman Brothers, the merchant bank. 'It is not just rival flotations:
successful privatisations in eastern Europe will need dedicated strategic
partners, and they are in increasingly short supply.' Deutsche Telekom has a
particularly strong interest in the region, but with a DM70bn (Dollars
40.8bn) bill for modernising the network in the eastern German Lander, it
has little spare cash.
If that seems unduly gloomy, the Asia Pacific region might offer an
alternative model. There, economies took off and advanced telecommunications
are following. Alas, there is no sign of such a take-off in eastern Europe -
with or without the telephones.
