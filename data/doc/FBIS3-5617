  [Text] Tokyo, March 9 KYODO -- Cambodian First Prime 
Minister Norodom Ranariddh expressed his sympathy Wednesday [9 
March] for the loss of Japanese lives during the U.N. 
peacekeeping operation in Cambodia last year, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  The officials said Ranariddh made the remark in a meeting 
with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  "I offer condolences for the two Japanese youths who lost 
their lives in the context of Japan's international 
cooperation," he was quoted as saying. 
  The reference was to Atsuhito Nakata, a Japanese U.N. 
volunteer election worker shot to death last April, and Haruyuki 
Takada, a civilian policeman killed last May in an ambush. 
  Meanwhile, a Cambodian newspaper Tuesday reported having 
received a message from King Norodom Sihanouk in Beijing in 
which the ailing monarch said he would receive the Nakata family 
at a special audience at the royal palace in Phnom Penh on May 9. 
  The Cambodia daily report said King Sihanouk praised 
Nakata's 
"immense courage and extraordinary contribution at the cost of 
his life to secure a free election and help set the foundation 
for democracy." 
  Takehito Nakata, Atsuhito's father, has retired from his 
post 
at Tomen Trading Co. to promote overseas volunteer activities. 
He has been named an honorary U.N. volunteer ambassador.
