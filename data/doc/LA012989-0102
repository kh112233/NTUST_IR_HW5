THE STATE 
A Marine accused of killing his wife and faking her suicide by hanging was 
freed after a military prosecutor recommended that charges be dropped because 
the woman probably had killed herself. Gunnery Sgt. Murray Payne, arrested Dec. 
1, was released from the brig at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station after a 
two-week hearing into the May 10, 1988, death of Ella Mae Payne at the couple's 
Corona home. Maj. R.W.J. Grove, who presided over the hearing, said he would 
evaluate the case for a week before recommending to the commanding general 
whether Payne should or should not face charges.
