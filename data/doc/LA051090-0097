POT GROWERS WHO ADVERTISED ARE SENTENCED TO PRISON TERMS 
Two La Mesa residents have been sentenced to federal prison for their roles in 
a marijuana production ring that was investigated after one defendant 
advertised her firm in "High Times" magazine. 
Albert James McCormick, 44, was ordered Tuesday to serve 18 months in prison, 
and Patricia Lynn Chu, 26, was sentenced to one year. 
Both pleaded guilty in March to conspiracy to manufacture marijuana with the 
intent to distribute. 
A third defendant in the case, Joseph M. Elliott, 35, was convicted of the same 
charge and one count of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, 
according to Assistant U. S. Atty. Amalia L. Meza. She said Elliott could be 
given a maximum term of 40 years when he is sentenced May 14. 
Drug Enforcement Administration officials began an investigation of the three 
after Chu's company, Early Pearl Garden Supply in San Diego, advertised the 
sale of hydroponic growing equipment in "High Times" magazine. 
The magazine often publishes features on marijuana, and hydroponic equipment is 
used to grow plants without soil.
