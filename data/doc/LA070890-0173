NATION IN BRIEF; 
MASSACHUSETTS; 
LEGISLATURE PASSES BIGGEST TAX HIKE 
The Massachusetts Legislature enacted the largest tax hike in state history, a 
$1.3-billion combination of income, sales and gasoline levies designed to 
revive the flagging "miracle" touted by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. The 
measure was enacted on an 80-75 vote in the House before winning final approval 
in the Senate by a 20-16 margin. 
It heads to the desk of Dukakis, an ardent supporter who aides said may sign 
the measure during the weekend. The final votes, which came shortly before 4 
a.m. in Boston, ended a marathon session. Angry Republicans and tax hike 
opponents said supporters of the measure would face retribution at the polls. 
The measure could also be undone by a ballot initiative designed to roll back 
the more than $2 billion in higher taxes and fees approved since 1988, when 
Dukakis campaigned for the White House on his ability to balance 10 state 
budgets.
