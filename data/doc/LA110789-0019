MORNING REPORT: ART 
Picasso Artworks Stolen: The granddaughter of famed artist Pablo Picasso has 
been robbed of art works valued at $17 million in what French police call one 
of the biggest art thefts ever. Police declined to reveal the exact number or 
titles stolen Sunday from Marina Picasso's villa in Cannes, but did confirm 
that they included two paintings by Henri Matisse, a bust by Auguste Rodin and 
some works by her grandfather. The break-in took place while Picasso was on 
vacation in Megeve and a housekeeper was out shopping. Picasso returned to 
Cannes on Monday but declined to speak to reporters who had gathered at her 
three-story villa. Picasso inherited the works from her grandfather, who died 
in 1973. ALEENE MacMINN
