  [Abstract] The scarcity of data on the efficacy of 
antibiotics against an agent form incapable of producing a 
capsular antigen (fraction I) or agent versions with the 
Fra[.sup]+[/] phenotype which are isolated in exotic foci and 
can induce disease in humans necessitated a study of the 
preventive action of tetracyclines, primarily doxycyclin, 
against the plague infection induced by a fractionless agent 
version. To this end, the Yersinia pestis 231 (708) 
strain and its fractionless versions 231 Fra[.sup]-[/].1 and 
Fra[.sup]-[/].2 are used whereby 18-20 g albino mice are 
subcutaneously infected with suspensions of agar cultures. The 
plague microbe strain's sensitivity to tetracylines is 
determined in vitro. The efficacy of doxycyclin and 
tetracycline in the prevention of experimental albino mice 
plague induced by a 100 g/kg injected dose of Y. 
pestis 231 and 231 Fra[.sup]-[/], a comparative analysis 
of the ED[.sub]50[/] values for doxycyclin against 
experimental plague in albino mice infected with Y. 
pestis 231 and 231 Fra[.sup]-[/] (1,000 
LD[.sub]50[/]) by injection, and the preventive efficacy of 
injected doxycyclin against experimental albino mice plague 
induced by Y. pestis 231 and 231 Fra[.sup]-[/] 
(1,000 LD[.sub]50[/]) are summarized. The study shows that 
neither an increase in the daily dose, nor an increase in the 
treatment duration ensured a high preventive treatment 
efficiency against fractionless plague agent versions, probably 
due to a change in the infectious process development. The 
conclusion is drawn that doxycyclin--a prolonged semi-synthetic 
tetracycline preparation--has a lower therapeutic efficiency 
against experimental plague in albino mice induced by a strain 
deprived of the ability to produce fraction I; this is 
manifested by higher ED[.sub]50[/] values and lower 
LD[.sub]50[/] values of this preparation against the backdrop 
of treatment and a lower percentage of animals surviving after 
intensive antibiotic therapy. The importance of taking into 
account the possibility of a decrease in the tetracycline 
efficiency for an infection induced by a fractionless agent 
version in developing treatment and prevention procedures is 
stressed. Tables 3; references 10: 6 Russian, 4 Western.
