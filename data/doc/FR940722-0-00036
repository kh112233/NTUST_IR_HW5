I. Background and Estimates of Consumption


In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of January 26, 1988 (53 FR 2093), which was amended in the 

Federal Register

 of June 9, 1988 (53 FR 21729), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 7A3998) had been filed by Pfizer, 235
East 42d St., New York, NY 10017, proposing that 172.841 

Polydextrose

 (21 CFR 172.841) be amended to provide for the safe use of polydextrose in peanut spread. In a notice published in the


Federal Register

 of May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19046), FDA announced that another food additive petition (FAP 8A4068) had been filed by Pfizer,
proposing to amend the same regulation for the safe use of polydextrose in fruit spreads. Then, in a notice published
in the 

Federal Register

 of March 15, 1989 (54 FR 10727), the agency announced that Pfizer had filed a third food additive petition (FAP 9A4126),
proposing to amend the same regulation for the safe use of polydextrose in sweet sauces, toppings, and syrups. In a
notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of November 18, 1992 (57 FR 54406), FDA announced that the agency was amending the filing notices for three food additive
petitions (FAP's 7A3998, 8A4068, and 9A4126) filed by Pfizer, dated January 26 and May 26, 1988, and March 15, 1989,
respectively, to state that the petitioner had requested that 172.841 be amended to include, through incorporation
by reference, specifications of the ``Food Chemicals Codex,'' 3d ed. (1981), 2d supp. (1986), pp. 57 through 59, and
3d supp. (1992), p. 136.
The agency has estimated that the proposed uses of polydextrose in peanut spread, fruit spreads, sweet sauces, toppings,
and syrups would add no more than 4.2 grams per person per day (g/p/d) to the mean and 4.6 g/p/d to the 90th percentile
estimated daily intake (EDI) for the 2- to 5-year age group and 3.2 g/p/d to the mean and 4.1 g/p/d to the 90th percentile
EDI for the 2+ years age group (all ages). Upon regulation, the cumulative EDI will be no greater than 16 g/p/d for mean
consumption and 26 g/p/d for consumption at the 90th percentile for the 2- to 5-year-old-age group and 18 g/p/d (mean)
and 29 g/p/d (90th percentile) for the ``all ages'' age group (Ref. 1).


II. Lead Specification for Polydextrose


The agency has been attempting to reduce consumer exposure to lead in foods by revising or setting new lead specifications
for food additives. (See 59 FR 5363, February 4, 1994). During the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC) Committee workshop on
May 2, 1991, the agency presented its concerns regarding lead levels in food additives. The FCC Committee of the National
Academy of Science/Institute of Medicine thereafter revised its policy for establishing lead specifications for
food additives to require that lead specifications should be set at the lowest levels practicable on the basis of:
(1) Current good manufacturing practice; (2) potential hazard; (3) the availability of analytical methodology
for the determination of low lead levels in food matrices; and (4) estimates of food intake. Revised and new lead specifications
have recently been published for a number of food ingredients in the ``Food Chemicals Codex,'' 3d ed., 3d supp. (1992).
In amending the current regulation for polydextrose (21 CFR 172.841), the agency is incorporating by reference the
specifications for polydextrose set out in the ``Food Chemicals Codex ,'' 3d ed., 2d supp. (1986), as amended by the
3d supp. (1992), including the new lowered specifications for lead (0.5 parts per million (ppm)) as well as that for
heavy metals (as lead) (5 ppm).


III. Conclusion


The agency concludes that the available data provide reasonable certainty of no harm from the proposed food additive
uses. In reaching this conclusion, the agency has considered the potential for excessive consumption of polydextrose
to cause laxation effects in sensitive individuals. 21 CFR 172.841(d) currently requires that consumers be informed
of this potential through special labeling of products containing more than 15 g of polydextrose per serving. The
agency has considered the cumulative effect of the additional petitioned uses and has concluded that the current
labeling requirement is adequate to protect the public. Accordingly, the agency is amending 172.841 of the
food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of polydextrose in peanut spread, fruit spreads, sweet sauces,
toppings, and syrups. 
In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petitions and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petitions are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.


IV. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment for each of the three petitions, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address
above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.


V. Objections


Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before August 22, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.


VI. Reference


The following reference has been placed on display in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) and may be seen
