  [Text] Three-way negotiations between representatives of 
the Estonian government, employers and employees ended with the 
signing of a protocol which establishes a minimum hourly wage 
effective as of Aug. 1. 
  Economics Minister Toivo Jurgenson said the wage was set at 
2.65 kroons. As Viljar Veskivali, the chairman of the Estonian 
Industry Association, said, this means that, beginning with 
August, employers must pay not less than 2.65 kroons for an 
hour's work. 
  Veskivali said the negotiating parties agreed in principle 
that pensions must not be tied to the minimum hourly wage. 
  The parties also agreed that the unemployment benefit must 
be 
smaller than the official subsistence level, which at present 
stands at 280 kroons per month, Jurgenson said. 
  "We must give maximum encouragement to working," the 
minister 
said. "But we didn't as yet get down to concrete sums in 
connection with unemployment benefits." 
  Veskivali said the signed protocol stipulates that the 
government must reach agreement with employers and employees on 
legislation raising the tax burden before sending it for 
consideration in the parliament. Also, the government cannot 
under the agreement unilaterally put up the price of electric 
energy.
