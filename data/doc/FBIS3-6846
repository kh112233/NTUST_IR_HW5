  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- A team of researchers at 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) said Tuesday [22 
March] it has developed a new thin film for possible use in a 
magnetic disk with the memory capacity nearly 100 times that of 
conventional ones. The researchers made the breakthrough by 
discovering a magnet with a diameter of 8 nanometers 
(one-billionth of a meter), contained in a cobalt-chrome alloy 
crystal, they said. 
  Conventional magnetic films are made up from an alloy 
crystal 
60 nanometers in diameter, according to the researchers. 
  The discovery of the new alloy film is expected to pave the 
way for the production of the increased capacity magnetic disk, 
the primary storage medium for computers, which they said will 
be put into practical use in a few years. 
  The current magnetic disk with a diameter of 2.5 inches has 
a 
memory capacity the equivalent to 10-day's volume of a major 
Japanese-language morning newspaper.
