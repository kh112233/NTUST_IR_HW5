RECALLING THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD AFTER; 
100 YEARS 
A century later, Elsie Frum remembers vividly the steady, shrill whistle of 
warning and the horrifying wall of water that killed 2,209 people in the 
Johnstown Flood of 1889. 
"My father ran into the house and said: 'Run! The dam has broken!' And we ran. 
We just got out in time," Mrs. Frum recalls. 
"It was terrible. It sounded like thunder. It took everything, everything in 
front of it -- railroad engines, the roundhouse. It took all the buildings. It 
looked like an ocean. 
"Then there was nothing left. It was like a beach when it was over. We just 
stood there and watched it. Everyone was stunned. We didn't know what to do." 
Mrs. Frum, 106 years old and a great-great-grandmother, is the last known 
survivor who remembers the flood of May 31, 1889, the first of three floods to 
devastate this western Pennsylvania mountain city and nearby villages. 
One of the five worst natural disasters in U.S. history, the Johnstown Flood of 
1889 was caused by the collapse of the South Fork Dam about 15 miles northeast 
and 450 feet above Johnstown. 
The 72-foot-high earthen dam held a private lake for the exclusive summertime 
recreation of such 19th-Century industrial barons as Andrew Carnegie, Henry 
Clay Frick and Andrew Mellon. Experts said 
later it was weakened by poor maintenance and extraordinarily heavy rains of up 
to 10 inches in 24 hours. 
The dam's collapse sent a 35- to 80-foot surge of water racing down the narrow 
Little Conemaugh River Valley, sweeping away houses, barns, railroad cars and 
locomotives, telegraph poles, livestock, people and nearly everything else 
before it hit Johnstown at 4:07 p.m., 57 minutes after the dam broke. 
Then a budding industrial city of about 10,000 deep in a bowl-like valley, 
Johnstown was already under several feet of water from the rains. 
Crashed Into City 
The mid-afternoon flood water, pushing a roll of debris before it, crashed into 
the city's busy steel mills, fragile wood-frame homes and finally into its 
sturdy Pennsylvania Railroad bridge. 
"Most of the people in Johnstown never saw the water coming; they only heard 
it," historian David G. McCullough wrote in his 1968 book, "The Johnstown 
Flood." 
"Those who actually saw the wall of water would talk and write about how it 
'snapped off trees like pipestems' or 'crushed houses like eggshells,' " 
McCullough wrote. "But what seemed 
to make the most lasting impression was the cloud of dark spray that hung over 
the front of the wave . . . it was talked of as 'the death mist' and would be 
remembered always." 
Scores of stranded people floated on a huge jumble of wreckage covering about 
30 acres that jammed up at the stone railroad bridge just below downtown. But 
the great pile caught fire and 80 helpless victims died in a second horror. 
Clara Barton, then 67 and eager to promote her new American Red Cross, rushed 
in from Washington and set up headquarters inside a boxcar. 
The new Red Cross helped organize field hospitals, kitchens and laundries. Five 
months later, Johnstown's citizens bid her farewell with a diamond locket and 
their grateful thanks. 
Mrs. Frum, then a 6-year-old schoolgirl, lived with her parents and two younger 
sisters in East Conemaugh, just upriver from Johnstown. Her father, John 
Shaffer, owned a planing mill next door. 
Mrs. Frum remembered her father as a nosy and nervous man, especially about 
increasing rumors that the South Fork Dam was in trouble. 
Shaffer had stepped outside in the rain to see if nearby wooden bridges were 
still standing when, Mrs. Frum recalls, everyone heard engineer John Hess' 
heroic warning whistle from the cab of Pennsylvania Railroad Engine 1124. 
Nearly Everyone Heard Alarm 
McCullough wrote: "Hess in his engine blazed down the valley, the water 
practically on top of him, in an incredibly heroic dash to sound the alarm. . . 
. Nearly everyone in East Conemaugh heard it and understood almost instantly 
what it meant." 
"That was our Paul Revere," Mrs. Frum recalls. "A man had taken his train up 
and he was on the way down, and saw the dam had broken. And he tied his whistle 
down. He jumped. He was saved. He stayed on it till he got into Conemaugh. 
"My father knew then that the dam had broken," she says. 
From the safety of a nearby hill, Elsie and her family saw "everything just 
roll away." 
"We could see things tumbling around in the water," she says. 
Shaffer sent his family into the country for a week. When Elsie returned, her 
father was building coffins for the dead brought to the nearby United Methodist 
Church. 
"I remember they brought the bodies there to wash, took them across to the 
church and laid them across the top of the seats," Mrs. Frum says. "They put a 
robe over them. He made the coffins to bury them in. That's what I remember. I 
saw all that. 
"It was horrible. I was scared to death of dead people. 
"I remember the cleanup. Every time they would dig a place for a home, they 
would find a body. And every time they would dig any place, they would find 
something, you know, a body or something." 
Bodies Were Found for Weeks 
Johnstown's dead were found miles past the stone bridge for weeks. Debris was 
recovered as far away as Pittsburgh, about 75 miles to the west. The last body 
was discovered 15 years later. 
Many bodies could not be identified, and 663 of the unknown were buried in a 
common plot in nearby Grandview Cemetery three years later. 
In terms of lives lost, the Johnstown Flood ranks as the second-worst natural 
disaster in U.S. history. A hurricane that hit Galveston, Tex., in 1890 left 
6,000 dead. The San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 ranks fifth, with 500 killed. 
The nation's press sensationalized the tragedy, sometimes filing false stories 
of heroism and looting. But the press also helped mobilize quick national and 
international help for the stricken area. 
Within days, trainloads of food, tents, clothing, lumber, construction 
supplies, and even coffins, arrived. Cash contributions from around the world 
totaled $3.7 million, according to McCullough. 
Mrs. Frum remembers the relief efforts, the immediate rescue and reconstruction 
activity. 
"All kinds of food came in and all kinds of clothing," she says. 
Lawsuits Filed 
Later, fingers of blame were pointed at the millionaires' South Fork Fishing 
and Hunting Club, which had allowed the dam at the former reservoir to 
deteriorate. Several lawsuits were filed and, without a lake, the club soon 
closed. 
But, McCullough reported, "not a nickel was ever collected through damage suits 
from the . . . club or from any of its members." 
"Every person was warned, oh, long before it 
broke," Mrs. Frum said. "Oh yes, they were warned. Every time it rained, they 
said the dam was going to break and it didn't. And, of course, when it 
happened, why, nobody thought it was going to happen and nobody ran -- but us." 
The Shaffers were lucky. The high water flooded their house and they returned 
to live in it. 
But Mrs. Frum lost everything, including the contents of her Johnstown home, on 
March 17, 1936, when a warm rain melted heavy winter snows too quickly and the 
city suffered its second major flood. The 1936 flood left 25 people dead and 
caused $41 million in damage. 
Moving to a nearby suburb atop a mountain, Mrs. Frum missed Johnstown's third 
great flood on July 22, 1977, when 11 inches of rain fell in the area in nine 
hours. The 1977 flood left 80 people dead and caused $350 million in damage. 
Mrs. Frum never left the Johnstown area, and she has survived two husbands. All 
of her 30 descendants are still alive. 
Hard Times 
"I have wondered, yes, a lot why I'm here," she says. "I guess it's just not 
time for me to go. I've gone through a lot. I don't want another flood, I know 
that." 
There have been other hard times for Johnstown. Stung by rapid declines in the 
steel industry, Johnstown at one point in 1983 bore the nation's highest 
unemployment rate, 26.6%, but at the same time it maintained the nation's 
lowest crime rate. 
The city, now about 35,000 people and slowly recovering economically, has 
planned more than 100 commemorative and special events this summer to mark the 
flood's 100th anniversary under the slogan, "A Triumph of the American Spirit." 
"The reason for the celebration is to show how the city has been resilient, not 
only from the floods, but from the various economic adversities," says Mayor 
Herbert Pfuhl Jr. 
Referring to survivors of the 1889 flood, Pfuhl says, "I think they'd be 
pleased with the changes and the progress that have happened."
