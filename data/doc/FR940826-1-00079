ACTION: 

Notice of 90-day petition finding.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 90-day finding for a petition to add the contiguous United
States population of the Canada lynx (

Lynx lynx canadensis

) to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species (List) and to add a southern Rocky Mountain population to the List
via an emergency listing. The Service finds the petition presents substantial information indicating the requested
action for the contiguous population may be warranted, but there is not substantial information to indicate that
an emergency listing of a southern Rocky Mountain population may be warranted. As a result of a previous court settlement,
a formal status review is underway.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

The finding announced in this document was made on August 19, 1994. Comments and materials need to be submitted to the
Service by October 1, 1994, to be considered in the 12-month finding.

Background



Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information to indicate that the petitioned action may be warranted. This
finding is to be based on all information available to the Service at the time the finding is made. To the maximum extent
practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the date the petition was received, and a notice regarding
the finding is to be published promptly in the 

Federal Register

. If the finding is that substantial information was presented, the Service also is required to promptly commence
a review of the status of the species involved if one has not already been initiated under the Service's internal candidate
assessment process.

This document meets the requirement that a notice be published for the 90-day finding made earlier for the petition
discussed below. Information contained in this document is a summary of the information in the 90-day finding, which
is the Service's decision document. A status review has been ongoing since the species was classified as a category
2 candidate species in the December 30, 1982, Vertebrate Notice of Review (47 FR 58454)

A petition dated April 23, 1994, was received by the Service from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation, Evan Frost, Mark
Skatrud, Craig Coonrad, and Michael J. Polly on April 27, 1994. The petition requested that the conterminous United
States population of the ``North American'' lynx (

Felis lynx canadensis

) be listed as a threatened or endangered species. Additionally, the petitioners requested that the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the ``North American'' lynx in Wyoming and Colorado be emergency listed.
