FT  09 JUL 94 / Eurotunnel action over duty-free on ferries
Eurotunnel, the company which operates the Channel tunnel, yesterday won
permission from a High Court judge to challenge duty-free sales on
cross-Channel ferries and on aircraft.
Mr Justice Tucker said it was 'a matter of very considerable public interest
and importance'. Eurotunnel hopes for the judicial review to take place
later this year, although a final judgment from the European Court could
take until 1996.
The company wants the courts to declare that the continuation of duty-free
sales on cross-border journeys within the European Union is unlawful under
the Single European Act.
The EU had intended to abolish duty-free sales in January 1993 - but
lobbying by the UK government led to their being extended until 1999. The
duty-free concession does not extend to trains travelling through the
tunnel, placing Eurotunnel at a competitive disadvantage compared with the
ferries, the company says.
Eurotunnel has built duty-free shops at its terminals in Folkestone and
Calais, but these require travellers to make a detour. The ferries are able
to subsidise their fares from their takings from duty-free sales, the
company says.
Mr David Vaughan, QC, for Eurotunnel, told the judge the duty-free trade
represented a loss of Pounds 600m a year in excise duty and value added tax.
