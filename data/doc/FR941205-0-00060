ACTION:

 Correcting amendment.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting the regulations that require nutrition labeling on most foods
that are regulated by FDA. In the 

Federal Register

 of August 18, 1993 (58 FR 44063), the agency published a document entitled ``Food Labeling: Mandatory Status of Nutrition
Labeling and Nutrient Content Revision, Format for Nutrition Label; Technical Amendment.'' The document was published
with an inadvertent error in the amendatory language. This document corrects that error.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of August 18, 1993, FDA published a document that amended the regulations that require nutrition labeling on most
foods regulated by FDA. The agency intended to revise the introductory text of 101.9(c)(1)(i) (21 CFR 101.9(c)(1)(i))
to specify that when either specific or general food factors are used in calculating caloric content, the factors
should be applied to actual amounts (i. e., before rounding) of food components. The agency inadvertently omitted
the words ``introductory text'' from amendatory statement 2 (58 FR 44076). Consequently, the actual methods for
calculating caloric content were removed from the Code of Federal Regulations. Accordingly, this document corrects
101.9(c)(1)(i) to restore the methods.


List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 101


Food labeling, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.



Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs, 21 CFR part 101 is corrected by making the following correcting amendments:


PART 101_FOOD LABELING


1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 101 continues to read as follows:





Authority:

 Secs. 4, 5, 6, of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 1453, 1454, 1455); secs. 201, 301, 402, 403, 409, 701
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 331, 342, 343, 348, 371).



2. Section 101.9 is amended by revising paragraph (c)(1)(i) to read as follows: 


101.9 

Nutrition labeling of food.


 * * * * *


(c) * * *
(1) * * *
(i) Caloric content may be calculated by the following methods. Where either specific or general food factors are
used, the factors shall be applied to the actual amount (i.e., before rounding) of food components (e.g., fat, carbohydrate,
protein, or ingredients with specific food factors) present per serving. 
(A) Using specific Atwater factors (i. e., the Atwater method) given in Table 13, ``Energy Value of Foods_Basis and
Derivation,'' by A. L. Merrill and B. K. Watt, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Handbook No. 74 (slightly
revised, 1973), which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 and is available
from the Office of Food Labeling (HFS150), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration,
200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, or may be inspected at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol St.
NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.;
(B) Using the general factors of 4, 4, and 9 calories per gram for protein, total carbohydrate, and total fat, respectively,
as described in USDA Handbook No. 74 (slightly revised 1973) pp. 911, which is incorporated by reference in
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 (the availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph
(c)(1)(i)(A) of this section);
(C) Using the general factors of 4, 4, and 9 calories per gram for protein, total carbohydrate less the amount of insoluble
dietary fiber, and total fat, respectively, as described in USDA Handbook No. 74 (slightly revised 1973) pp. 911,
which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 (the availability of this incorporation
by reference is given in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section;
(D) Using data for specific food factors for particular foods or ingredients approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and provided in parts 172 or 184 of this chapter, or by other means, as appropriate; or

(E) Using bomb calorimetry data subtracting 1.25 calories per gram protein to correct for incomplete digestibility,
as described in USDA Handbook No. 74 (slightly revised 1973) p. 10, which is incorporated by reference in accordance
with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51 (the availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)
of this section).
