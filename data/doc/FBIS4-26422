  [Text] Shanghai, June 18 (XINHUA) -- Five foreign 
companies have won bids for supplying the latest technology to 
the Shanghai Baoshan Steel Plant for manufacturing a 1,420-mm 
cold rolling production line. 
  Three companies are from Germany, one from Japan and one 
from 
the United States. They include the German firms of Siemens and 
Schloemann-Siemag Aktiengesellschaft and the Nippon Steel 
Corporation of Japan. 
  An official of the modern plant said that, instead of 
importing a whole set of the technology and equipment, the plant 
will mainly import the latest technology and cooperate with 
these companies in design and manufacturing of the equipment. 
  According to the official, the plant will build three sets 
of 
cold rollers to produce cold-rolled steel plates, tin-plated 
plates, electrical steel and silicon steel plates. 
  The agreement signed here today includes manufacturing of a 
cold roller mill with an annual capacity of 70,000 tons of 1,420 
mm tin-planted sheets ranging 0.18-0.55 mm in thickness.
