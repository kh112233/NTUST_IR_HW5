  [Text] Rio de Janeiro -- A person very close to numbers 
game kingpin Castor de Andrade has sent a lot of money to Cali, 
Colombia -- the seat of one of the largest cocaine trafficking 
cartels. Documents proving this remittance were seized at Casto 
de Andrade's fortress. Rio de Janeiro Attorney Antonio Carlos 
Biscaia said: "The numbers game is no longer just the game that 
so many people enjoy; it is a mask behind which several forms of 
organized crime hide." 
  Attorneys examining the numbers game kingpins' accounts have 
also found that in January 1993, Castor de Andrade deposited 
$500,000 in the Swiss Banks Association. Biscaia said: "The 
numbers game has been used to permeate crime throughout society, 
by bribing policemen and judges, by supporting samba groups and 
soccer teams, and even by financing politicians' electoral 
campaigns." These accounting books list sums paid to several 
candidates and contributions to political campaigns. Biscaia 
said: "It is all written down in the books, even the $100,000 
given to a major candidate."
