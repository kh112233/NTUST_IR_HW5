FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Cascades back in black at
CDollars 2.5m
Cascades, the Canadian-based international paper and packaging group, posted
second-quarter net profit of CDollars 2.5m (USDollars 1.8m), or 1 cent a
share, against a loss of CDollars 1.9m, or 7 cents, a year earlier.
Sales were CDollars 394m, against CDollars 416m. The figures reflect the
sale of part of Cascades Paperboard International and the shutdown of the
Duffel boardmill in Belgium.
Most of the Cascades group's packaging interests in North America and Europe
are part of majority-held Cascades Paperboard International.
First-half profit for Cascades amounted to CDollars 7.7m, or 7 cents a
share, against a net loss of CDollars 1.1m, or 8 cents. Sales were CDollars
759m, down from CDollars 835m, a fall of 9 per cent.
Mr Laurent Lemaire, president, said the company would contest a fine of
CDollars 28m imposed on its Paris-based holding company, Cascades SA,
following a European competition commissioners' finding against the European
paperboard industry. The commission alleges price-fixing.
