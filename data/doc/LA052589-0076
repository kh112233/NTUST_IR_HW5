METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JACKSON FILES CLAIM IN VIDEOTAPED ARREST 
Activist Don Jackson filed a claim this week against the city of Long Beach, 
asking for damages arising from a nationally publicized incident in which an 
officer allegedly pushed Jackson through a plate-glass window. 
The claim, received Wednesday by the city clerk, asks for unspecified damages 
after Jackson and a colleague, Jeffrey C. Hill, were "illegally detained, 
arrested, cited and criminally charged on fictional accounts in police reports 
and criminally prosecuted in bad faith." 
The claim stems from the Jan. 14 incident in which Jackson, a former Hawthorne 
police sergeant, and Hill, an off-duty federal corrections officer, were 
stopped by two officers as they drove along Pacific Coast Highway. They had 
come to Long Beach with an NBC television crew to conduct a "sting" amid 
reports that the city's police were racist and brutal. 
The crew videotaped Officer Mark Dickey as he appeared to smash Jackson's head 
through a storefront window and throw him onto the hood of patrol car. Dickey 
and fellow officer Mark Ramsey now face misdemeanor charges of filing a false 
report. Dickey alone is charged with assault. 
Dickey and Ramsey are among those named in the claim, which alleges that 
Jackson and Hill were deprived of their civil rights and subjected to false 
arrest, racism and brutality.
