  [Text] London, April 27 KYODO -- Japan led the 
industrialized world in piracy of business software in 1993, 
with 80 percent of programs in use believed to be illegal 
copies, a London-based computer software association said 
Wednesday [28 April]. Piracy in Japan cost the software 
publishing and distribution industries an estimated 1.9 billion 
dollars, according to the Business Software Alliance. 
  A survey of 54 nations conducted by the association of 15 
European and American software houses showed that the industry 
lost 12.8 billion dollars worldwide. 
  The piracy rate was lowest in the United States at 35 
percent, while the rate for Thailand, Indonesia and Russia stood 
at 98 to 99 percent, the association said. 
  Tougher government enforcement in Italy helped slash the 
rate 
of illegal software from 86 percent in 1992 to 50 percent in 
1993, the association said. It said the Italian Government 
stepped up police raids of companies following enactment of a 
new copyright law. 
  The business software alliance is devoted to eradicating 
software theft worldwide.
