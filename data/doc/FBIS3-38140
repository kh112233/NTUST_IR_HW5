  [Text] "Italy is once again confronted with the tragic 
death of some of its citizens in the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. This time they were carrying out their duty of 
reporting, which is something very important in the framework of 
the tragic crisis in Bosnia," Foreign Minister Beniamino 
Andreatta has written to his Croatian counterpart Mate Granic. 
  Andreatta said that he is certain "that the Croatian 
Government too will condemn this execrable incident" and that 
all the parties involved will contribute without reservation to 
ascertaining responsibility.
