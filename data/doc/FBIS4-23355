  [Text] Johannesburg June 2 SAPA -- Three hundred million US 
dollars -- count 'em. That's what police searching for illegal 
firearms in a Turffontein, Johannesburg house came across early 
on Thursday [2 June] evening. 
  SA Police Services [SAPS] spokesman Capt Wikus Weber said 
members of the Vaal Triangle firearm unit, following up on 
leads, went to the Turffontein property. The officers found 
firearms -- "but they turned out to be legal". 
  What wasn't so legal, though, was a pile of counterfeit us 
dollars big enough to make even your bank manager drool -- three 
million hundred dollar notes. 
  Police also took possession of printing apparatus and placed 
under arrest a 60-year-old man who would probably appear in 
court on Friday, the SAPS spokesman said.
