  [Text] Sofia, Feb. 1, IRNA -- Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati Monday voiced readiness of the Islamic countries to 
dispatch peace-keeping forces to Bosnia-Herzegovina under the 
flag of the United Nations. 
  Speaking to local reporters at the end of the first round of 
talks with his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Dascalov, 
Velayati said the forces can play an outstanding role in the 
establishment of peace and tranquillity in the Balkans and 
former Yugoslavia. Velayati who arrived here Monday on an 
official 2-day visit, made the remark in response to a question 
of Bulgarian reporters on the incompetence of the United Nations 
with regard to the Bosnian crisis. 
  He stressed that Iran would not spare any effort for the 
establishment of a just and honorable peace in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The Bulgarian Government which used to export a considerable 
amount of goods through former Yugoslavia prior to the arms 
embargo, has asked the U.N. for compensation. 
  A source close to the both sides told IRNA here that the 
Bulgarian foreign minister has expressed deep concern over the 
spread of the war in the Balkans and stressed his country's 
readiness to help establishment of peace in the region through 
international cooperation.
