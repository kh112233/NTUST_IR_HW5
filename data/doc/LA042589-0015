LOS ANGELES ELECTION 
The disgracefully low turnout (25% or less) for the Los Angeles elections may 
be more a result of the apathy and stupidity of the bureaucracy already in 
place than any alleged apathy on the part of the people (Part I, April 12). 
Does anyone recall a campaign? What were the issues? What candidate made a 
public statement? When? Where? 
After receiving my voter registration card (dated March 2, effective for 
elections on or after April 4), I received three official sample ballots, sent 
for an absentee ballot, and received a letter April 6 asking me to verify my 
change of address, which I returned promptly. I still have not received my 
absentee ballot, and, like many, was unable to go to my polling place. 
Given the previously low election turnout, why didn't Los Angeles City Clerk 
Elias Martinez insist on mandatory absentee ballots? If the current do-nothing 
city government would encourage, or at least allow us to vote, we would vote 
them out of office.
