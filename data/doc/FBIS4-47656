  [Text] Nairobi, May 2 (AFP) -- Twelve people have been 
killed and 113 wounded in a Kigali church by mortar fire, 
according to a statement issued by the UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda and made available here Monday [2 May]. 
  Two shells hit the Sainte-Famille Church in downtown Kigali 
Sunday where more than 2,000 people fleeing the fighting between 
government forces and Rwanda Patriotic Front rebels had found 
shelter. The UN mission said it could not determine the origin 
of the fire. 
  UN special envoy Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh said the latest 
attack again targeted civilians who were "innocent victims of a 
war they do not want." He urged the warring parties not to 
attack civilians. 
  Within the last two weeks shells have also hit the Roi 
Faycal 
hospital and the Amahoro de Kigali stadium, killing more than 60 
people. 
  More than 12,000 people mostly Tutsis, fleeing massacres 
perpetrated by the armed forces and Hutu militias, have found 
shelter in these two facilities under UN protection.
