THE WORLD 
At least 51 people, including 35 schoolgirls, were killed when a train slammed 
into a crowded bus in southern Sri Lanka. About 72 bus passengers were injured 
in the accident at an unprotected level crossing at Ahungalle, 60 miles south 
of Colombo, the capital. No one on the train was hurt. The state-owned bus was 
carrying students from four local schools who were returning home from a visit 
to a clinic. The train, traveling about 50 m.p.h., crushed the bus and broke it 
in two, dragging part of it 250 yards.
