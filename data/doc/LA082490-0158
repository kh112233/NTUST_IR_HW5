JUDGE CLEARS JUDAS PRIEST OF LIABILITY IN 2 SUICIDES 
Hidden words do exist on an album by the British rock band Judas Priest, but 
they were not placed there intentionally and the group is not responsible for a 
suicide pact formed by two young fans, a judge ruled today. 
Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead said the alleged words "do it" were 
the result of a chance combination of sounds. 
The families of the two victims sued the band and CBS Records, claiming 
messages hidden in the crashing music of the 1978 "Stained Glass" album touted 
satanism and promoted suicide. 
Raymond Belknap, 18, died from a single blast from a shotgun held in his mouth 
Dec. 23, 1985. James Vance, then 20, blew away the lower portion of his face 
but survived three more years before his death on Thanksgiving, 1988. 
The lawyers contended that subliminal messages, including the words "do it" 
allegedly hidden in the song "Better by You, Better Than Me," spurred the 
shootings. They also charged that the album contained backward messages touting 
death, satanism and suicide. 
The defense maintained the phrases were "phonetic flukes," given credibility 
only by the power of suggestion. 
In clearing the band of liability, Whitehead said that CBS Records refused to 
properly comply with discovery orders involving the original master tape of the 
album. He said the defaults were not caused by the courtroom lawyers but by 
in-house counsel of CBS. He ordered the company to pay $40,000 to the 
plaintiffs' attorneys to reimburse them for the cost of bringing the lawsuit.
