FT  29 NOV 94 / Technology: Closing in on a serial killer - Cancer kills
five people every minute of the day. In the first of a six-part series,
Clive Cookson reports on the war against cancer and the encouraging trends
behind the statistics
Cancer continues to sink its claws deeper into mankind. After two decades of
'war on cancer', fuelled by billions of research dollars, the death toll
rises inexorably.
The disease - named after the Latin word for crab because of the crab-like
pattern made by blood vessels on a growing tumour - will kill an estimated
2.5m people in the industrialised world this year. That amounts to almost a
quarter of all deaths.
The gloomy mortality statistics contrast with excitement among cancer
researchers, who have made more progress towards understanding the
fundamental processes responsible for the disease over the past 15 years
than in all previous history. The important question for present and future
cancer patients is how quickly the new knowledge can be converted into
better diagnosis and treatment.
At present there is a gap between doctors' continuing inability to provide
much more than palliative care for millions of cancer patients and the
cascade of optimistic stories in the popular media about 'breakthroughs' in
research, such as discovering cancer genes and inventing experimental drugs.
There is an inevitable delay - typically a decade or so - while an advance
in medical science is developed for commercial application. So no one should
expect the latest discoveries to have made any clinical impact yet. But many
people will remember 'breakthroughs' from the 1970s and early 1980s, such as
interferon and 'magic bullet' antibodies, which would have transformed
cancer treatment by now - if they had lived up to first expectations.
Very few patients are treated with novel approaches derived from
biotechnology. The vast majority still undergo the well-established
procedures of chemotherapy (poisoning cancer cells with a drug cocktail) and
radiotherapy (destroying them with radiation). Surgery is also used to cut
out solid tumours.
'We hear the word 'breakthrough' thrown around too much,' says Nicholas
Wright, clinical director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London,
'and we certainly get the impression that the public are a bit jaundiced by
scientists talking about breakthroughs.'
Why are more people contracting and dying from cancer? The first reason is
an epidemic of cancers caused by smoking, particularly lung cancer. 'At
least 30 per cent of all cancer deaths are tobacco-related,' says Archie
Turnbull, executive secretary of the Geneva-based UICC, an umbrella body for
the world's cancer charities.
A second, more fundamental, reason is that cancer is mainly a disease of old
age. As medicine becomes more successful at preventing early deaths from
other illnesses such as heart attacks and strokes, more people are living
beyond the age of 70, above which the risk of cancer rises rapidly.
Despite the overall rise in cancer mortality, there have been substantial
improvements in some areas. The most encouraging feature of the statistics
since the 1970s is the progress in curing cancers in children and young
adults - particularly leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease and testicular cancer -
through new drug combinations. The number of children under the age of 15
dying from cancer has fallen by half.
There are two principal reasons why young people are responding more readily
to treatment. One is that youthful cancer cells in the blood or lymph
systems are physically easier to reach and destroy with drugs and/or
radiation than the solid tumours of the middle-aged and elderly. Another
reason is that the difference between proliferating cancer cells and normal
cells is greater in childhood cancers than in slower-growing adult tumours.
Therefore chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which work by damaging DNA during
cell division, can destroy more cancer cells without causing unacceptable
side-effects.
Prospects for curing the big killers - tumours of the lungs, bowels,
stomach, breast, prostate and pancreas - depend above all on developing
treatments that discriminate more effectively between cancer and normal
cells than the drugs used in chemotherapy today.
The discovery of genetic changes leading to cancer should make this
possible, says Gordon McVie, scientific director of the Cancer Research
Campaign. 'These provide for the first time an absolute chemical difference
between the cells. Until now we have had to rely on qualitative differences
 -the cancer cells making rather more of some proteins and less of others.'
Scientists have identified more than 100 genes that can trigger the cellular
processes leading to cancer, if they mutate. (Causes of mutation include
carcinogenic chemicals, radiation, family inheritance, and random changes
during cell division.)
One dangerous type of genetic change stimulates cell growth. Another shuts
down the protective 'tumour suppressor' genes which normally prevent
excessive proliferation. The former has been compared with a car that has
its accelerator jammed on, the latter with a failure in the brakes.
New approaches to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer are
being built on such differences between the genes of diseased and normal
cells - and the corresponding differences in the proteins they produce. One
possibility is to block the damaging effects of abnormal 'growth factors'
which sustain the proliferation of tumour cells, without harming healthy
cell growth.
But cancer genes are not the only reason why researchers are excited.
Another is their new understanding of the way the body's immune system
recognises and attacks cancer cells. This has led to experimental 'cancer
vaccines' to boost the immune response.
These novel 'biotech' approaches to cancer diagnosis and treatment will be
examined over the next six months on the Financial Times technology page. So
will advances in more conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
The aim is to convey the real optimism that now prevails in the laboratories
 -a hope and expectation that cancer will eventually be restricted to a
disease of the very old - without raising excessive expectations about the
speed and ease with which this will happen.
After 50 years in cancer research, Sir Richard Doll of the ICRF Cancer
Studies Unit in Oxford sums up the mood: 'We are winning the war against
cancer, albeit slowly.'
