VIOLENCE IS THE BEST-KEPT POLICE SECRET 
Widespread media coverage of the recent encounter between Don Jackson of the 
Police Misconduct Lawyers Referral Service and Long Beach police officer Mark 
Dickey has resulted in public awareness of a serious problem involving 
law-enforcement practices. 
Critics of the sting and its coverage by NBC complain that it is unfair to 
"ambush" an officer with a TV camera. Our organization maintains that the sting 
was a legitimate means of documenting a problem that many people do not want to 
believe exists. 
Other critics say that Jackson "pushed the officer's buttons" by getting out of 
the car and by being "sassy." Although officers should be alert for danger at 
all times, including during traffic stops, they should also be aware that there 
are countless totally innocent reasons why a passenger might get out of a car 
that has been stopped. It is simply not true that people are taught to stay in 
the car, and every officer knows that there is no law requiring them to do so. 
A well-trained officer should be able to retain his composure when confronted 
with nothing more than a person getting out of a car during a traffic stop and 
asking questions. 
Officers also know that the law specifically permits individuals to question, 
or even curse, representatives of the government. This is the United States, 
not South Africa, and the First Amendment to the Constitution expressly 
provides for freedom of speech -- whether the speech is directed at a 
President, a governor, a postal employee or a police officer. 
The fact is that if Officer Dickey had intended to behave professionally, he 
would have resolved the matter without verbal abuse or physical violence. His 
conduct cannot be justified by the "button-pushing" argument; if his buttons 
are that sensitive, he is unfit for patrol work. 
Notwithstanding the fact that most police officers do a difficult job well, Don 
Jackson -- an officer himself -- was correct when he said that the incident was 
"consistent with a pattern of abuse and excessive force." The videotape is but 
one piece of evidence that there is indeed a pattern of violence in Southern 
California law enforcement, and that in the overwhelming majority of cases the 
victims are black or Latino. Evidence of the pattern is also found in 
videotapes of Torrance officers choking and beating a young white man, of San 
Bernardino officers beating Latino men, and in the violence visited on black 
undercover officers by other LAPD officers, and on Ken Maddox, a former aide to 
the mayor. 
Several police departments have requested copies of the Torrance videotape in 
order to train their officers in how not to behave. But when police, confronted 
by public criticism, attempt to justify their use of violence, they only 
perpetuate it and undermine the professional standards that most 
law-enforcement officers observe. 
Racism and abuse of power were the salient features of Los Angeles Police Chief 
Daryl F. Gates' gang sweeps, in which 90% of the several thousand young black 
and Latino men arrested had committed no crime. Then there is the Dalton Street 
incident of last August, probably the most publicized of the many instances of 
gratuitous violence by police in conducting residential searches. (Reportedly, 
18 LAPD officers face disciplinary proceedings for the destruction of the 
Dalton Street residences and the personal property of four black families.) 
The foregoing cases are the most notorious, but the pattern of violence also is 
reflected in the large volume of calls to the Police Misconduct Lawyers 
Referral Service. Slightly more than 200 were received in December, requesting 
legal assistance in matters ranging from verbal abuse by police to false arrest 
to physical violence and death. While not all of the calls turn out to involve 
police conduct that was improper, a frightening number do -- so many that the 
service is unable to find enough lawyers to share the caseload. 
Among the reasons for the violence is the failure of government institutions to 
investigate the problem, to compile and disclose the evidence and to state 
unambiguously that unnecessary violence is unprofessional and intolerable. 
Sharing in the responsibility are sheriffs and police chiefs who do not enforce 
regulations, prosecutors who are reluctant to prosecute police, local 
governments that are too timorous to exercise oversight, the state Legislature, 
which passed laws shielding complaints against police from public scrutiny, and 
courts that show extraordinary leniency in sentencing officers convicted of 
using excessive force and in granting them relief from discipline imposed by 
responsible tribunals. 
If, as some suggest, Don Jackson was provocative, it was only in provoking a 
public debate on an issue that has been ignored in most communities. Having now 
been exposed to what is virtually a daily event in minority neighborhoods in 
Southern California, the public should turn to local governments to correct the 
problem -- and should be as sassy as necessary.
