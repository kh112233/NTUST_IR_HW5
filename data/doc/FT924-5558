FT  26 NOV 92 / Ten hurt as trains collide in London
INVESTIGATORS are examining the possibility that driver error or signal
failure caused the train crash that injured 10 rush-hour commuters in London
yesterday.
The crash happened at 7.30am when a near-empty Charing Cross to Tunbridge
Wells train hit the side of a crowded Ramsgate to Charing Cross train at
Borough Market junction, near London Bridge.
Both trains were travelling slowly and injuries were slight, but the
collision caused severe disruption to thousands of commuters travelling into
Charing Cross, Cannon Street, Waterloo East, Blackfriars and London Bridge
stations.
The accident also caused the cancellation of a ceremony at Cannon Street at
which Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Sir Bob Reid, British
Rail's chairman, had been due to inaugurate a new generation of commuter
trains for Network SouthEast's poorly performing Kent Link services.
