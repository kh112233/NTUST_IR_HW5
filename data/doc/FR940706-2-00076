ACTION:

 Notice. 




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Infectious Diseases, announces the opportunity
for potential collaborators to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) for the further
development, refinement, and validation of three interrelated technologies: (1) The Exchangeable Template Reaction
(ETR), a method to assemble synthetic genes, (2) the construction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) specific ``mosaic''
proteins composed of immunodominant antigenic epitopes, and (3) differential HCV diagnostic tests. It is anticipated
that these and any new technologies or inventions which may arise from this CRADA will be licensed to the collaborator
with whom the CRADA is made. 



Because CRADAs are designed to facilitate the development of scientific and technological knowledge into useful,
marketable products, a great deal of freedom is given to Federal agencies in implementing collaborative research.
The CDC may accept staff, facilities, equipment, supplies, and money from the other participants in a CRADA; CDC may
provide staff, facilities, equipment, and supplies to the project. There is a single restriction in this exchange:
CDC MAY NOT PROVIDE FUNDS to the other participants in a CRADA. This opportunity is available until 30 days after publication
of this notice. Respondents may be provided a longer period of time to furnish additional information if CDC finds
this necessary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The goal of this CRADA is to bring to market HCV-specific technologies that will improve public health. CDC will provide
intellectual insight and experimental design protocols to: (1) Improve the efficiency of ETR, (2) construct ``mosaic''
proteins for HCV that have immunodiagnostic and potential vaccine relevance, and (3) evaluate synthetic peptides
containing antigenic epitopes as reagents to discriminate recent from late infections or that may predict outcome
of HCV infection. CDC will design and conduct feasibility experiments for each of the project areas and will contribute
in the preparation of serologic panels to validate various test formats. The CRADA partner will prepare all synthetic
peptides and oligonucleotides as necessary for each project area, prepare monospecific and monoclonal antibodies
whenever appropriate, and purify antigens from recombinant lysates as needed. The collaborator will utilize its
expertise in market research to evaluate the commercialization of the technologies. 




Respondents should provide evidence of expertise in the development and evaluation of diagnostic assays, evidence
of experience in commercialization of diagnostics products, and supporting data (e.g., publications, proficiency
testing, certifications, resumes, etc.) of qualifications for the principle investigator who would be involved
in the CRADA. The 
respondent will develop the final research plan in collaboration with CDC. 

Applicant submissions will be judged according to the following criteria: 

1. Expertise in diagnostic virolgoy; 
2. Evidence of scientific credibility; 
3. Evidence of commitment and ability to develop innovative designs for diagnostic assays and/or vaccines; 
4. Evidence of preparing synthetic peptides and oligonucleotides; 
5. Evidence of a strong engineering department to design automated equipment; and, 
6. Evidence of an existing infrastructure to commercialize on successful technologies. 

This CRADA is proposed and implemented under the 1986 Federal Technology Transfer Act, Public Law 99502 (15
U.S.C. 3710). 

The responses must be made to: Lisa Blake-Despigna, Technology Transfer Coordinator, National Center for Infectious
Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Mailstop C19, Atlanta,
GA 30333.
