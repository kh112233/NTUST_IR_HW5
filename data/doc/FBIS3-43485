  [Text] The president, Sir Ketumile Masire, says Botswana 
offers foreign investors advantages such as good transport and 
communication links with neighboring countries. Other 
advantages include her liberal foreign exchange regime, a stable 
source of a political system, and respect for the rule of law. 
  He was speaking at a dinner he hosted last night for 
Governor 
Douglas Wilder of the American State of Virginia at State House. 
Governor Wilder is in Botswana to inaugurate Virginia's Trade 
and Investment Office for southern Africa. 
  President Masire said his government intends to follow and 
extend the policies that have made Botswana an attractive place 
to establish the Virginia Trade and Investment Office. He noted 
that Botswana recently completed formal procedures to join the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, as part of her 
program to make the economy more open and competitive. 
  The president said the diversification of Botswana's economy 
should open new opportunities for the supply of goods and 
services to his country and new sources of supply for Virginia 
and the United States. Sir Ketumile noted that the next few 
years will be momentous for the southern Africa region as steps 
are being taken to achieve peace. The president added that 
there's hope for peace and stability in Mozambique. Other 
countries in the region are, with different degrees of success, 
taking steps to put their economies on order. 
  Governor Wilder and his party flew to Kasane today where 
[name indistinct] is hosting a business lunch for them where 
they will meet key members of the business community. Mr. 
Wilder returns to Gaborone tomorrow to appoint the first 
representative of the Virginia trade office.
