FT  09 NOV 93 / Voter turnout low in Jordan
The people of Jordan voted yesterday in the kingdom's first multi-party
elections since 1956, James Whittington writes from Amman. A total of 534
candidates, including three women and more than 15 political parties, stood
for the 80-member lower house of parliament which along with the Senate,
whose members are appointed by the king, forms the national legislature.
