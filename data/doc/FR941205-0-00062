<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of 2-methyl-4,6-bis[(octylthio)methyl]phenol
as a stabilizer in can-end and side seam cements and in various polymers intended for use in contact with food. This
action is in response to a petition filed by Ciba-Geigy Corp.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of December 2, 1991 (56 FR 61253), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 1B4283) had been filed by Ciba-Geigy
Corp., Seven Skyline Dr., Hawthorne, NY 105322188. The petition proposed that 178.2010 

Antioxidants and/or stabilizers for polymers

 (21 CFR 178.2010) be amended to provide for the safe use of 2-methyl-4,6-bis[(octylthio)methyl]phenol as a stabilizer
in can-end and side seam cements and in various polymers intended for use in contact with food. 



 FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material. The agency concludes that the proposed food additive
use is safe, and that this use should be listed in 178.2010, as set forth below. In addition, FDA is correcting
the entry for this additive in 178.2010(b), in the table under the heading ``Substances'' to capitalize the
letter ``m'' in ``methyl.'' Thus, it will read ``2-Methyl-4,6-bis[(octylthio)methyl]phenol.''

A review of the petition indicates that the additive may contain trace amounts of formaldehyde as an impurity. The
potential carcinogenicity of formaldehyde was reviewed by the Cancer Assessment Committee (the committee) that
has been formed by FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. The committee noted that for many years formaldehyde
has been known to be a carcinogen by the inhalation route, but it concluded that these inhalation studies are not appropriate
for assessing the potential carcinogenicity of formaldehyde in food. The committee reached its conclusion because
the route of administration was not relevant to food safety, and the fact that tumors were observed only locally at
the portal of entry (nasal turbinates). The agency has received literature reports of two drinking water studies
on formaldehyde: (1) A preliminary report of a carcinogenicity study purported to be positive by Soffritti et al.
(1989), conducted in Bologna, Italy (Ref. 1) and (2) a negative study by Til, et al. (1989), conducted in The Netherlands
(Ref. 2). The committee reviewed both studies and concluded in a ``Memorandum of Conference,'' dated April 24, 1991,
and March 4, 1993, ``* * * that data concerning the Soffritti study reported were unreliable and could not be used in
the assessment of the oral carcinogenicity of formaldehyde'' (Ref. 3). This conclusion is based on a lack of critical
details in the study, questionable histopathologic conclusions, and the use of unusual nomenclature to describe
the tumors. Thus, the committee concluded that there is no basis to find that formaldehyde is a carcinogen when ingested.

In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.

The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.

Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before January 4, 1995, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
