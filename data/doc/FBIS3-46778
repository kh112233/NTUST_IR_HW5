Nonproliferation in Northeast Asia" by Dr. Jan Yong-sup, aide to 
the Defense Ministry] 
  [Text] North Koreans have maintained that their nuclear 
program is solely for peaceful purposes and went a step further 
alleging that the peaceful nature of their nuclear program has 
been proved since the first IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] for ad-hoc inspection. 
  According to the North Korean Government's explanation to 
the 
IAEA, they developed spent-fuel reprocessing plant for the later 
use of fast breeder reactors or mixed oxide fuels, adding, 
however, North Korea's technological capability does not match 
with such advanced technology. 
  This can be interpreted as a groundless excuse. However, the 
experimental 5MWe reactor at Yongbyon is a graphite-moderate, 
natural-uranium-fueled and gas-cooled reactor which is more 
appropriate for generating spent fuel as quickly as possible to 
produce weapons-grade plutonium rather than for generating 
electricity. 
  North Koreans are reluctant to sign the Chemical Weapons 
Convention (CWC) because its clause pertaining to inspections 
may spill over to the nuclear issue. If they accept the CWC, 
there will be no grounds to shrink from any kind of inspections. 
  Decisions to go nuclear seem to have been made in the early 
1960s. The push for the program became more compelling in the 
late 1980s for the following reasons: North Korea's concern 
about rising costs when trying to match more advanced South 
Korean conventional weapons capabilities, its concern about 
cutbacks in Soviet arms supplies and the Kremlin's distancing 
from the North to become closer to the South, China's failure to 
provide any real substitutes and lastly the concern reinforced 
by the technologically superior U.S.-led multi-national forces 
defeating the Soviet-armed Iraqis in the Gulf war. 
  More serious is North Korea's intention to wage another war 
with nuclear weapons in an era of austerity for the North Korean 
regime which is doomed to collapse if the worst case scenario 
unfolds: to initiate a surprise attack on the South and occupy 
some territory and negotiate a surprise attack on the South and 
occupy some territory and negotiate for the termination of war, 
or to deny U.S. reinforcement by threatening to use nuclear 
weapons. 
  As we know from North Korea's behavior toward the IAEA 
inspections, its nuclear policy is no more than withholding 
information, hindering, covering up and fabricating facts. 
  The North Koreans have alleged they have extracted a tiny 
amount (gram units) of plutonium in 1990. However, they 
withheld the information as to what they have done with the 
plutonium and what they have done with the reprocessing 
capabilities since then. An analysis of the samples taken from 
the small amount of plutonium indicates large discrepancies with 
the timing and the number of batches processed. 
<H5>  Actual amount </H5>
  The discrepancies largely have to do with the actual amount 
of plutonium they have extracted. Estimates range between 8 kg 
and 24 kg. 
  North Korea's official response to the outside world about 
its nuclear weapons program is always the same: "We have no 
intentions, nor capabilities to manufacture nuclear weapons." 
  If North Korea pushes the nuclear program, the consequences 
will be significant, not being limited to the Korean Peninsula. 
The fear that the North may use nuclear weapons in war provides 
Seoul with a strong incentive to get nuclear weapons. Japan 
will hardly tolerate such a situation, either. Having advanced 
nuclear technology and a serious concern about North Korea's 
deep-strike delivery capabilities, there may be no reason for 
Japan to sit idle. 
  Though the IAEA has conducted six ad-hoc inspections on 
North 
Korean nuclear sites, it could not find out the totality of the 
North Korean nuclear program. As is known, the IAEA inspection 
regime has inherent limitations. 
  The IAEA inspections are limited to the sites declared by a 
member state. When the state itself refrains from declaring and 
identifying its secret activities, there is no effective way to 
inspect the undeclared sites as of now. 
  Though the IAEA Board of Governors already has reaffirmed 
the 
IAEA's right to request inspection to identify undeclared 
nuclear material in case there are reasons to believe such 
material exists and explanations have not clarified the matter, 
North Korea is becoming the first test case for special 
inspections. 
  Before such special inspections become institutionalized, 
there exists no effective way to prevent clandestine efforts 
under there present IAEA inspection regime to develop nuclear 
weapons despite the IAEA safeguard inspections. 
  Keeping these limitations in mind and attempting to resolve 
major discrepancies between North Korea's declaration and the 
IAEA's findings, the IAEA Board of Governors Meeting issued a 
resolution that called on the North to fully cooperate with the 
IAEA to enable the IAEA to conduct special inspections on the 
two suspect sites within one month after the adoption of the 
resolution. 
  If North Korea does not respond positively, this case may be 
brought to the U.N. Security Council after the deliberation 
process by the IAEA Board of Governors. 
  If the IAEA and South Korea do not succeed in preventing the 
North Korean nuclear program within a short period of time, then 
vocal sentiments inside South Korean may rise to reconsider the 
policy of not developing nuclear reprocessing and uranium 
enrichment capabilities. Even more serious is the possibility of 
going nuclear.
