NATION IN BRIEF; 
WASHINGTON, D.C.; 
FIRST LADY BACKS SALVATION ARMY 
First Lady Barbara Bush urged shopping malls not to bar holiday Salvation Army 
solicitors, as she dropped $10 into the kettle at a Washington, D.C., mall 
where she was Christmas shopping. Mrs. Bush cited the group's work to help the 
needy and victims of natural disasters and said: "It just wouldn't be Christmas 
without that bell ringing." A comparatively high number of Washington malls are 
excluding the annual solicitation on the grounds that they do not allow any 
other groups to solicit. A Salvation Army officer said that the bans will cost 
the group about $100,000 this year.
