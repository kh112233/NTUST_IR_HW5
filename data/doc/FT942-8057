FT  23 MAY 94 / Rwanda rebels take government barracks
Rwandan rebels yesterday captured the government army barracks in the
capital, Kigali, removing the biggest obstacle in their drive to seize power
in the city, reports Reuter from Kigali.
Witnesses said the Kanombe barracks, like the nearby airport taken earlier
by the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels, fell without serious resistance.
Asked what was now the RPF's target, a senior officer said: 'The city and
then the country.'
Hundreds of civilians were streaming out from districts around the barracks
to the relative safety of the airport, now firmly in rebel hands.
The RPF military leader, Maj-Gen Paul Kagame, is credited with rebuilding
its army single-handed when the death of its former leader in October 1990
threatened to tear the movement apart.
Government and rebel forces have agreed to a truce while UN envoys are in
the country, from 8am local time today until 6pm tomorrow, UN military
commander General Romeo Dallaire told Reuters.
Uganda declared districts bordering Lake Victoria disaster areas yesterday
because of the danger posed by corpses that have floated downriver from
Rwanda, AP reports.
Radio Uganda said 10,000 to 40,000 corpses had floated into Lake Victoria
from the Kagera River, which flows out of Rwanda's highlands.
