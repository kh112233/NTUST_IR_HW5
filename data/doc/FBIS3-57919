<F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Peter Pelinka </F>
and Tessa Prager; place and date not given: "Forty Percent and 
More"] 
  [Text] [NEWS] At the end of 1993, as a result of the 
letter-bomb series, there was a roundtable of party leaders. Do 
you fear a further polarization for the super election year of 
1994? 
  [Vranitzky] The roundtable has not contributed to improving 
the political culture. Proof of that is the publication of the 
so-called verbatim records and the fact that the meander of 
Haider's policy have been continued: First, he wants to become 
chancellor in 1998 -- which, by the way, shows that he assume he 
will nott be able to oust me earlier. Now he has suggested 
abolishing the chancellorship completely. Then, he once again 
announced what is going to happen when he is chancellor. One 
should not have too much hope for such meetings. I believe that 
the 1994 election campaign will be very active, perhaps with 
little caution regarding the choice of words. I will not 
participate in this, unless I become the target of a specific 
attack. 
  [NEWS] During the talk, did Haider apologize for calling you 
a "fascist in a pin-stripe suit"? 
  [Vranitzky] No, he just showed a seemingly obliging body 
language before he left the room. 
  [NEWS] Did you think there were too many reports about the 
letter bomb series? 
  [Vranitzky] Not generally. However, I must warn against the 
impression that right-wing extremism is rampaging in Austria. 
The problem is not the great number of right-wing extremists, 
but a certain trend toward making things seem harmless. One 
should call a spade a spade and say how things are, not more and 
not less. 
  [NEWS] In addition to the younger extremists, there are 
people like the Carinthian host [Edwin Neuwirth] of Russian 
ultranationalist Zhirinovskiy, who says that he does not know 
anything about gas chambers. 
  [Vranitzky] Like many others, I did not learn anything about 
the time after 1918 in our history lessons in secondary school. 
At the graduation ceremony, I asked my very open-minded history 
professor why not. And there he told me about incredible 
problems with other teachers and parents who were politically 
affected one way or other during the 1920's, the 1930's, and the 
1940's. Thus, he did not tell us anything.... I count on the 
young people and I count on this being recognized as a challenge 
to society. 
  [NEWS] Obviously, many young people nowadays use Nazi 
slogans when they want to shock others. 
  [Vranitzky] I think that one of the reasons for the lack of 
support for and orientation of these young people is the fact 
that relatively few immaterial values are being conveyed in 
families. Society is living off values that were established in 
the past and is not developing any new ones. Social policy has 
been materially oriented for too long. It is okay that school 
attendance is free, that the pensions are secure, and that the 
second year of maternity leave is financed. But one must not 
believe that one can reach sociopolitical goals with this alone. 
There is a bit more: caring, showing concern. I do not mean 
this sentimentally; I say this on the basis of the very tough 
reality, which I hear at Vienna's Meisel market, for instance: 
You only care for the foreigners -- you do not care for us. 
  [NEWS] In the summer, you defended social benefits. Now you 
are accused of cutting back social benefits. 
  [Vranitzky] The social system must once again prove how 
plausible it is. If even recipients of certain social benefits 
get the idea that one could improve something, one should not 
close one's ears to that. If such a good institution as the 
free school textbooks is criticized by parents, teachers, and 
people who are not involved all in the same way, it would be 
useful for one school to make its textbook system more 
economical and be permitted to use the saved money in a 
meaningful way. This does not call into question the instrument 
itself but improves it and gives rise to incentives for other 
things. 
  [NEWS] You are committing yourself to a new edition of the 
coalition, and [Vice Chancellor Erhard] Busek has criticized you 
for that. 
  [Vranitzky] In previous election conflicts, the Austrian 
People's Party has already suffered from the incohesiveness of 
such statements. Furthermore, I have not yet committed myself 
at all. I have said: It will be an important test for the 
government to pursue its policy, despite the turbulent election 
year. However, in the election campaign itself, we do not want 
to give rise to the impression that we are another piggyback 
party. One talks about coalitions only after the election 
results are available. 
  [NEWS] Everything points toward a "duel" between you and 
Haider. The issues will be the topic of leadership and also -- 
promoted by Haider -- the conflict of generations. What are 
your strategic plans for that? 
  [Vranitzky] Adjusting to the fact that he says something 
different on each topic every week. 
  [NEWS] How high do you set the crossbar for the elections? 
  [Vranitzky] At 40 percent and more. 
  [NEWS] When do you expect the EC referendum to be held? 
  [Vranitzky] Preconditions exist for the negotiations to be 
concluded by March. If this is the case, the European 
Parliament can ratify the results and the referendum can be held 
before summer. The earlier there is clarity the better. 
  [NEWS] One of the decisions in 1994 refers to ORF, the 
Austrian Radio and Television Corporation. Has Metelko, 
chairman of the ORF Board of Governors, discussed the early 
tender for the post of director general? 
  [Vranitzky] I knew about it. In particular, in view of the 
Strasbourg ruling [that the ORF monopoly cannot be maintained], 
it is my desire that the public institution proves its worth 
through quality and is also supported by the acceptance of the 
consumers. This also means that financial matters must be put in 
order. 
  [NEWS] The Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] often 
seems to be held up only by you. Why do you give up your 
influence on the provincial organizations? 
  [Vranitzky] Because anything else would not be good. It is 
better for the party to act on the basis of the regional 
circumstances -- in coordination and cooperation with us, no 
question about that. 
  [NEWS] Do you see any successors for you in the SPOe? 
  [Vranitzky] Several, but I hope you will not expect me to 
give any names.
