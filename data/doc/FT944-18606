FT  03 OCT 94 / Observer: Turning up the heat
This year's meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in
Madrid are attracting a less courtly breed of demonstrator than past annual
beanos.
Lewis Preston, the World Bank President, narrowly missed having a custard
pie - cunningly disguised as a birthday cake to mark the Bank's 50th
anniversary - pushed in his face at a weekend press conference. Security
staff intercepted the missile and quickly bundled out the party poopers
chanting '50 years is too much'.
Perhaps this near miss encouraged Preston to take a swipe at one of his old
banking pals, Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve board chairman. Maybe
it has something to do with his great height, but Volcker has always
appeared above criticism in the arcane world of international monetary
affairs. However, Preston couldn't resist a dig when asked to comment on
some of Volcker's past proposals for reorganising the World bank. 'Volcker
is an old friend and like everybody else he gets stuck in time,' said the
World Bank's 68-year-old president.
Britain's chancellor Kenneth Clarke was not much kinder. After hearing
Volcker express a clear preference for greater order in world foreign
exchange markets, Clarke concluded that he 'was struck how much times had
moved on'. Sic transit gloria.
