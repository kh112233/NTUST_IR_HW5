FT  15 JAN 92 / NHS chief praises success of reforms
THE National Health Service has delivered significant benefits for patients
since the government introduced its reforms, Mr Duncan Nichol, the NHS chief
executive, said yesterday.
In a report to NHS staff covering the first six months of the reforms, he
said that an extra 250,000 patients would be treated in 1991-92, an increase
of 3.7 per cent on the previous year.
There had also been 'significant inroads' in reducing the time patients wait
for treatment. The number waiting more than a year fell by 19 per cent
between March and November 1991. Numbers waiting more than two years had
fallen by 35 per cent.
In addition, record levels of child immunisation had been achieved: about
nine out of 10 children had been immunised against diphtheria, tetanus,
polio, whooping cough and measles.
Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, claimed that the report
'confounded the sceptics who said that the reforms would never work'.
He said that the NHS was 'on track' for implementing the pledge in the
Citizen's Charter that by April 1992 no patient would have to wait more than
two years for treatment.
Mr Waldegrave released details of a survey carried out in eight of the new
self-governing trust hospitals showing that almost half the 900 patients who
had visited their hospital before and after it became a trust thought that
the service had improved.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour health spokesman, said that the increase in patients
treated was much the same as that recorded in previous years.
