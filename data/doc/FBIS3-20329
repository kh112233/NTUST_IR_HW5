  [Text] Bonn -- The Central Council of German Sinti and 
Romanyi gypsies has demanded full recognition of this ethnic 
group as a "national minority" from the Federal Government. The 
government is pursuing a "policy of refusal and isolation" by 
refusing this status, Romanyi Rose, the chairman of the Central 
Council, said in Bonn yesterday. Just as the German Danish and 
Sorbs, who are better off in terms of legal rights, the 70,000 
Sinti and Romanyi gypsies with German citizenship and hundreds 
of years of links to their homes are a national and ethnic 
minority, Rose said. 
  According to Rose, the FRG has committed itself to 
recognizing and protecting minorities in several international 
treaties. However, it does not derive the necessary steps from 
that. The Sinti and Romanyi gypsies do not expect any 
improvement from the forthcoming reform of the Basic Law, 
either: No majority has been achieved for a provision that 
commits the state to the active protection of minorities. 
  Rose accused the Federal Government of "unfair methods" and 
of deceiving parliament. According to him, in its human rights 
report in December 1993 Germany had made a condition before it 
signed a relevant UN resolution. According to this, in Germany's 
view, state recognition as a minority "presupposes an ancestral, 
traditional settlement area." However, the protocol does not 
prove such a reservation. 
  Rose assessed a poll by the Emnid Institute, which says that 
68 percent of the Germans reject Sinti and Romanyi gypsies on 
principle and do not want them as neighbors either as alarming. 
In Rose's view, the reason for the Federal Government's refusal 
to recognize the Sinti and Romanyi gypsies is basically due to a 
"deeply rooted" aversion against his ethnic group.
