<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is correcting a final rule that appeared in the 

Federal Register

 of September 6, 1994 (59 FR 45972). The document amended the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of
boric acid as a stabilizer in ethylene-vinyl acetate-vinyl alcohol copolymers intended for use in contact with food.
The document was published with an incorrect Chemical Abstract Service Registry (CAS Reg.) number. This document
corrects that error.
