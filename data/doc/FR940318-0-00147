 

(d) Evaporative cooling. Evaporative Cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to reciprocating chillers
using CFC12. See the discussion on evaporative cooling under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113,
CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 
(e) Desiccant cooling. Desiccant cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to reciprocating chillers
using CFC12. See the discussion on desiccant cooling under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113,
CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 
(f) Stirling cycle. Stirling Cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to reciprocating chillers
using CFC12. See the discussion on the Stirling cycle under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113,
CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 
(9) CFC11, CFC12, and R502 Industrial Process Refrigeration, Retrofit. Please note that different
temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. 
(a) HCFC22. HCFC22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in retrofitted
industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on HCFC22 under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113,
CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 
(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in
retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12
centrifugal chillers. 
(c) R401A and R401B. R401A and R401B, which consist of HCFC22, HFC152a,
and HCFC124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in retrofitted
industrial process refrigeration. Two of the constituents in these blends are HCFCs and contribute to ozone depletion,
and production of these compounds will be phased out according to the accelerated schedule. While the GWP of HCFC22
is somewhat high, refrigerant leak regulations should 
reduce its contribution to global warming. The GWPs of the other components are low. Although these blends do contain
one flammable constituent, HFC152a, the blends themselves are not flammable. In addition, each blend is a
near azeotrope, and it does not fractionate in normal operation. Finally, leak testing of each blend demonstrated
that while the vapor and liquid compositions changed, neither phase became flammable. Testing of these blends with
centrifugal compressors is inadequate, and therefore such use is not recommended by the manufacturer. Further testing
may resolve this uncertainty. 
(d) R402A and R402B. R402A and R402B, which consist of HCFC22, propane, and HFC125,
are acceptable as substitutes for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in retrofitted industrial process
refrigeration. HCFC22 contributes to ozone depletion, and will be phased out according to the accelerated
schedule. Although these blends contain one flammable constituent, propane, the blends themselves are not flammable.
In addition, the blends are near azeotropes, 
meaning they do not change composition between the vapor and the liquid phase. Therefore, it is unlikely that the blends
would fractionate during normal operation, resulting in an enrichment of the flammable component. Finally, while
testing demonstrated that the vapor and liquid compositions changed during leaks, neither phase became flammable.
Testing of these blends with centrifugal compressors is inadequate, and therefore such use is not recommended by
the manufacturer. Further testing may resolve this uncertainty. 
(e) R404A. R404A, which consists of HFC125 and HFC143a, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration. None of this blend's
constituents contains chlorine, and thus this blend poses no threat to stratospheric ozone. However, HFC125
and HFC143a have very high GWPs. EPA strongly encourages recycling and reclamation of this blend in order to
reduce its direct global warming impact. 
Although HFC143a is flammable, the blend is not. It is an azeotrope, so it will not fractionate during operation.
Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable. 
(f) R507. R507, which consists of HFC125, HFC143a, and HFC134a, is acceptable
as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in retrofitted industrial process refrigeration.
None of this blend's constituents contains chlorine, and thus this blend poses no threat to stratospheric ozone.
However, HFC125 and HFC143a have very high GWPs, and the GWP of HFC134a is somewhat high. EPA strongly
encourages recycling and reclamation of this blend in order to reduce its direct global warming impact. Although
HFC143a is flammable, the blend is not. It is a near azeotrope, so it will not fractionate during operation.
Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable. 
(g) Ammonia. Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in retrofitted
industrial process refrigeration. See the discussion on ammonia under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113,
CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(h) Propane. Propane is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, and R502 in retrofitted
industrial process refrigeration equipment. Propane does not contribute to ozone depletion and it exhibits a negligible
GWP. Propane is flammable, and as such EPA recommends but does not require that it only be used at industrial facilities
which manufacture or use hydrocarbons in the process stream. Such facilities are designed to comply with the safety
standards required for managing flammable chemicals.
