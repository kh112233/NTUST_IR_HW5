FT  05 JUN 93 / Anti-racist protests planned
THREE MORE suspects were detained by the German federal prosecutor yesterday
for questioning over the murder of two Turkish women and three children in
an arson attack last weekend, as preparations went ahead for mass
anti-racist demonstrations across the country.
Tens of thousands of Germans and Turks are expected to join in the protests
at Solingen, the steel-making town where the deaths occurred, and other
cities such as Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and Stuttgart.
There were fears yesterday that there could be violence, with clashes
between extreme Turkish nationalist groups, such as the so-called Grey
Wolves, Kurdish dissidents, and German skinhead gangs.
Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, warned a parliamentary committee the
Solingen attack could trigger new confrontations between extreme-left and
extreme-right gangs.
However, the organisers are calling for a mass demonstration in favour of
good race relations. In Hamburg, for example, they are hoping for 100,000
people in a 'chain of ideas', each with a proposal on how to combat racism.
A survey out yesterday showed that an overwhelming majority of Germans -
more than 70 per cent - would be happy to grant long-standing Turkish
residents the right of dual nationality. At the same time, some 44 per cent
of those questioned by the Wickert opinion research institute doubted that
such a dual nationality would do much to improve race relations.
There was a significant drop last month in the number of foreigners seeking
political asylum in Germany - a main source of racial tension over the past
two years.
