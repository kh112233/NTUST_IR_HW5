FT  06 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Front-line women
The conference yesterday reaffirmed the decision taken last year to use
quotas to ensure that Labour has more women MPs in the next parliament, Ivor
Owen writes.
Ms Clare Short, shadow cabinet member with responsibility for women,
forecast that as a result there would be between 80 and 90 women on the
Labour benches compared with the present 38.
All-woman shortlists are to be used in half of all 'winnable seats' that
become vacant.
Ms Short successfully called for the approval of a statement by the national
executive committee urging 'flexibility and sensitivity' in operating quotas
under an agreed system of regional consensus. She said there was no other
way of 'guaranteeing progress'.
Ms Short challenged those who argued that merit alone should determine the
choice of parliamentary candidates to say if they believed that most MPs
were second rate because they were selected from an all-male shortlist.
