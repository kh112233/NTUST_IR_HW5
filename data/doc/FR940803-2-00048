<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 This is notice in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of a limited field of use exclusive license
in the United States to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Applications Numbers 07/695,024 filed on May
6, 1991 and 07/879,649 filed on May 6, 1992 entitled ``Recombinant Virus Expressing Human Carcinoembryonic Antigen
and Methods of Use Thereof'', to Therion Biologics Corporation, having a place of business in Cambridge, MA. The patent
rights in these inventions have been assigned to the United States of America. 


The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within 60 days from the date of this published
Notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the licenses would not be consistent
with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
The field of use would be limited to the use of recombinant vaccinia and/or swinepox viruses expressing carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) gene or portions thereof with the aim of eliciting an immunogenic response. 
The immune response 

in vivo, 

elicited after exposure to the recombinant virus would be directed against malignant cells expressing CEA. The purpose
of the license is to develop vaccinia and/or swine pox virus based vaccines directed against cancers expressing CEA.

Requests for a copy of these patent applications, inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated
license should be directed to: Mr. Daniel R. Passeri, Office of Technology Transfer, National Institutes of Health,
Box OTT, Bethesda, MD 20892. Telephone: (301)-4967735, ext. 244; Facsimile: (301) 4020220. Properly
filed competing applications for a license filed in response to this notice will be treated as objections to the contemplated
license. Only written comments and/or application for a license which are received by the NIH Office of Technology
Transfer within sixty (60) days of this notice will be considered.
