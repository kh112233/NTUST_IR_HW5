FT  08 AUG 94 / Clashes break out in Havana
Thirty-five people, including 10 policemen, were injured in street clashes
in Havana, the Cuban capital, last Friday in which a crowd throwing stones
clashed with police, the Sunday newspaper Juventud Rebelde said, Reuter
reports from Havana.
Those injured included a policeman who suffered serious neck injuries after
being hit by stones and beaten, and a member of a civilian law enforcement
brigade who lost an eye when he was hit by protesters. Police fired during
the disturbances, but apparently in the air and it was not clear if live
bullets were used.
The clashes along a stretch of Havana's Malecon seafront drive were the most
serious disturbances in Havana for decades. The newspaper said that
'important groups' of those involved in the unrest were in detention and
would be tried and punished with severity.
President Fidel Castro has blamed the unrest on the US, saying it wants to
create disorder in Cuba and dubbing those involved in the clashes
Washington's 'fifth column' against the revolution.
The disturbances were linked to the hijackings of three ferry boats from
Havana bay towards the US in the space of nine days.
Authorities called on citizens to attend a gathering in Havana's Revolution
Square yesterday evening in homage to a policeman who was killed in the last
of these hijacks.
