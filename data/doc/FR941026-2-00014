SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

35 U.S.C. 209(c) provides the Department with authority to grant exclusive or partically exclusive licenses in Department-owned
inventions, where a determination can be made, among other things, that the desired practical application of the
invention has not been achieved, or is not likely expeditiously to be achieved, under a nonexclusive license. The
statute and implementing regulations (37 CFR 404) require that the necessary determinations be made after public
nortice and opportunity for filing written objections.





Sugar Land Products Co., of Houston, Texas, has applied for a partially exclusive license to practice the invention
embodied in U.S. Patent No. 4,442,018, for fields of use of the transportatin industry, the construction industry
and the agriculture industry, and has a plan for commercialization of the invention for those fields of use.

The proposed license will be partically exclusive as defined above, subject to a license and other rights retained
by the U.S. Government, and subject to a negotiated royalty. The Department will review all timely written responses
to this notice, and will grant the license if, after expiration of the 60-day notice period, and after consideration
of written responses to this notice, a determination is made, in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c), that the license
grant is in the public interest.
