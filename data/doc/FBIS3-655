  [Text] Mmabatho March 11 SAPA -- Three Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement; AWB] members were 
executed by a member of the Bophuthatswana security forces after 
the thousands-strong right-wing contingent was run out of town 
by the Bophuthatswana Defence Force on Friday [11 March]. 
  Journalists were shot at, beaten and kicked and had their 
equipment stolen by the retreating right-wingers, witnesses 
said. This followed the five- to six- minute firefight in 
downtown Mafikeng in which at least one AWB member and two 
civilians were killed. 
  The incident occurred near the Mafikeng police station where 
three AWB members were shot, NEW YORK TIMES Correspondent Bill 
Keller told SAPA. "We came across two guys next to three AWB 
members who had been shot. One was already dead and the the 
other two were wounded. One of the people wearing green 
uniforms calmly went up to them and shot five or six rounds into 
the two guys," Mr Keller said, calling the killings an execution. 
  Two senior journalists were severely beaten and kicked by 
the 
retreating right wingers outside Mafikeng as the last of them 
left the town. Both John Battersby of the CHRISTIAN SCIENCE 
MONITOR and Paul Taylor were set upon by the men who hit and 
kicked them in the head and body. The two men were beaten when 
they went to the aid of a SATV [South African TV] crew of which 
journalist Nan Roux was a part, after the retreating men had 
fired shots at the crew. 
  The SATV crew was filming the tail end of the AWB's retreat 
from Mafikeng from a garage at the edge of town. "We thought 
they had all gone when three more bakkies [pickup trucks] came 
by. They stopped and they shot at us. We hit the ground and 
they shot again, hitting a car in which a bullet wedged itself 
into the metal of a door. Then these two journalists (Mr 
Battersby and Mr Taylor) came up and the AWB men got off the 
bakkie and laid into them. They were very badly hurt," Ms Roux 
said. 
  SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
journalist Eugene Yssel was earlier beaten and kicked at the 
AWB's so-called campaign headquarters, the Bophuthatswana 
Defence Force airfield.
