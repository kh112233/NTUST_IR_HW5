  [Text] [Announcer] The guest on Afrique Midi today is the 
Chadian civil service minister. Following the ruling of the 
International Court of Justice in favour of Chad in the border 
dispute concerning the Aouzou Strip, Abdelkader Kamougue has 
just been to Tripoli to hand over a message from the Chadian 
president to Colonel al-Qadhdhafi. Libya has not said yet if it 
will abide by the ruling of the International Court. Ghislaine 
Dupont first asked Abdelkader Kamougue if the Libyan leader 
confirmed that his country would withdraw from the Aouzou Strip. 
  [Begin recording] [Kamougue] From what I could gather, 
Colonel al-Qadhdhafi seems to accept the ruling, insofar as he 
said that as far as this border dispute is concerned, the matter 
is now closed. What does he mean by a closed matter? He said 
that a page has now been turned and that the future should be 
considered in a different light. However, we have not noticed 
any offical sign through the radio or the press since he said 
that. Nevertheless we are not losing hope since, following our 
proposal, a meeting of foreign ministers will shortly take 
place, which will enable us to go into the matter more deeply. 
  [Dupont] Do you believe that this lack of official statement 
is, in a way, a bad omen? 
  [Kamougue] We could be tempted to say that. However, since 
dialogue between the two countries is continuing, since we 
maintain our links, since we have an embassy there, and since we 
believe that the Libyan foreign minister will come to N'djamena, 
we believe that there is room for hope. 
  [Dupont] Has Chad received any assurances yet that Libya 
will 
pull out from the Aouzou Strip? 
  [Kamougue] The ruling was given, and I believe that it is 
necessary for the two countries to get closer to consider the 
conditions under which Libya could return the strip and evacuate 
it. So the issue will start being addressed at the next meeting 
of foreign ministers. 
  [Dupont] Several Chadian officials, particularly diplomats 
in 
post in Tripoli, say that the Libyans have reinforced their 
military presence in the Aouzou Strip. 
  [Kamougue] During our meeting Colonel al-Qadhdhafi denied 
this reinforcement and gave us assurances that in fact their 
presence in the zone has been reduced. Like Saint Thomas, we 
can say that we must see before we believe, so we remain somehow 
confused by all this for the time being. 
  [Dupont] Will the Chadian Government set a deadline for the 
Libyan pullout from Aouzou? 
  [Kamougue] We believe that the enforcement of this ruling 
should take place in the shortest possible time. Regarding the 
setting of a deadline, I believe that it will be possible for 
both delegations to make proposals and to find a compromise 
concerning the agenda of this pullout. 
  [Dupont] If the Libyans were to procrastinate, what could 
the 
Chadian authorities do? 
  [Kamougue] For our part, we have been choosing peace and 
justice since the 1989 Algiers agreement, and we will continue 
in that direction. We do not intend to embark on any violent 
action against Libya, we believe that the UN system should help 
us obtain the evacuation of this territory which has become 
Chadian. 
  [Dupont] Mr. Kamougue, Chadian nationals living and working 
in Libya have been rounded up in the past weeks, have you 
discussed this issue with Colonel al-Qadhdhafi? 
  [Kamougue] It goes without saying that we discussed this 
issue during our meeting, and Colonel al-Qadhdhafi allowed us to 
visit our fellow countrymen who were detained in the (Zanzur) 
camp. These Chadians were rounded up over a question of 
residence documents which they allegedly did not possess. A 
total of 365 Chadians have been rounded up, 165 of them in 
Tripoli itself, and the others shared between Sabha and Benghazi. 
  [Dupont] A communique from the Chad president's office 
implies that the aim of these Chadians was to reactivate groups 
hostile to the authorities in Chad. 
  [Kamougue] All theories are possible. That is one. But we 
hope that as far as the national question is concerned, the 
Chadians opposed to the transitional government will not take up 
arms to contest the verdict of the International Court of 
Justice. I don't think these Chadians will fall into that trap.
