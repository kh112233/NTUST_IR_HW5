<F P=106> [Dispatch: "The Ministry of Public Security Standardizes </F>
the Names and Codes of Coast Guard Boats"] 
  [Text] Hangzhou, 15 Mar (XINHUA)--To counter the chaotic 
state of marine antismuggling operations which began last year, 
in which some departments who were not involved in antismuggling 
operations were prompted by personal interests to send their own 
men to sea, leading to a number of incidents in which foreigners 
were involved, the Ministry of Public Security [MPS] issued the 
following regulations a few days ago: As of 1 April this year, 
coast guard boats that are responsible for marine security and 
antismuggling operations will all follow a standardized code 
system. Their boats are to be named in accordance with a 
nationally standardized code system beginning with "Public 
Security Border XYZ" and will be issued a forgery-proof "marine 
patrol duty pass" by the Ministry of Public Security. Duty 
personnel on board will all wear a uniform arm band for 
identification purposes. 
  Li Huan, deputy director of the MPS Frontier Guard Bureau, 
said at a coastal border guard seminar opening today that the 
standardization of boat names and codes and the requirement for 
duty personnel to wear uniform bands have been prompted by the 
need to rectify the marine situation and maintain order, and are 
part of the public security border units' effort to regularize 
their forces. A new and uniform identification system will help 
prevent other boats from going out to sea to hunt for smugglers 
while masquerading as public security border units. Domestic 
and foreign ships and the personnel on board can refuse [ke yi 
ju jue jie shou 0668 0110 2147 4815 2234 2392] to be inspected 
when a boat in violation of the above-mentioned regulation 
demands a provisional [lin shi 5259 2514] inspection.
