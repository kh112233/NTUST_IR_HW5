FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Showa Denko in red after damages
charge
SHOWA DENKO, the Japanese chemicals producer which is being forced to settle
damages claims in the US as a result of blood disorders caused by a dietary
supplement it marketed there, took an extraordinary charge of Y46.18bn
(Dollars 442m) in the half-year to June to cover the suits.
The company was able to offset more than half of this by selling land and
other assets, which brought in Y24.28bn, but it still suffered an interim
net loss of Y17.24bn, compared with earnings last time of Y1.09bn.
The food additive, L-tryptophan, was withdrawn in 1989. More than 1,500
Americans were affected, of whom some 30 died.
Showa Denko has been hoping to settle the bulk of the legal cases this year.
Its mainstream businesses, meanwhile, suffered from the economic downturn in
Japan. Parent company first-half sales were down 9.5 per cent to Y235.3bn
and pre-tax profits were halved to Y1.42bn from Y2.84bn.
For the full year, Showa Denko forecast sales down 7.6 per cent to Y470bn,
and a break-even at the pre-tax level, where in 1992 it earned Y3.36bn, but
said it could not make a projection for net earnings.
No dividend has been paid since 1990.
