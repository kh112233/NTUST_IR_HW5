  [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Despite declining numbers last 
year, one should not expect a general decline of politically 
motivated arson and bomb attacks. According to the news 
magazine FOCUS, this is what the Federal Office of Criminal 
Investigations (BKA) has noted in a confidential study. 
According to investigations, experts noted a decline of attacks 
"at a high level," since attacks went from 901 in 1992 to 540 in 
1993. A return to the situation in 1990 with 128 acts of 
violence of this kind cannot be expected, however, experts think. 
  According to BKA findings, 300 attacks last year were 
motivated by right-wing extremism. A total of 150 acts of 
violence were committed by radical foreigners. According to the 
BKA, xenophobic actions have declined clearly. In some of the 
new laender, this kind of crime went down by 75 percent. In 
1993 the most peaceful laender were Thuringia, Bavaria, and 
Saarland.
