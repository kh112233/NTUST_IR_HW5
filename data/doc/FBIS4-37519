  [Excerpt] An official meeting -- the first of its kind -- 
between Jordan's King Husayn and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin may be convened when the two sides sign a border 
demarcation agreement, expected to be wrapped up by 1 October, 
1994. 
  King Husayn has often said that any official sessions with 
Israeli leaders should not be a media show, but must be the 
result of political forward movement. Hence, King Husayn's 
rejection in January of an American proposal for a meeting with 
Rabin at the White House before the peace negotiations achieved 
a breakthrough. However, the progress achieved in Washington 7 
June when Jordan secured Israel's approval of a joint experts 
committee -- set to meet next month in the region to delineate 
joint borders -- broke the deadlock and paved the way for 
Jordanian-Israeli talks at the highest levels. [passage
