FT  20 JUN 92 / A long tradition of subtle, ingenious forgery: Two eminent
Victorians were at the centre of a literary plot that was a national
scandal. John Kitching tells the story
IN 1894 a first edition of Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnets came to light,
having apparently languished unseen for more than 40 years. As a ripple went
through the literary world few realised that it was just part of a complex
mystery, far exceeding - in the judgment of the writer Bernard Levin -
anything conceived by Agatha Christie. And at the centre of the plot were
two eminent Victorians.
Harry Buxton Forman seemed a model of propriety. He was in charge of Packet
Services at the Post Office and an editor of Keats and Shelley. But he was
also a dedicated and skilled literary forger.
Forman did not pursue his dark craft alone. His accomplice was Thomas James
Wise, 17 years his junior, a hard-headed London commodity dealer who
specialised in essential oils. Wise was president of the Bibliographical
Society and was said to have one of the finest private libraries in the
country.
Together they invented a new genre: creative forgery. Book forgers usually
copy great works, but Forman and Wise created books and editions after the
event to fill a persuasive niche. They were perhaps bibliographical rather
than literary forgers. There are similarities with Piltdown Man: a missing
link between man and monkeys is predicted and then conveniently found. The
forgers' extraordinary conspiracy is now described in a new biography by
John Collins*.
For both men, and particularly for Wise, the purpose was serious: to make
money. In the heyday of Victorian capitalism Wise saw a product to corner
the market. And Forman, who wrote of his legitimate literary works: 'My
style of writing is not what turns well to the making of pots of money,'
knew the serious cash lay elsewhere.
Some literary figures suspected Forman and Wise were up to something. But
the two were not finally unmasked until 1934, by which time Forman had been
dead for 17 years.
Forman was born in 1842 in the west country and joined the Post Office in
London in 1860. In his spare time he was a poetry critic and, along with
Trollope, ranks among the Post Office's literary luminaries. He lived in
some comfort in Camberwell, was married to Laura, and knew George Eliot.
Wise came from more humble origins, but was a successful broker and lived in
Islington. For some time he had admired Forman's scholarship from afar, but
it was to be several years before the two met and conspired. Both were
members of the Browning Society: Forman was afounder, and Wise joined in
1882. Both were also to become members of the Shelley Society. A closer
relationship seemed inevitable, and in January 1886 Wise, then 27, was
invited to Forman's house.
By this time, Forman's literary reputation was considerable. He had begun
modestly in 1869 with an article on D G Rossetti published anonymously in
Tinsley's magazine. Slowly but surely his name became part of the literary
scene. In 1871, Tinsley published Forman's first book 'Our Living Poets,'
and 10 years later he took his first steps into forgery. His method then was
to determine the course of the extraordinary forging operation.
Richard Hengist Horne, an eccentric poet and one of the subjects of 'Our
Living Poets', had written in 1867 an odic cantata for the Duke of Edinburgh
called 'Galatea Secunda'. It was never published. In 1881, Forman published
it with a 'Melbourne, 1867' imprint. The first edition imprint, albeit of
false provenance, increased the value considerably. Their subtle game was
afoot.
There is no indication that Horne ever saw the edition: if he did, perhaps
he thought of it as a quaint conceit, suggests Collins in his book. When
Horne died in 1884, Forman was left all Horne's books and papers and
appointed his literary executor. He later sold many of the works, including
Lot 108 which contained 'Galatea Secunda' 'privately published in Melbourne
1867'. He netted Pounds 200, about half his annual salary. He had started to
make money as a forger.
By the time Wise arrived on his doorstep in 1886 Foreman was ready for a
full-scale conspiracy. The idea was immensely seductive to Wise. 'The cost
of 30 or 40 copies of a slim pamphlet might be Pounds 6 or Pounds 7; the
unit cost therefore about 3s 6d or 4s: and one copy could sell for Pounds
100 (about Pounds 1,500 today). This was one of the most attractive
commodities Wise had dealt in.'
Collins suggests that while Wise entered his new role with alacrity, Forman,
though at first helpful, was later dragged kicking and screaming in his
wake. 'But once in the secret he could not get out: Wise had the drop on
him.'
The forging began in earnest, using as a printer Richard Clay of Bread
Street Hill in the City of London. J R Maylett, foreman at Clays, may have
known something was amiss (perhaps he was bribed, suggests Collins) but to
Cecil Clay, managing director, Wise was just another customer.
First a collection of Robert Browning poems was reprinted with a false
imprint giving a date before the poems were written, then some Elizabeth
Barrett Browning sonnets were given the Forman-Wise treatment. A selection
of George Eliot sonnets, first printed in 1874, was reprinted by the forgers
in 1887 bearing an 1869 imprint. Wise added a bogus note of provenance to
many of these works. Tennyson's 'The Last Tournament' was published in 1896
but bore an inscription handwritten by the supposed printer: 'Not more than
20 copies. Strahan - Ludgate Hill, 1871.'
However, at least one bookseller, Bertram Dobell, had doubts. In 1888 he
wrote: 'Shelley Society meeting: Wise is still proceeding on his wild career
of reprinting or pirating Browning.'
By 1890, Swinburne, Ruskin, William Morris, Tennyson and Thackeray had been
subjected to the forgers' treatment. Several fake volumes were sold to the
British Museum.
Perhaps the most celebrated forgery was of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's
so-called 'Reading sonnets'. It was, writes Collins, 'a daring stroke which
showed how high the forgers' confidence was rising. By forging Browning's
sonnets Wise and Forman were tampering with the most celebrated literary
love story of Victorian England.' They published the poems in 1894, bearing
the imprint 'Reading, 1847'.
For more than 40 years it had been believed that the first publication of
the sonnets was in Elizabeth's 'Poems' of 1850. But in March 1894, a note
appeared in an obscure Philadelphia literary journal saying a Browning
rarity had turned up: an 1847 edition of the sonnets. In spite of the
Reading imprint there was no printer's name and nothing to indicate it had
been produced in that town. It had, of course, been designed by Forman and
Wise and printed by Clays in the City.
Yet few eyebrows were being raised at the plethora of pamphlets and books
produced by Forman and Wise. There was to be some minor sniping at the
forgeries from about 1909, but nothing serious.
It was much later, in the 1930s, that the two forgers were unmasked. Their
downfall was brought about by two young booksellers, Graham Pollard and John
Carter. Pollard, a colourful character, claimed to have got an Oxford
half-blue in spitting, achieved by beating Evelyn Waugh over a 10ft
distance. Carter had been a scholar and taken a double First in Classics.
Carter was soon on the case of the Reading sonnets: he knew there was no
copy in Browning's library; no copy in an old binding; and no copy with any
signature inscription or mark of provenance before about 1900. But this was
all negative evidence. It was Pollard who gathered the positive evidence
through research into the chemical history of 19th-century paper. Analysis
of paper from an edition of the sonnets owned by a Flora Livingston showed
it contained a significant proportion of chemical wood pulp: a substance not
used in England until 1874. The book could not have been published in 1847.
Carter tried writing to Wise, but the reply he received was of a vague
general and dismissive nature. But it was the beginning of a dogged process
which was to assume the working title of 'Wise-cracking' and the Reading
sonnets remained the cornerstone of the investigation.
By June 1934, the embattled Wise faced ruin. News placards in the street
read: 'Famous books denounced as forgeries' and 'Faked First Edition
Sensation'. The articles were based on a book by Carter and Pollard with the
gentle, donnish title of 'An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain 19-Century
Pamphlets.' In the book, all paths seemed to lead to Wise's door: but
without absolute proof they couldn't name him as the forger. Carter and
Pollard wrote: 'Mr Wise by his credulity, by his vanity in his own
possessions, by his dogmatism, by abuse of his eminence in the
bibliographical world, has dealt a blow to the prestige of an honourable
science, the repercussions of which will be long and widely felt . . . '
The Daily Herald newspaper despatched a reporter to track down Wise: again
his defence was unconvincing - and he tried to put the blame on Forman.
Three years later, Wise too, was dead.
Wise and Forman are part of a long tradition of literary forgers: Thomas
Chatterton, piler-up of poetry, William Henry Ireland (who as Shakespeare
got his play 'Vortigem' on to the stage - although without success) and John
Payne Collier, Shakespeare's dodgy biographer. Perhaps Bernard Shaw's view
that the whole thing should be treated as a joke is the right one. Did not
the rich book collectors deserve to be humbugged by the forgers? asks
Collins in his book. The fact remains that Wise and Forman acted illegally,
defrauding both buyers and authors.
To the end, Forman, the poetry critic, wrestled with his conscience, as his
literary reputation began to suffer. In contrast, Wise, 'who did not know
the prick of conscience' was defending himself on his deathbed thus: 'I am
an old man with the crematorium facing me . . .' His final words were,
perhaps, an admission that the fraud was too complicated to describe even in
the throes of death.
