FT  18 AUG 94 / Private insurer in tobacco lawsuit
The state of Minnesota, and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, are
suing various elements of the tobacco industry to recover Medicaid and
insurance costs tied to smoking-related ailments, AP-DJ reports from New
York.
The suit, filed yesterday, is the first such action in the US joined by a
private insurer.
The state government, Blue Cross and Blue Shield are Minnesota's largest
insurers. They are suing the big six tobacco companies, claiming conspiracy,
anti-trust violations and fraud.
In the south of the US, the Mississippi state attorney-general filed a
similar suit in May, and Florida lawmakers authorised a lawsuit this year.
The Minnesota suit alleges consumer fraud, and a conspiracy to conceal the
health hazards of cigarettes and to manipulate nicotine levels.
The suit also alleges that the tobacco industry controlled the market for
cigarettes in violation of a state anti-trust law. The suit did not specify
the amount of damages sought.
A Philip Morris spokesman could not be reached immediately for comment. In
the past, tobacco companies have said no conspiracy existed.
The Mississippi suit relies on state law in respect of unjust enrichment and
breach of contract. The suit has not yet reached court.
In May, the governor of Florida signed a law that not only allows the
state's attorneys to sue to recover smoking-related Medicaid costs, but
would also deny the tobacco industry such traditional legal defence as the
argument that smokers knew the risks and chose to smoke.
Florida has not yet filed a suit under the law, partly because the tobacco
industry is challenging it on constitutional grounds.
