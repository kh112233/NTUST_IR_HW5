<F P=106> [Interview with RPF leader General Paul Kagame by Massimo </F>
Nava in Kigali; date not given: "Rwanda: Genocide Inevitable"] 
  [Text] Kigali -- At 37 years of age, and with the face of a 
math teacher, which he used to be before becoming a soldier, 
General Paul Kagame is the leader of the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] rebels which is conquering the country after seven weeks 
of civil war and massacres: at least half a million dead and 
1.5 million evacuated out of a population of eight million. 
  He met with me in his headquarters on the outskirts of 
Kigali 
at a time when the RPF was laying siege to the city: The 
appointment was agreed to three days ago with the guerrillas, 
who escorted me through this tormented country along secure 
tracks now under their control. They put me up for a night in 
Gahini, near the hospital, which is overflowing with wounded and 
mutilated. 
  [Nava] So general, is genocide the price of victory? 
  [Kagame] The victims are the consequence of Rwanda's 
political history. We had to eliminate an absolute dictatorship 
and allow more than a million exiles to return home. I myself 
had to leave the country when I was a child. This is not a 
tribal conflict, like many people in Europe think, but a war of 
liberation. Now the people are on our side because they 
understand that there is no sense in living if you do not have 
rights. 
  [Nava] But could you not have avoided the massacres of women 
and children, and tens of thousands of civilians? 
  [Kagame] The RPF is not responsible for the massacres. We 
knew that the government and the presidential guard were 
preparing to eliminate the political opposition and those social 
groups which were against the regime. The international 
observers -- who were unable to intervene -- knew this too. I 
formally accuse the international community, and I accuse France 
in particular, which supplied arms and training to the militia. 
  [Nava] You accuse France of supporting the government of 
Rwanda. Who supports and arms the RPF? You grew up in Uganda, 
studied in the United States, and were a senior official in the 
Ugandan Army. 
  [Kagame] Rwandan exiles throughout Africa and Europe are 
funding the movement. We buy arms and ammunition on the black 
market. Recently we acquired a package in Somalia. We are not 
rebels with a political color, but a patriotic movement. 
  [Nava] It is true that the majority of the victims are 
Tutsis, in other words the same ethnic group as yourself, but 
your soldiers have not been there to watch either. Tens of 
thousands of people, mostly Hutus, fled to Tanzania when you 
arrived. 
  [Kagame] We have to make a distinction between those who 
died 
in battle and those who committed atrocities against civilians. 
The presidential guard exterminated Tutsis, as well as the Hutu 
opposition. However, we are making inquiries among our soldiers 
too. 
  [Nava] If you take power, will you agree to an international 
inquiry? 
  [Kagame] With open arms. However, the observers should also 
look into the crimes committed in the past by the ruling class: 
an unscrupulous oligarchy bent on keeping its power at any 
price. 
  [Nava] The assassinated president [Habyarimana], however, 
had 
signed agreements which should have led to national 
reconciliation. 
  [Kagame] Only on paper. It was always that way in the past. 
There are various explanations making the rounds as regards the 
assassination: Some say it was a plot by the Belgians and the 
Americans to eliminate him and, obviously, there are those who 
suspect our involvement, but I think it was the work of the most 
conservative factions. 
  [Nava] Now, the Tutsis are returning to power, as in the 
past 
when they were the kings of Rwanda. The massacres could be 
repeated in a few years. 
  [Kagame] The RPF president is a Hutu. I am a Tutsi, but 
thousands of militants are Hutus. In the past, it was not the 
Tutsis who governed but, as is the case now, a small clan which 
was the expression of the king. We are seeking to build up a 
genuine national movement which represents everyone, and which 
expresses a Rwandan identity without making distinctions. We 
speak the same language and we practice the same religion. The 
conflict is not ethnic, but economic and political. 
  [Nava] Nevertheless, the rivalries and hate still run deep. 
How can one explain all this beastliness in one of the gentlest 
and most hospitable peoples in Africa? 
  [Kagame] The people have been kept in a state of 
underdevelopment and have been educated to hate to such an 
extent that they behave like primitives. However, I am 
convinced that national reconciliation is possible if there is 
economic development and democracy. 
  [Nava] All guerrilla leaders promise the same things before 
taking power. Rwanda brings to mind the Cambodia of Pol Pot. 
  [Kagame] I ask to be put to the test. We want a democratic 
system and a free market. There will be a transition period to 
pave the way for free elections. In the meantime, we are 
prepared to engage in a dialogue with everyone, even with our 
most convinced opponents. 
  [Nava] Even with the leaders of the presidential guard? 
  [Kagame] With everyone, but not with killers -- primarily 
the 
political officials in the government. Those who laid the plans 
for genocide must be punished. 
  [Nava] Is a cease-fire possible? 
  [Kagame] That is not up to us. So far, the truces have been 
broken by them. We cannot allow a truce to make more massacres 
possible. 
  [Nava] What will Paul Kagame's future be? 
  [Kagame] I would sincerely like to dedicate myself to my 
private life, to my wife and my two children who live in 
Brussels. However, I am a soldier and this is my duty. I do not 
think I will go into politics, but I do not have time now to 
think about my future. [Kagame ends] 
  The "technical" jeep with escort was waiting for him. The 
general, in an unadorned uniform, is going to the front line, 
confirming his reputation as a tough man and a fanatic for 
discipline, despite his gentle manners and soft voice. "The 
government forces are resisting, but they have wasted many 
weapons and a lot of soldiers are coming over to our side. I 
think the war will end very soon." On Saturday evening [28 
May], the government forces abandoned Gitarama, south of Kigali, 
and fled toward Zaire.
