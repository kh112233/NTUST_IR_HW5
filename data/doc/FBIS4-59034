  [Text] Tehran, May 8, IRNA -- Deputy Foreign Minister 
Mohammad Hashemi left here this morning for Johannesburg to take 
part in the oath taking ceremony of the designate South African 
President Nelson Mandela. 
  Mandela is the ever first black president in South Africa 
who 
gained victory at the general election following the abolition 
of apartheid in this country. 
  Hashemi's four-day visit to Johannesburg has been made at 
the 
invitation of the committee for the oath taking ceremony of the 
designate president. 
  He is the first Iranian high-ranking official to visit the 
country after the victory of the Islamic Revolution. 
  Following the abolition of apartheid, Iran and South Africa 
in a joint communique May 10 announced the resumption of formal 
diplomatic relations. 
  Iran cut off its relations with the apartheid regime of 
South 
Africa in the wake of the victory of Islamic revolution in 1979.
