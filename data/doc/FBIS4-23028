  [Abstract] The scientific and practical importance of data 
on the interaction of plague microbes with antibiotics obtained 
in experiments with strains isolated from natural disease 
outbreaks prompted an investigation of 50 foreign strains from 
the persons infected with plague. The strains for this purpose 
were received from the Plague Scientific Research and 
Information Center in Stavropol in cooperation with the World 
Health Organization. All strains are isolated from the patients 
whose disease is clinically manifested in the cutaneous bubonic 
and septicemic forms. In addition, five plague microbe strains 
isolated from an outbreak in Central Caucasus as well as control 
strains recommended by WHO--Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli 25922, and 
Staphylococcus aureus 25923--were included in the 
experiment. In examining the U.S. strains, streptomycin, 
gentamycin, ristomycin, kanamycin, doxycyclin, and polymyxin C 
were used. The resistance of African strains to a broad range of 
antibiotics, including streptomycin, erythromycin, monomycin, 
and lincomycin was also examined. The outcome of the experiment 
was assessed after 48 h of incubation at a 28C temperature. 
The sensitivity of U.S. and African strains of plague microbe to 
the above antibiotics is summarized; the standard strain 
sensitivity was consistent with WHO guidelines. The experiment 
makes it possible to assert that the plague microbe strains 
isolated from patients treated with large doses of antibiotics 
(usually streptomycin) display no appreciably noticeable 
tendency toward developing resistance to them. It is noted that 
in addition to streptomycin, gentamycin, doxycyclin, kanamycin, 
and tetracycline warrant further investigation. Tables 1;
