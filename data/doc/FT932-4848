FT  07 JUN 93 / Moslems 'hunted Israeli police'
Israel's police chief yesterday said a group of captured Moslem
fundamentalist guerrillas hunted policemen and had killed at least three
since December, Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
He said the group had killed at least five Israelis since December,
including the policemen.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin announced late on Saturday the capture of 120
activists in the Moslem fundamentalist Hamas movement, including a
four-member group that kidnapped and killed border policeman Nissim Toledano
on December 12.
