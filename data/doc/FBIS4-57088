  [Text] Havana, 10 May (PL) -- Today, Army General Raul 
Castro, defense minister of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed 
Forces, said the greatest attributes of the new South African 
president, Nelson Mandela, are his iron will and his 
intelligence. 
  The minister made a brief statement to the media at the 
conclusion of the main event that paid tribute to the Cuban 
fighters who died in Africa and hailed the victory of the 
African National Congress and its leader. 
  Raul Castro said Mandela was able to achieve victory because 
of his great intelligence, which he demonstrated with his 
successful performance in a multinational, multiracial, and 
multireligious country that has witnessed great hatred because 
of discriminatory practices. 
  Raul Castro concluded: We only wish him to continue 
achieving 
victories, as he has to this point, during his journey along the 
lengthy and difficult road ahead of him.
