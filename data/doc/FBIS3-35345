  [Text] Al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah, in a communique sent to 
AFP, claimed responsibility for the latest train attack and 
renewed its warning to foreigners. 
  "It is up to tourists to leave the country so as not to 
endanger their lives in the confrontation underway between the 
al-Jama'ah and the repressive regime," it said. 
  The latest attack was in retaliation for last week's death 
sentence against three al-Jama'ah members in the army, it said, 
adding that four policemen were killed for the same reason. 
  A court in Sidi Barrani, near the Libyan border, condemned 
the three soldiers to death for plotting to assassinate 
President Husni Mubarak at the local air base. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 1654 GMT on 23 February adds the 
following: "The bomb attack on a Cairo-Luxor train wounded 11 
people on Wednesday, including six foreign tourists, the 
interior ministry said. The foreigners were two Australians, 
two Germans and two New Zealanders, it said." 
  ["While MENA said the bomb exploded in a carriage, other 
informed sources said assailants hurled it at the moving train."]
