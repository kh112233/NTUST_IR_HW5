SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Background


In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of March 10, 1992 (57 FR 8460), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2A4310) had been filed by Miles, Inc.,
Mobay Rd., Pittsburgh, PA 152059741, proposing that the food additive regulations in 172.133 

Dimethyl dicarbonate

 (21 CFR 172.133) be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyl dicarbonate as a yeast inhibitor in ready-to-drink
tea beverages.
As discussed in more detail below, FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes
that the proposed use of dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) in ready-to-drink tea beverages is safe. 


II. Determination of Safety


Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called
``general safety clause,'' a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the
evidence establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)) define
safe as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended
conditions of use.''
The anticancer or Delaney clause of the Food Additives Amendment (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) further provides
that no food additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly,
however, the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself, not to constituents of the additive. That is, where an
additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, such additive is properly
evaluated under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable
certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive (

Scott

 v. 

FDA

, 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)).


III. Safety of Dimethyl Dicarbonate in Ready-to-Drink Tea Beverages


Dimethyl dicarbonate is currently permitted as a yeast inhibitor in wine and wine substitutes (dealcoholized wine
and low alcohol wine) under 172.133. In the final rules establishing this regulation (53 FR 41325, October
21, 1988; and 58 FR 6088, January 26, 1993) the agency concluded that, because dimethyl dicarbonate decomposes almost
immediately after addition to beverages, there will be virtually no exposure of the consumer to the additive from
its use in wine and wine substitutes.
Data submitted in the petition concerning the use of the additive in tea beverages are consistent with these findings
in wine and wine substitutes. Specifically, data from a study on the hydrolysis of dimethyl dicarbonate in tea showed
no detectable amount of the additive after 4 hours (limit of analytical detectability = 40 parts per billion (ppb))
(Ref. 1). Based on these data, the agency concludes that there will be virtually no consumer exposure to dimethyl dicarbonate
from the use of the additive in ready-to-drink tea beverages. Therefore, FDA concludes that dimethyl dicarbonate
itself presents no hazard to the consumer. 


IV. Safety of Substances That May Be Present in Tea Beverages Due to the Use of the Additive


Dimethyl dicarbonate is unstable in aqueous solution and breaks down almost immediately after addition to beverages.
In aqueous liquids, the principal breakdown products are methanol and carbon dioxide. Methyl ethyl carbonate, as
well as carbomethoxy amino- and hydroxy-adducts of amines, sugars, and fruit acids may also be formed in minor amounts.
Dimethyl carbonate is present as an impurity in dimethyl dicarbonate. Dimethyl dicarbonate also may react with traces
of ammonia or ammonium ions to form trace quantities of methyl carbamate, a compound that has been shown to cause cancer
in laboratory animals (Ref. 2).
In approving the use of dimethyl dicarbonate in wine and wine substitutes, the agency, in accordance with 21 CFR 171.1,
reviewed the safety not only of dimethyl dicarbonate but also of its decomposition products in aqueous beverages.
The same analysis from that review was applied by the agency in reviewing the petitioned use of dimethyl dicarbonate
in ready-to-drink tea beverages. The results of the agency's analysis of the additive's use in wine and wine substitutes
were discussed extensively in the 

Federal Register

 of October 21, 1988, and January 26, 1993, final rules, which are referenced; that analysis applies equally to the
evaluation of the petitioned use of DMDC. Aspects of the safety evaluation of the decompostion products that may result
from the use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea beverages that were not discussed previously are discussed
below. 


A. Minor Reaction Products


In its previous evaluation of the safety of minor breakdown products of dimethyl dicarbonate in aqueous solutions,
the agency concluded that there is no evidence of added risk from exposure to those minor products. For this petition,
the agency also evaluated results from an acute toxicity study on a series of putative adducts (

N

-carbomethoxy conjugates of trigallic acid, glycine, glutamic acid, alanine, proline, asparagine, cysteine,
phenylalanine, arginine, leucine, and monocysteine) that may be formed by dimethyl dicarbonate when added to ready-to-drink
tea beverages. Results of the study showed that LD

50

 for each of the adducts in mice or rats ranged between 4,600 and >15,000 milligrams per kilogram body weight (mg/kg body
weight), thereby indicating the low order of acute toxicity of those substances (Ref. 3).


B. Methanol


FDA previously estimated that the total human exposure to methanol from consumption of food that naturally contains
methanol and of wine or wine substitutes that are treated with dimethyl dicarbonate to be 50 to 60 mg per person per day
(mg/person/day) (58 FR 6088). The tolerable (safe) level for methanol is 7.1 to 8.4 mg/kg body weight (426 to 504 mg/person/day
for a 60-kg adult) based on reports of studies in human subjects (Ref. 4). The agency estimates that the methanol exposure
from the petitioned use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea would be 40 mg/person/day at tea intake of 332
grams(g)/person/day (90th percentile) (Ref. 1). This would increase the human exposure to methanol to 90 to 100 mg/person/day
(to approximately one-fifth of the tolerable safe level). The agency, therefore, concludes that there is an adequate
margin of safety between the methanol consumption from the use of dimethyl dicarbonate and the amount of methanol
that can be safely ingested (Ref. 4).


C. Methyl Carbamate


Methyl carbamate, a carcinogen, was detected in wines treated with dimethyl dicarbonate; based on a quantitative
risk assessment, the agency concluded that there was a reasonable certainty of no harm from exposure to methyl carbamate
in wines and wine substitutes (58 FR 6088 at 6090).
Methyl carbamate was not detected in dimethyl dicarbonate-treated ready-to-drink tea, using an analytical method
with a limit of detection of 5 ppb. Assuming that methyl carbamate could be present at 2.5 ppb (one-half the limit of
detection) and using an estimated value for intake of tea beverages (332 g/person/day (90th percentile)), FDA estimates
that the exposure to methyl carbamate from the petitioned use of dimethyl dicarbonate would be no more than 0.8 microgram/person/day
(Ref. 1) for individuals consuming ready-to-drink tea at the 90th percentile level. Using the same principles and
quantitative risk assessment procedure that were applied to the wine and wine substitutes, as discussed in the 

Federal Register

 of October 21, 1988, and January 26, 1993, final rules, and the exposure to methyl carbamate estimated above, FDA estimates
that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from potential exposure to methyl carbamate from the use of
dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea is 7.8 x 10

-9

, or less than 1 in 128 million (Refs. 3, 5, and 6). 
Therefore, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to methyl carbamate
that may result from the use of up to 250 ppm of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea beverages. 


D. Conclusion On Safety


FDA has evaluated all of the data in the petition pertaining to the use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea
beverages and concludes that the additive is safe for its proposed use.
To ensure the safe use of the additive in ready-to-drink tea beverages, FDA, under 21 U.S.C. 348(c)(1)(A), is amending
172.133(c)(2) to require directions on the food additive label limiting the level of use of the additive in
tea beverages to 250 ppm.
In accordance with 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection. 


V. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
