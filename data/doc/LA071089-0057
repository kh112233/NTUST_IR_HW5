A Vietnamese immigrant who offered $5,000 in a Thai newspaper for the return of 
his teen-age daughter abducted by pirates five years ago said he "has a good 
feeling" his child is still alive. Tang Bao Can, 44, and his wife, Thai Thi 
Loan, 45, of Santa Ana, placed an ad in the Bangkok Post offering the reward 
for information leading to the return of their daughter, Tang Bich Hang, 18. 
Can, manager of an auto parts store, said his daughter was taken from his arms 
in the Gulf of Thailand by suspected Thai pirates, who boarded the refugee boat 
in which Can's family and about 100 others were adrift. Can said he believes 
his daughter may have survived because the kidnapers seemed "more human" than 
other pirates who had tried to waylay the boat previously.
