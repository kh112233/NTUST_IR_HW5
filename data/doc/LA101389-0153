CHIROPRACTIC CARE 
Re: Article (Oct. 3) on chiropractors and hospitals: 
The basic issue with chiropractors is: "Does chiropractic care, such as spinal 
manipulation, really result in cost-effective treatment of musculoskeletal 
problems?" 
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona were mandated by the state to allow 
chiropractic care for state-mandated insurance programs several years ago. When 
they went back and looked at the cost of chiropractic care they found that for 
the same conditions treated by general practitioners or orthopaedic surgeons 
versus chiropractors, the cost of chiropractic care was two to three times 
greater than the medical doctors' care. 
Because of this evidence, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Arizona have 
arbitrarily limited chiropractic care in their medical programs because of the 
fear of runaway costs.
