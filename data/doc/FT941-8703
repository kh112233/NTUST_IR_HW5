FT  18 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Light-emitting diode is
'brightest yet'
The US electronics company Hewlett-Packard has developed what it claims is
the world's brightest light-emitting diode.
Clusters of the chips, which are up to four times brighter than existing
devices, could replace ordinary incandescent light bulbs where long life and
reliability are required, such as in traffic lights.
The breakthrough has been achieved through the development of a transparent
gallium phosphide substrate which enables significantly more light to emit
from the diode than did the traditional substrate, light-absorbing gallium
arsenide.
The new LEDs should be available within the next six months.
