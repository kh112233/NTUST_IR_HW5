 

(e) R404A. R404A, which consists of HFC125 and HFC143a, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC12 and R502 in retrofitted cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted
CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration. 

(f) R507. R507, which consists of HFC125, HFC143a, and HFC134a, is acceptable
as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in retrofitted cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on this
blend under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration. 


(17) CFC12 and R502 Cold Storage Warehouses, New. Please note that different temperature regimes may
affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. 


(a) HCFC22. HCFC22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in new cold storage
warehouses. See the discussion on HCFC22 under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114,
and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(b) HFC134a. HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in new cold storage
warehouses. See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal chillers. 

(c) HFC227ea. HFC227ea is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in new cold storage warehouses.
See the discussion on HFC227ea under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500
centrifugal chillers. 

(d) R402A and R402B. R402A and R402B, which consist of HCFC22, propane, and HFC125,
are acceptable as substitutes for CFC12 and R502 in new cold storage warehouses. Testing of these blends
with centrifugal compressors is inadequate, and therefore such use is not recommended by the manufacturer. Further
testing may resolve this uncertainty. For further 
information, see the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial
process refrigeration. 

(e) R404A. R404A, which consists of HFC125 and HFC143a, is acceptable as a substitute
for CFC12 and R502 in new cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on this blend under retrofitted
CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration. 

(f) R507. R507, which consists of HFC125, HFC143a, and HFC134a, is acceptable
as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in new cold storage warehouses. See the discussion on this blend under
retrofitted CFC11, CFC12, and R502 industrial process refrigeration. 

(g) Ammonia. Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 and R502 in new cold storage warehouses.
See the discussion on ammonia under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500
centrifugal chillers. 

(h) Evaporative cooling. Evaporative cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to cold storage warehouses
using CFC12 or R502. See the discussion on evaporative cooling under new 
CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(i) Desiccant cooling. Desiccant cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to cold storage warehouses
using CFC12 or R502. See the discussion on desiccant cooling under new 
CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(j) High to low pressure stepdown. High to low pressure stepdown process is acceptable as an alternative technology
to 
cold storage warehouses using CFC12 or R502. This process takes advantage of the work 
potential of pressurized natural gas. As its pressure is reduced from transmission pipes to the 
distribution system, the gas cools. This refrigeration is then used to cool a transfer medium 
such as water, which then cools the refrigerated space. It uses very little energy and produces 
no global warming emissions, since the gas is not burned. 


(k) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to cold storage warehouses
using CFC12 or R502. See the discussion on the Stirling cycle under new 
CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500 centrifugal chillers. 

(18) CFC12, R500, and R502 Refrigerated Transport, 
Retrofit. Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this
end-use.
