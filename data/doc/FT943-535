FT  29 SEP 94 / Tragedy leaves Swedes in shock
News of the Estonia ferry disaster yesterday instilled a deep sense of shock
across Sweden, a country unaccustomed to such a jolting catastrophe.
'Nothing like this has ever happened to us before,' said a journalist on a
leading newspaper. 'We have not been involved in the great wars of this
century, we have not suffered from natural disasters. We have not even lost
one of our soldiers in the Bosnian peacekeeping operation. It will take a
long time for the country to get over this.'
Both Mr Carl Bildt, the outgoing prime minister and his successor, Mr Ingvar
Carlsson, described the ferry sinking, as 'the greatest catastrophe in
Sweden's modern history.' Over 500 of the victims, numbering at least 800,
were Swedish. The dismay in Sweden has eclipsed even the shock of the
assassination of prime minister Olof Palme in 1986.
Sweden, often joked about for its northern reserve and tranquillity, is more
used to mobilising its aid agencies to help the victims of disaster in
faraway places than to coping with trauma at home. Yesterday, crisis groups
were set up in many cities and towns to offer support and counselling for
bereaved families.
The sheer scale of the fatalities had a profound impact on a nation of 8.5m
people. The shock was heightened by the popularity of Baltic cruises among
ordinary Swedes, thousands of whom take short excursion trips on similar
ferries to Finland, St Petersburg and the newly independent Baltic states.
The victims yesterday included a group of 53 pensioners from the eastern
city of Norrkoping, 44 retired trade unionists from the western town of
Borlange, 70 office workers from the Stockholm county police and 20 pupils
from a bible school in the central city of Jonjoping.
Mr Bildt, like many Stockholmers, recalled he had himself sailed on the
Estonia and said he knew several people aboard the ship when it sank.
