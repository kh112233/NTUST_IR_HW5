RECORD 2,700-ACRE ESTATE SEIZED IN DRUG CASE 
The wooded 2,700-acre riverfront estate of a convicted cocaine smuggler was 
seized by federal marshals Saturday in the largest land forfeiture action ever 
against a U.S. drug figure, authorities said. 
U.S. Atty. 
James West said investigators believe Frederik Luytjes had intended to return 
to the $2.8-million Mastwood estate in the Pocono Mountain region after he 
completes his 10-year prison sentence for cocaine trafficking. 
A forfeiture complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Scranton alleged that 
Luytjes had purchased the property with cocaine profits, making it subject to 
seizure under federal drug laws. 
Luytjes, 47, allegedly used his charter aircraft business, Air America Inc., to 
provide planes and recruit pilots for a smuggling operation that imported 10 
tons of Medellin cartel-supplied cocaine into the United States from Colombia 
between 1980 and 1985. 
West said Mastwood represented the largest tract of land ever seized in the 
United States in a drug-related forfeiture action. The government previously 
seized about $18 million in cash and other assets from Luytjes and his 
associates.
