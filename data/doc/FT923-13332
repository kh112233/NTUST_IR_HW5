FT  14 JUL 92 / Nucor abandons Scottish plans
THE LAST hope of reviving steel production in Scotland has vanished with the
decision of Nucor, the US steel producer, not to go ahead with a plan to
develop a steel plant at Hunterston on the Firth of Clyde, James Buxton
writes.
Nucor, which has pioneered thin slab casting technology in the US,
investigated the possibility of setting up a plant in Scotland after a
week-long visit by executives in April.
It rejected the idea of taking over British Steel's Ravenscraig complex
which closed last month, but was interested in the coastal site, and in
using some Ravenscraig workers.
Nucor has said it does not have the resources or the time to undertake a new
project at Hunterston. It believes development of the plant would be
economically viable and has not ruled out taking a minority interest in any
future scheme.
