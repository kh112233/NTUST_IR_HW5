SHEVARDNADZE TO TOUR MIDDLE EAST IN QUEST FOR PEACE 
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will begin a five-nation tour of 
the Middle East this week aimed at achieving a "tangible breakthrough" in 
settling the Arab-Israeli conflict, an official said. 
Vadim Perfiliev, a Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Shevardnadze will 
visit Syria Feb. 17-19, Jordan on Feb. 19, Egypt, Feb. 20-22; Iraq, Feb. 23-25, 
and Iran, Feb. 25-27. 
Shevardnadze's visit is evidence of an increasing Soviet role in the Middle 
East. 
According to Perfiliev, Shevardnadze's trip "will take place in the framework 
of the Soviet Union's consistent efforts to achieve a comprehensive and just 
settlement in the Middle East, taking into account the interests of all people 
involved." 
"We seek to attain a tangible breakthrough in settling this old conflict," he 
said, without elaborating. 
The Kremlin supports the idea of an international Middle East peace conference 
to be attended by the parties to the conflict, plus the United States, Soviet 
Union and other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. 
Israel has made restoration of Soviet-Israeli relations, severed by the Soviet 
Union in 1967, a precondition for a Soviet role in Mideast talks. 
Jordan's King Hussein said Sunday he was "quite optimistic" an international 
conference on Arab-Israeli peace could take place soon. 
In response to a reporter's question, Perfiliev said he does not know whether 
Shevardnadze will meet with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens or with Yasser 
Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel has refused to 
take part in any negotiations involving the PLO.
