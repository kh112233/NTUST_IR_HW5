FT  11 AUG 93 / Wind power deal
MR John Gummer, environment secretary, has given permission to Ecogen, a
company which brings together interests working on commercial wind power, to
build 15 wind turbines at Four Burrows, Cornwall. He overruled the local
authority, which had rejected the plan because of fears about noise.
