COUNTERFEITER SEIZED 
A West German man was arrested after printing 110,000 counterfeit marks, the 
equivalent of $58,000, with a color photocopying machine, police said Thursday. 
The spokesman said police got a tip and were waiting at the door of a 
photocopying center to stop the man as he tried to leave.
