INVESTMENT OUTLOOK; 
MANAGING THE NEW CHOICES; 
GOING GLOBAL: EXPLORING FOREIGN MARKETS; 
OVERSEAS INVESTING CAN BE RISKY AND REWARDING 
When Philippine President Corazon Aquino toured the United States last month, 
her agenda included an unprecedented item for a visiting head of state: the 
launch of a mutual fund. 
Like many other so-called country funds, the Philippine fund introduced by 
Aquino amid great fanfare on the New York Stock Exchange invests exclusively in 
Philippine firms, providing U.S. investors with a practical means of entering a 
risky but potentially very rewarding foreign market. 
The very existence of such a fund -- and the fact that it was received with 
tremendous enthusiasm -- illustrates the extent to which U.S. investors have 
become conscious of the opportunities to be found in foreign stock exchanges. 
Over the past five years, overseas stock holdings have become a staple for many 
investors as foreign markets have expanded and become more accessible. 
And while the foreign securities may no longer be the glamour play that they 
were earlier in the decade, they promise tremendous opportunities for the 
astute investor in the 1990s. As the much-touted globalization of finance 
continues, the big European and Asian markets will become even easier to play. 
Many developing countries will take further steps to open their markets to 
foreign investors and apply internationally acceptable trading practices, 
making the so-called emerging markets such as the Philippines less of a dice 
roll. 
And overseas economic developments such as the unified European market in 1992, 
the move toward capitalism among formerly Communist states, and the tremendous 
economic growth among the newly industrialized Asian countries mean that 
foreign markets will be impossible to ignore. 
Even today, overseas exchanges account for more than two-thirds of total 
worldwide market capitalization, prompting investment experts to say any 
reasonably diversified equities portfolio should include some foreign stocks. 
"Both theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrate very strongly that you 
increase your return and reduce your risks by adding foreign securities to your 
holdings," declares David R. Kenerson Jr., senior vice president at Van Eck 
Associates, a New York fund management firm. 
But buying foreign stocks is trickier than it sounds, even though the logistics 
are simpler than they used to be. Experts who tout the opportunities overseas 
are quick to point out that the unwary amateur can easily get burned. 
So when your long-lost cousin from the old country calls you with a stock that 
just can't miss, consider the following: 
* The biggest factor influencing your eventual return will almost certainly be 
the currency exchange rate, not the performance of an individual company. 
* The smaller the exchange and the smaller the stock, the greater the 
difficulty in buying and selling. Some foreign securities (like some small 
domestic stocks) can be very thinly traded and, therefore, it can be very 
difficult to find buyers. And on European exchanges, the time between the trade 
and the final settlement of the transaction tends to be extremely long. 
* In less-developed markets, the spreads on securities -- the difference 
between the price offered by a seller and the price a buyer is willing to pay 
-- are often in the 5% to 10% range, much higher than in many industrialized 
countries. 
* Many foreign securities -- and in some cases, entire exchanges -- are 
effectively rigged by large domestic investors who can move prices at will. 
* Few countries have information disclosure requirements anywhere near as 
stringent as those in the United States, so even the investor with time and 
expertise can have a hard time getting information about companies. 
The risks and uncertainties, of course, vary dramatically from country to 
country, with well-developed markets such as London or Tokyo being far easier 
to deal with than obscure "emerging" markets in places such as Thailand or 
Greece. 
But even "safe" markets have their hazards: "The exchange rate fluctuations 
alone are very hard to cope with," notes Dan Calabria, president of Templeton 
Fund Management Inc. "You have to be extra careful about what you buy, and be 
ready to hold extra long." 
Many investment advisers recommend that individual investors who don't have 
portfolios well into the six figures avoid direct investments in foreign 
stocks. Instead, smaller players should look either to mutual funds or to 
foreign shares that are traded on U.S. exchanges in the form of American 
Depository Receipts. 
Mutual funds for foreign investing come in many flavors. Global funds invest in 
both domestic and international securities, while U.S.-based international 
funds invest in all markets except the United States. 
Individual country funds have become increasingly popular among investors who 
want to bet on the economic prospects of a specific nation, and regional funds 
that invest only in, say, Pacific Rim or European countries have also grown 
rapidly. 
Most country funds, as well as some of the global and international funds, are 
closed-end funds, meaning that a fixed number of shares trade on stock 
exchanges at prices that often reflect a premium over the underlying value of 
the shares in the fund portfolio. A piece of an open-end fund, on the other 
hand, will cost exactly what the securities are worth. 
Closed-end country funds represent the only way to play certain high-risk, 
high-reward emerging markets, notably South Korea, Taiwan, and India, but the 
premiums can be quite substantial, sometimes as high as 100% above the 
underlying stock values. And if the general trend toward more open markets 
continues, such a play could backfire. 
"There's an argument for looking beyond" the status quo in promising but closed 
markets, observes Mark Sladkus, a vice president at Morgan Stanley. "Why pay a 
premium if the market is going to open up anyway?" 
The other simple way to play foreign stocks is by way of American Depository 
Receipts, which are basically shares in foreign companies held in trust by U.S. 
investment houses. Many big-name foreign firms have ADRs, which do not protect 
investors from currency risks but can be bought and sold in dollars just like 
U.S. stocks. 
The problem with ADRs is precisely that they are available only for the big, 
boring blue chips. ADRs in Siemens, Sony, or Telefonica represent a good way to 
diversify a portfolio, but they won't make anyone rich in a hurry. 
The same can't be said for investments in a small, emerging market such as 
Malaysia, which Christian Wignel, chief investment officer for GT Capital 
Management in San Francisco, says represents a good example of the risks and 
rewards of emerging markets. 
"It used to be a commodity-driven economy -- an exporter of rubber, crude oil 
and tin -- but now the manufacturing sector is growing rapidly. It's coming to 
resemble the other economies of Asia, but labor costs are 50% lower, it has a 
very good infrastructure, and lots of open space," Wignel notes. 
Further, Malaysia boasts a long-established stock exchange, and corporate 
earnings are now growing rapidly along with the economy as a whole, Wignel 
adds. 
Still, there are risks: Dilution of share prices by huge stock issues and 
manipulation by big local players can be a problem, Wignel says. And daily 
turnover can be quite low. "You have to take a long-term strategic view," 
Wignel concludes. 
The importance of being patient when investing in foreign securities overseas 
is basic, since quick hits represent little more than bets on short-term 
exchange rate fluctuations. And that's especially true for those who would 
shrug off the experts and invest directly in foreign markets. 
It can be done: Most major brokerage houses have foreign desks that can buy 
stocks for clients, though many won't be bothered with small, odd-lot purchases 
or markets such as Italy that have serious settlement delays. 
If you're determined to try, be sure to gather as much information as possible 
about the characteristics of the market by consulting a source such as GT 
Capital's Guide to World Equity Markets. There you'll find minutia such as the 
number of brokerage firms on the Chilean exchange as well as substantive tips.
