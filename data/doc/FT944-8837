FT  18 NOV 94 / Samsung accused of industrial espionage
Samsung Heavy Industries faced a storm of criticism yesterday after being
accused of industrial espionage, allegations which may cost the company its
entry into car-making, officials and analysts said, Reuter reports from
Seoul.
The state-owned Korea Heavy Industries and Construction said it had lodged
an industrial espionage complaint against Samsung Heavy, the shipbuilding
and heavy equipment arm of Samsung Group.
A KHIC spokesman said his company lodged the complaint with local police in
the southeastern city of Changwon after a KHIC worker detected four Samsung
engineers taking pictures of production facilities. He said the photographs
showed that Samsung wanted information about the production, setting up and
operation of KHIC cranes.
In its rebuttal, Samsung Heavy said the crane in question was old and there
was nothing valuable to know about it.
Analysts said the case could seriously damage the credibility Samsung has
tried to build up in its efforts to win government approval for its plans to
enter the car market. The company has for two years been trying to move into
the highly competitive car market. 'Samsung has so far been unable to
explain how its car business will be good for the national economy,' said an
Economic Planning Board official.
Seoul's trade ministry said Samsung's entry to the car market might cause
overproduction, as three big carmakers were already vying for a share of the
crowded market.
The company faced severe criticism from established carmakers when it was
accused of attempting a hostile takeover of Kia Motors in October 1993.
Analysts said Samsung feared it was leaning too heavily on the service and
light industrial sectors, compared with such rivals as the Hyundai Group and
the Daewoo Group.
They said manufacturing accounted for less than half of Samsung's sales last
year, while making up more than 90 per cent of Hyundai's sales and more than
85 per cent of Daewoo's sales.
