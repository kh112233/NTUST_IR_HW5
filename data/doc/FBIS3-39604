  [Text] The Belgian commissioner for refugees has refused 
right of asylum to the alleged ETA [Basque Fatherland and 
Liberty] collaborators Raquel Garcia Arranz and Luis Moreno 
Ramajo because this right cannot be recognized in a community 
country for any citizen of another member state of the European 
Union. As you will recall, when the Belgian commissioner 
decided last December to study the asylum application which has 
now been refused, the Spanish government expressed its 
categorical repudiation. 
  The commissioner for refugees bases his decision on the fact 
that right of asylum cannot be recognized in a community country 
for any citizen of another European country because human rights 
are respected throughout the European Union. In his decision he 
also indicates that in Spain ETA sympathizers are prosecuted 
only when they commit offenses and never for their ideological, 
religious, or ethnic convictions. 
  Luis Moreno Ramajo and Raquel Garcia Arranz, who are accused 
of collaborating with ETA's Vizcaya Commando, were released last 
December after spending six months in a Belgian prison. The 
court which decided their release took into account in its 
decision the fact that the Belgian commissioner for refugees, 
Marc Bossuyt, had agreed to the processing of the application 
for political asylum made by the two alleged ETA members, who 
claimed in their application that charges against them had been 
obtained by means of torture. 
  At that time the Belgian Government promised Spain that it 
would do everything possible in order that asylum might be 
refused to the two alleged ETA members and it gave guarantees 
that they would remain under surveillance to prevent them 
fleeing. Today's decision reopens the possibility of Spain 
obtaining the extradition of Moreno Ramajo and Raquel Garcia.
