SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 451 

et seq.

) authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and maintain an inspection program designed to assure consumers
that poultry and poultry products distributed in commerce or within designated States are wholesome, not adulterated,
and are properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Under this authority, FSIS regulates the labeling of poultry and
poultry products and has established a policy on the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of poultry products.
The current U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) policy permits poultry kept at or below 40
&cir;F and above 0
&cir;F to be labeled as ``fresh.'' This policy is based on Federal regulations that set temperatures, and chilling
and freezing procedures for poultry products, and the labeling of such products.



The State of California enacted a State law (Section 26661 of the California Food and Agriculture Code) restricting
the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labels of poultry that has ever been kept at or below 25
&cir;F. Three trade organizations filed suit to prevent enforcement of the California law, claiming, among other
things, that it was preempted by the PPIA. Federal preemption authority granted in the PPIA prohibits States from
imposing requirements on the labeling of poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, Federal labeling
requirements. On April 8, 1994, a United States District Judge ruled that the labeling provision in the California
law was preempted by Federal law and permanently enjoined the State from enforcing its law. The USDA, at the judge's
request, filed an 

amicus curiae

 brief on the Federal preemption issue. A Federal appellate court, which heard argument on the appeal, has not yet ruled.





As a result of issues raised by the California law and the litigation, the Secretary of Agriculture directed FSIS to
reexamine its policy for the use of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of raw poultry products. The Secretary stated
that the current labeling policy in this area should be reexamined to ensure that it ``is reasonable and meets today's
consumer expectations.'' The Secretary also directed FSIS to ``make sure that any policy change does not open the
door to problems like the growth of bacteria that could cause foodborne illness.''

FSIS is actively pursuing the Secretary's objective to consider both the scientific bases for the policy and the consumer's
expectations and perceptions of the term ``fresh'' as applied to raw poultry. To ensure that consumers, as well as
all other interested parties, have a voice in establishing the Department's ``fresh'' policy, FSIS is holding three
public hearings. These hearings will provide consumers, processors, producers, industry, State and local government
officials, health officials, and all other interested parties the opportunity to present oral and written views
on this issue.

FSIS has scheduled 1-day public hearings at Modesto, CA; Atlanta, GA; and Washington, DC (see locations and schedules
under 

``dates''

 and 

``addresses''

 above). These public hearings will focus on specific issues regarding the industry's practices and controls, and
consumer expectations and perceptions of the term ``fresh'' on the labeling of raw poultry. Participants should
be prepared to respond to those issues which are identified below. Participants may comment on other issues relating
to the labeling of poultry as ``fresh'' that have not been identified by FSIS.



Industry's Practices and Controls



1. What are the current practices and controls used by industry (e.g., processors, wholesalers) for packaging, storing,
and transporting raw poultry products labeled as or to be labeled as ``fresh''?

2. What are the current practices and controls used by retailers for packaging, storing, and handling raw poultry
products labeled as or to be labeled as ``fresh''?

3. Typically, how much time elapses between slaughter and the sale to consumers of raw poultry products labeled as
``fresh''?
