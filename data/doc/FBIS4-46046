  [Excerpts] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The plutonium seized in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg at the beginning of May is weapon-grade 
material. As DPA learned from a well-informed source on Friday 
[27 May], the material, which was not recognized by the 
authorities for weeks, is 56 grams of plutonium-239 in powder 
form. According to the information, the highly poisonous 
material was found during the search of an apartment in Tengen 
near Konstanz in the course of investigations involving money 
forging. [passage omitted] 
  So far, no information has been provided about the origin of 
the material. On Thursday the Environment Ministry announced 
that the material probably came from Eastern Europe. The Land 
Office of Criminal Investigations (LKA) in Stuttgart, which is 
responsible for the investigations, has announced that it will 
issue a statement on Friday. The Konstanz Public Prosecutor's 
Office has not commented so far. [passage omitted]
