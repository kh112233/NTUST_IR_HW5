"Deputies Decide What To Do With Treasures"] 
  [Text] Parliamentary hearings were held yesterday at the 
Federation Council on a range of problems connected with the 
legal status and preservation of displaced cultural valuables. 
As has been noted at the committee for the questions of 
science, culture, and education, the resolution of questions of 
restitution is considerably hampered by the absence of a legal 
base for looking at the entire range of problems connected with 
restitution of cultural valuables and the absence of guarantees 
from Germany and the other states on restoring to Russia a huge 
number of works of art and archive files plundered by the 
fascists during World War II. Over those years, Russia lost 
more that 200,000 works of art. 
  The hearings were attended by deputies of both Federal 
Assembly chambers, representatives of the Russian Government, 
the president's staff, ministries and departments, science 
institutions, museums, and archives. Several reports were heard 
from scholars, jurists, and cultural figures, presenting various 
points of view on this question. The main question of these 
debates was, what is the Russian side going to take to the 
scheduled sitting of the Russian- German commission on 
restitution. At the time of going to press heated debates on 
the problem were in progress.
