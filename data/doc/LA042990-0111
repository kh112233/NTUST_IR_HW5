ANTI-ABUSE VACCINE IS THE WRONG APPROACH 
As are former Secretary of State George Schultz, William F. Buckley, New York 
Times columnist Tom Wicker, Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Freidman and 
many others, I am for legalizing drugs. And taking the profit out of drug sales 
is the only way to begin the control of such sales. 
However, the most compelling argument for legalization is not the economic 
argument. It happens to be the answer to Michael Schrage's second question: 
"Why government oversight of cocaine sales is morally superior to insisting 
that children get inoculated." 
The logical answer is obvious to any clear-thinking freedom-lover: To insist 
that children get inoculated is a forced intrusion on the bodies of our 
citizens whereas government oversight of cocaine sales simply allows each 
individual the freedom to choose, the very basis for free Western democracies.
