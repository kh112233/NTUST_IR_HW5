FT  23 AUG 93 / Observer: Enterprising
Jacques Attali is no longer president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development but tales continue to surface about his
high-handed approach to business life. Take the saga of how Attali lost his
own battle of Trafalgar despite having superior firepower on his side.
Early on in the EBRD's long campaign to find the right sort of London
headquarters, Attali set his sights on a newly refurbished property
overlooking Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square. Called Grand Buildings,
appropriately enough, it was next door to Whitehall, parliament and the
City, not to mention the West End.
Unfortunately, the building was occupied by Enterprise Oil and when Attali
broached the subject of whether the company might like to serve its country
by moving out, he got a polite refusal. Attali did not give up and in a
fairly short space of time Enterprise had been contacted by Sir Evelyn de
Rothschild, the Bank of England and Number 10 Downing Street.
However, Enterprise refused to budge and eventually Attali sailed away in
search of easier targets. Given that Elf Aquitaine, France's biggest
state-owned company, is Enterprise's biggest shareholder, the company's
bravery in the face of such odds would have deserved a mention in dispatches
in Nelson's time.
