FT  23 MAR 94 / Survey of Pharmaceuticals (1): Survival of the fastest -
Research used to be an expense which was never questioned, but not any more.
The high costs of developing new medicines, tighter regulatory demands - and
pressures on national health budgets - mean that only those groups capable
of bringing innovative preparations quickly to the market will survive
The flow of funding for pharmaceuticals research and development - the
lifeblood of the drugs industry - is under threat. Drugs companies' ability
to raise R&amp;D spending is being undermined by healthcare reforms introduced
by cash-strapped governments around the globe.
'I've never seen the like of last year before. It was grim. Nearly every
country took one route or another to cut drugs expenditure,' laments Mr Rene
Dehecq, president of Elf Sanofi, the French group.
Last year prescription drugs sales in the top 10 markets grew only 4 per
cent, according to IMS International, the market research group. The sector
is unlikely to expand faster this year.
The mood of the industry, which has been used to growth of between 17 per
cent and 20 per cent a year, has descended into deep depression.
'The climate has changed dramatically from one of expansion to feelings of
great introspection, examination and constraint,' explains Dr Leon
Rosenberg, president, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research
Institute.
Admittedly, market growth had already been decelerating before last year but
drugs companies had previously responded by cutting manufacturing, marketing
and general administrative costs. R&amp;D had remained inviolate.
Now, the precipitous rise in pharmaceuticals R&amp;D - from Dollars 5.4bn in
1981 to Dollars 26.5bn last year according to the UK-based Centre for
Medicines Research - appears to be ending. The top 10 R&amp;D spenders last year
increased their investment by only 11.4 per cent.
The deceleration in R&amp;D growth may be inevitable, according to Prof Jurgen
Drews, president of international R&amp;D at Roche, the Swiss healthcare group.
'The industry has clearly been over-spending. Global prescription sales
would need to reach about Dollars 280bn a year within 10 years to justify
the present levels of investment. The chances of reaching that figure are
more than low - they are non-existent,' warns Prof Drews.
The 10 largest prescription drugs markets - representing more than 90 per
cent of the world market - were worth Dollars 114.9bn last year.
Dr Rosenberg concludes: 'The worst case scenario would be that the
pharmaceuticals industry as we know it disappears because companies no
longer believe that there is a likelihood of generating a reasonable return
on money put into research. The heady days of R&amp;D are over.'
The impact of healthcare reform and the consequent slowing of sales growth
on R&amp;D spending can be seen in the table (see page two), compiled by the
Financial Times.
A few groups, mostly European companies with strong volume growth, have
managed to avoid slowing their investment. For example, Sweden's Astra, and
three British companies - Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham - increased
their spending by more than 20 per cent last year.
Most companies registered only single-digit R&amp;D growth, and a few - for the
first time in recent memory - actually cut R&amp;D spending last year. Among the
top 40-odd pharmaceuticals groups, five companies - three in the US, one in
Europe and one in Japan - were forced to reduce expenditure in not only
real, but also nominal, terms.
Mr Lodewijk de Vink, president and chief operating officer at
Warner-Lambert, whose drugs subsidiary Parke Davis cut its budget, explains:
'R&amp;D used to be a cost-centre that was never questioned. But the days of
macho spending are over. Current levels of spending are clearly
unsustainable and there will be more companies out there cutting R&amp;D. More
is not necessarily better.'
The dangers of cutting research and development are considerable, however.
For some groups it could prove terminal.
'Once a company starts cutting R&amp;D, then it's over. It's the lifeblood of a
pharmaceuticals company,' warns Dr Edward Scolnick, president of Merck
Research Laboratories, the US's biggest drugs group.
Mr Bill Steere, chairman and chief executive of Pfizer of the US and
chairman of the US Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, explains:
'Those companies without anything in their pipeline and with slowing sales
are going to find it increasingly difficult to justify funding R&amp;D
aggressively.
'They're going to get more and more frightened as their income recedes and
that will set up some kind of synergistic death spiral as they cut R&amp;D
because their income is dropping. They'll be killing themselves.'
The irony is that at the same time as R&amp;D spending growth is decelerating,
the scientific opportunities for creating innovative new medicines are
expanding rapidly.
Biotechnology and a greater understanding of the life and death of the cell
are opening up vast new scientific and medical horizons, according to Sir
Richard Sykes, chief executive of Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group.
'The basic biology of cellular mechanisms is becoming more and more
understood. Drug design is becoming more of a science than an art,' he says.
Dr William Scott, senior vice-president of exploratory drug discovery
research at Bristol-Myers Squibb, explains: 'The opportunities for making
better drugs are greater than ever before. In a short period of time, most
genes in the human body will be sequenced. Once we can identify the
molecular basis of diseases, then we can begin to treat them.'
The problem of how to access such new technologies is exercising the minds
of all research directors. Many are clearly irked by the view propagated by
small biotechnology pharmaceuticals groups are being left behind.
Although a few groups such as Roche and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer have acquired
biotechnology companies, others have limited themselves to small
joint-ventures, adopting a portfolio approach.
The difficulty for the pharmaceuticals companies is creating the in-house
expertise capable of judging which projects to pick.
Dr Hiroyki Nagasako, board director for corporate planning at Daiichi, the
Japanese group, explains why his company has no plans to link up with
biotechnology companies: 'There are exciting things happening in the US
biotechnology industry but frankly you need to develop proper levels of
expertise to manage these technologies and unfortunately we do not have
these skills. It's an expensive business and you can waste a lot of money.'
Given the increasingly difficult environment for pharmaceuticals companies,
only those capable of discovering and rapidly developing innovative drugs on
a global basis will survive.
Dr John McCall, executive director of discovery research at Upjohn in the
US, says: 'The right response to the new environment is clearly to develop
novel compounds. They're more fun to work with, easier to register with the
regulatory authorities and more profitable. There will be no place for
me-too, copy-cat, drugs in the future.'
Targeting innovative drugs is a high-risk, high reward strategy.
'Development is going to be riskier,' says Dr Robert Spiegel, senior
vice-president of clinical research at Schering-Plough research institute in
the US.
'There will be companies capable of discovering innovative profitable
compounds that allow them to fund further research, and then there are
others who are just going to go down the tubes.'
Meanwhile, given the deteriorating operating environment, company boards are
now insisting that money spent on R&amp;D is invested increasingly productively.
Dr Trevor Jones, Wellcome's director of research, development and medical
UK, admits: 'Until recently the pressure to look very hard at what we ought
to do has simply not been there.'
Almost all R&amp;D directors are focusing their efforts, cutting the number of
therapeutic areas they explore. They are also concentrating their resources,
taking fewer but more innovative compounds from the laboratory into clinical
trials.
They aim to develop drugs as quickly as possible in the three main markets,
the US, Japan and Europe so that the huge costs of developing the medicines
can be recouped.
The regulatory environment is not conducive to rapid development, however.
Regulatory authorities now require more than simple data proving a drug is
safe and effective. They are already demanding further data to demonstrate a
new compound is better than existing therapies.
In addition, pharmaceuticals companies are also being drawn into the
statistical and methodological quagmire of health economics as the
authorities demand data proving a medicine is cost-effective. Both trends
add time to the cost and duration of a drug's development.
Given the increasing cost of drug development and the need to focus
resources, a number of pharmaceuticals companies have reacted by forging
alliances in particular therapeutic categories.
'We need to collaborate more, not compete in basic research,' explains Mr
Robert Cawthorn, chief executive of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.
However, greater scientific collaboration, cost-cutting, and better use of
existing resources can only go so far.
'It's going to be a lot smaller industry. There's going to be a lot of
consolidation,' says Mr Steere at Pfizer.
Second tier companies will need to allocate their resources carefully,
employ considerable skill and enjoy a great deal of luck if they are to
develop the next generation of products capable of ensuring their survival
in this ever-harshening healthcare environment.
The stakes involved in playing molecular roulette are higher than ever
before. Few of those that fail to develop innovative drugs will be
independent by the end of the decade.
