help Nikkei to advance 3.2%

advance of 627.27, or 3.16 per cent, at 20,456.85, Reuters reports from
Tokyo.
Brokers said sentiment was boosted by hopes of a rate cut and also media
reports on the likely policies of an opposition coalition that hopes to form
the next government.

After the market had closed the opposition party leaders announced that they
had selected Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as candidate for prime minister.
Parliament is due to convene next week in special session to endorse the new
prime minister.
Although the market gathered pace, many investors remained on the sidelines
and trading was mostly driven by dealers, with the recently strong yen
keeping investors cautious.
Many new investment trust stock funds are being launched in the next few
days, improving supply and demand conditions in the market.
Equities opened steady, were firmer in early trade on buying by investment
trusts, and extended gains throughout the day on arbitrage-linked buying.
The Nikkei achieved a day's high of 20,473.75 in late afternoon trade.
Turnover was about 350m shares, compared to 188m on Wednesday. Advancing
issues outscored declines by a ratio of 13-to-one, with 1,004 higher, 77
lower and 79 stocks finishing unchanged.
Nippon Chemiphar moved ahead Y120 to Y1,350 as investors thought its shares
were still undervalued.

appreciated Y110 to Y2,350, Tokyo Bank Y60 to Y1,730 and Sumitomo Bank Y60
to Y2,400.

introduce plans to boost the NTT share price.

levitation. Both companies denied the media report.
Electric power shares were firmer on the yen's recent rally. Tokyo Electic
Power ended Y100 ahead at Y3,720.
Roundup
THE Pacific Rim presented a mixed picture.
AUSTRALIA closed higher but below the day's best level, helped by mounting
expectations of an interest rate cut in the wake of June trade figures, and
firm gold stocks and blue chips. The All Ordinaries index added 10.1 at
1,828.5.
Interest picked up again in Woolworths, with 7m shares changing hands. The
stock rose a cent to ADollars 2.84.
SINGAPORE was led forward by a technical rebound in Sembawang Shipyard and
light buying in some index stocks. The Straits Times Industrial index rose
12.81 to 1,807.02.
Sembawang added 20 cents at SDollars 11.10, while rumours of a share
placement helped Cerebos to rise 30 cents to SDollars 6.05.
NEW ZEALAND was propelled to another three-year high by further heavy trade
in Telecom, and the NZSE-40 capital index gained 17.34 at 1,782.31.
Telecom was volatile after reporting first-quarter profits of NZDollars
118.2m, a strong outlook for the year and a proposed share buy-back. The
stock finished 8 cents ahead at NZDollars 3.54.
BOMBAY surged ahead in hectic midsession trading, spurred by speculators and
foreign institutional investors after a victory for Prime Minister Narasimha
Rao in a no-confidence vote late the previous day. The BSE index finished 83
stronger at 2,232.67.
KARACHI continued to retreat, with the KSE-100 index losing 29.72 to
1,374.18. It was the second consecutive day of falls after a nine-day period
of rapidly rising prices.
TAIWAN finished mixed amid profit-taking after early speculative gains were
recorded on hopes of easier monetary policy. The weighted index, which rose
more than 30 points at one stage, ended just 2.99 up at 4,022.62. Turnover
shrank to a slow TDollars 13.58bn from Wednesday's TDollars 17.41bn.
Acer, which said estimated after-tax group profits rose to USDollars 16m in
the first half of 1993 from USDollars 2m a year earlier, firmed 10 cents to
TDollars 25.40.
HONG KONG finished narrowly mixed, with the Hang Seng index 3.28 easier at
6,899.93. MANILA paused after its record-breaking run and the composite
index slipped 2.63 to 1,738.34. SEOUL saw a wave of institutional selling
which left the composite index 5.82 lower at 743.21.
