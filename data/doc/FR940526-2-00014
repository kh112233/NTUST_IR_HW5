Description of Project:

 The proposed pumped storage project would consist of: (1) An upper reservoir having a 580-acre surface area and a 26,000-acre-foot
storage capacity at water surface elevation 680 feet msl, created by a 225-foot-high, 9,800-foot-long dam, a 95-foot-high,
700-foot-long dike, and a 35-foot-high, 1300-foot-long dike; (2) a 300-foot-long, 110-foot-wide channel leading
to a submerged intake structure; (3) a shaft and tunnel trifurcating into three 20-foot-diameter steel-lined tunnels;
(4) an underground powerhouse containing three reversible pump-turbine units rated at 330MW each operated
at a 450-foot head; (5) a 1,500-foot-long powerhouse access tunnel and an 18-foot- diameter vent and cable shaft;
(6) three concrete-lined tunnels leading to an outlet structure in Lake Clarke; (7) an above-ground switchyard;
(8) a three-mile-long, 250-kV transmission line; and (9) appurtenant facilities. Lake Clarke, an existing reservoir
formed by the Safe Harbor Dam (FERC Project No. 1025) would be utilized as a lower reservoir.

Core boring of the foundation overburden and underlying rock formation would be required. Applicant estimates that
the cost of the studies under the terms of the permit would be $235,000. Project energy would be purchased from and sold
to local utilities. A portion of the proposed project boundary for Project No. 11446 lies within the approved project
boundary for licensed project No. 1025. However, the proposed project facilities could be mutually compatible.




l. This notice also consists of the following standard paragraphs: A5, A7, A9, A10, B, C  D2.
