FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (2): Fresh signs of
confidence - The Economy: prospects are promising, but a threatened trade
war between the US and China could injure Hong Kong's manufacturing
industry.
HONG KONG has the sort of economic problems that many a recession-obsessed
finance minister would sell a grandmother for: it saw real growth below five
per cent last year; there are acute labour shortages, with unemployment
below two per cent; it is struggling to take the steam out of a residential
property boom that lifted prices by 50 per cent last year; domestic exports
stagnated as manufacturers shifted operations over the border into China  -
moves that lifted re-exports by 28 per cent. It seems that every blessing is
mixed.
More genuine headaches hover, nevertheless. Inflation sticks doggedly over
10 per cent, driven by the labour shortages. Most unnervingly, a threatened
trade war between the United States and China could injure many of the
territory's toy, electronics and garment manufacturers. It is also unnerving
for an economy dominated by exports to see main export markets like the US
and the UK still deep in recession, with Japan and Germany slowing down.
A year ago, there was much greater cause for gloom. The Gulf War cast a
shadow over the world's economies, and brought Hong Kong's
critically-important tourist industry to a juddering halt. The war came as
the second body-blow to tourism in the territory: the Tienanmen massacre in
Beijing in June 1989 brought tourism in China to a grinding halt, and with
it the number of visitors transiting Hong Kong.
The ostracism of China that followed Tienanmen hurt exports from the
mainland, denting the volume of re-exports through Hong Kong. The result was
that in 1990, growth in the economy slowed to 2.8 per cent, while Hong
Kong's container port lost its place as world leader to Singapore.
The rebound since then has been strong. Tourist arrivals recovered to pass
6m in 1991 as Taiwanese visitors have poured into mainland China. This has
lifted hotel occupancy rates back above 75 per cent, even though eight new
hotels opened during the course of the year. Tourism earnings reached about
HKDollars 40bn for the year.
While exports to the US fell by 8 per cent on the year, and sales to Japan
stagnated, exports to Germany in particular, and Europe in general, more
than compensated, lifting total exports by almost 20 per cent for the year.
Hong Kong stands as the world's 11th largest trader, with exports of
HKDollars 89bn in 1991, and imports of HKDollars 90bn making a visible trade
total of HKDollars 179bn.
The Kwai Chung terminal handled 6.2m units over the year  - a record, and 20
per cent better than 1990. The terminal has recovered its leading world
position, once again leading Singapore and Rotterdam.
Consumer spending rose by almost 20 per cent, while residential property
prices leapt by 50 per cent in a six-month period, and are expected to surge
further ahead this year. This has provided a strong underpinning to the
local stock market, which rose by more than 40 per cent on the year,
bettered only by Mexico.
Stock market confidence has also been bolstered by the successful settlement
in January of a long-simmering dispute between the US and China on the
protection of patents and copyright.
Whether this confidence can be sustained will depend critically on a much
more serious and wide-ranging trade conflict between China and the US that
could jeopardise China's most favoured nation (MFN) status, due for renewal
in June.
It has become clear that loss of MFN status, which would lead to duties on
many Chinese exports of 100 per cent and more, would have a catastrophic
effect on the fast-growing export economy of southern China. Hong Kong's
manufacturers in China could not expect to be unscathed: they account for
about 25,000 factories, employing almost 3m people. As re-exports through
Hong Kong would be decimated, the territory would suffer indirectly as as
the volume of freight passing through the container port slumped.
It is estimated that port throughput would fall by 25 per cent, with more
than 40,000 jobs being lost in Hong Kong, and GDP growth cut by about 1.5
per cent.
Needless to say, the Hong Kong government, and manufacturing interests, are
lobbying Washington hard to prevent a trade war with China. But in an
election year, they are nervous that both Congress and the Bush
administration could act unpredictably.
With the exception of the MFN cloud, economic prospects otherwise appear
more promising. The government is forecasting economic growth to reach 5 per
cent this year  - below the 1980s average of 7.8 per cent, but respectable
by world standards.
Agreement with China to build a new airport in Hong Kong, which will involve
projects worth more than HKDollars 100bn over the coming six years, means
there will be strong domestic impetus behind economic growth, with labour in
very short supply for several years to come. The US market may take some
time to provide a fillip to exports, but growing demand throughout Asia
(including China) is likely to provide important compensation.
Most significant of all, the 1990s are likely to see the progressive decline
of Hong Kong as a manufacturer, with most production already shifting over
the border into China. Instead, the territory is emerging as a major
entrepot for China, and the effective capital of a south China region
encompassing 120m people in Guangdong, Fujian and Taiwan. It will also be
critical as a services hub for an increasingly prosperous east Asia region,
providing financial and business services, telecommunications links, and a
pivotal port and airport.
All in all, Britain's recession feels light years away.
