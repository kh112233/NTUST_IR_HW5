  [Text] The king has assigned the foreign minister to act 
as his representative at the inauguration ceremony of the new 
president of the Republic of South Africa. 
  In response to an invitation from the president of the 
Supreme Court of South Africa, (N.N. Corbeck), that the king 
send his representative to attend the inauguration ceremony of 
the new South African president scheduled to be held in Pretoria 
on 10 May, his majesty the king has graciously appointed Foreign 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri and a delegation from 
the Thai Government to represent him at the ceremony. The 
delegation, led by the foreign minister, is scheduled to be in 
South Africa 8-10 May for the ceremony. 
  The presence of the Thai delegation at the ceremony will 
promote the strengthening of relations between Thailand and 
South Africa. Thailand sent a delegation to observe the first 
free election in South Africa on 26-28 April, during which a 
large number of people cast their ballots. Although 
vote-counting is still under way, it is believed the ANC party 
will win a majority of votes and that Nelson Mandela of the ANC 
will be elected the country's new leader, replacing President 
F.W. De Klerk.
