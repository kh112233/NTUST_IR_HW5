FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Panel to review rules complaints
THE World Bank has voted to set up an inspection panel to review complaints
from board members or people affected by its loans, completing a series of
far-reaching reforms of its operating practices.
The three-member panel will investigate complaints by any party which
believes it has been adversely affected by the bank's failure to follow its
own rules and procedures.
The move follows an earlier decision by the bank to expand its policy on the
disclosure of information and a far-reaching reform of management practices
intended to shift its culture away from a concentration on lending and
towards effective implementation of the projects it lends for.
New inspection procedures have been a central demand of non-governmental
organisations which monitor the World Bank since the controversy last year
over the Narmada dam project in India.
The bank eventually set up an ad hoc inspection commission for Narmada, and
the Indian government withdrew its request for bank financing after a
critical report.
Environmentalists' demands have been echoed in the US Congress this year
during debate over the US contribution to the International Development
Association, the World Bank unit which lends money at low interest rates to
the poorest countries.
Mr Barney Frank, the Massachusetts congressman who heads the committee
dealing with the IDA legislation, has negotiated an authorisation for only
two of the US's three scheduled contributions of Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds
830m) each.
Mr Frank said there was still some uncertainty over how the reforms would
work in practice.
