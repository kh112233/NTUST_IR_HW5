  [Text] A Chadian ministerial delegation has arrived in the 
Libyan capital Tripoli to discuss Libya's withdrawal from the 
Aouzou Strip. As the delegation arrived, the Libyan press was 
calling on Chad to reconsider its relations with Paris. It has 
appealed to Ndjamena to cut its ties with France. The interest 
of the Chadian people, writes the Tripoli daily, AL-SHAMS, is to 
prevent the return of the colonialists in order to consolidate 
its relations with neighboring states. These comments 
undoubtedly reflect an official viewpoint. The same tone can 
be found in the columns of the daily AL-JAMAHIRIYAH, where 
France's involvement in Chad is described as harmful. 
  These anti-French attacks come at a time when Ndjamena is 
trying to obtain Libya's withdrawal from the Aouzou Strip. 
After the failure of initial contacts in Ndjamena on 17 March, 
Chad threatened to refer the dispute to the United Nations 
Security Council in order to force Libya to respect the verdict 
of the International Court in The Hague, which recognizes Chad's 
claim to the Aouzou Strip. 
  In this context, Libya's attacks against France look like a 
maneuver aimed at delaying its withdrawal from the Aouzou Strip. 
Moreover, Tripoli has had a grudge against France ever since 
France blamed Libyans for the bomb attack which downed a UTA 
plane in 1989. On the basis of a military accord with Chad, 
France has a military presence in Chad with the Epervier 
operation, which is not of course to Libya's liking.
