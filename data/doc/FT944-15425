FT  18 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: US sellers of BP
News that US investors have continued to reduce their holdings in BP in
recent weeks left the shares slightly under the weather and finally a penny
easier at 421 1/2 p, although dealers were at pains to point out that the
stock had outperformed the market by a substantial amount this year. And the
stock price was helped by bullish noises from Lehman Brothers, the US
brokerage.
BP said ADRs issued by Morgan Guaranty Trust of New York accounted for 19.54
per cent of BP's issued capital, or 1.07bn shares, down from a previous
level of around 19.7 per cent and a high point of above 26 per cent last
year. BP shares reached an all-time high of 430p last month.
Shell edged up 3 to 730p as the market responded to a bullish press report
on the outlook for petrochemicals.
Exco, the money broking group which came to the market in the summer at 175p
a share, lost 15 at 179p, after 180p, as the market reacted badly to news of
the resignation, from December 31, of Mr Ron Sandler, the chief executive.
He will be succeeded by Mr Peter Edge, who currently runs Exco's money
broking business.
Mr Sandler joined Exco in April last year and is thought to have crossed
swords with the rest of the broker's board, according to dealers. 'It looks
bad so soon after the flotation,' said one dealer.
Exco reiterated the view that its performance for the year 'will be
satisfactory' but also warned of subdued trading in the third quarter.
The dollar's retreat affected HSBC, whose fortunes are viewed as linked to
those of Hong Kong. HSBC shares, which began to weaken late last week,
slipped 7 to 716p.
Guinness put on 5 at 465p, with NatWest Securities adding the shares to its
Top 15 performing stocks. Highland Distilleries dipped 15 to 419p in spite
of improved half-year profits and an extra 0.66p on the interim dividend.
Northern Ireland Electricity was one of the star turns in a generally
buoyant electricity sector, the shares climbing 10 to 385p after the company
said it is looking at ways of restoring the electricity transmission link
with the Republic of Ireland, a move long viewed as bullish for NIE.
Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca was helped by news that it hoped to extend the
range of its prostate cancer drug, Zoladex, in the US. The shares rose 9 to
833p.
Rival Glaxo was assisted by the publication of a large trade carried out two
working days previously at above the current market price. A block of 4.4m
shares was placed at 620p a share and the underlying stock moved forward 3
to 615p in spite of a persistently weak US dollar.
The latest national newspaper circulation figures acted on various media
stocks. Mirror Group Newspapers was 2 firmer at 134p after its flagship
paper recorded a 0.58 per cent rise in circulation against 1/2 per cent fall
in the Sun, whose parent company News International closed unchanged at
149p. Telegraph shares were down 5 at 341p and Sunday Telegraph sales were
down on the month.
Cable and Wireless's recent bout of outperformance triggered some switching
by action funds out of C&amp;W, 7 off at 414p, and into BT, up 6 at 400 1/2 p.
In an otherwise quiet property sector, MEPC fell 10 to 432p following a
downgraded net asset valuation by BZW.
