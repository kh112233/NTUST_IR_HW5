BIRMINGHAM STEEL PLANS MILL IN PHOENIX 
Birmingham Steel Corp. will build a $100-million steel minimill west of Phoenix 
as a replacement for the company's aging plant at Emeryville, Calif. 
The mill, which will produce 500,000 tons of products annually, will generate 
250 jobs and an annual payroll of $10 million. 
James A. Todd, the Alabama company's president and chief executive officer, 
said one reason for the move from Emeryville was better access to markets in 
the Southwest, including Southern California.
