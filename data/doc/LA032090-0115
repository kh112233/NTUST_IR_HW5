Unocal Chairman Backs Boost in Gas Tax: Richard Stegemeier said Congress should 
consider hiking gasoline taxes as a way to pay for cleaning up the environment 
or upgrading transportation. "It's well known that gasoline taxes in the United 
States are ridiculously low compared to the rest of the world," he said at the 
annual meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in Orlando, Fla. 
He noted that U.S. motorists pay about $1 a gallon, inclusive of tax, compared 
to $3 in Europe and Asia.
