FT  17 MAY 94 / Eastleigh by-election expected on June 9
The Eastleigh by-election is likely to be held on June 9, the same day as
the European elections, 9, Kevin Brown writes.
The Liberal Democrat party is regarded as almost certain to win the seat,
which was held for the Conservatives by the late Stephen Milligan with a
majority of 17,702.
The main candidates in Eastleigh are: Labour - Ms Marilyn Birks, a
further-education lecturer; Liberal Democrat - Mr David Chidgey, a civil
engineer; Conservative - Mr Stephen Reid, a data processing manager and
leader of Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council.
Mr Bryan Gould, a former shadow cabinet minister, last night officially
resigned as an MP, to return to his native New Zealand to take up an
academic post.
This creates a by-election in Dagenham, in London's East End, which is
likely to be held on June 9.
