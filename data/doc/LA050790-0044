WORLD IN BRIEF; 
AUSTRALIA; 
NEW TRAIN COLLIDES WITH OLD, KILLING 6 
A modern, double-decker passenger train slammed into the back of an 
old-fashioned steam train that apparently stalled going up a steep hill. 
At least six people were reported killed and 90 injured. The crash occurred in 
a remote area about 25 miles north of Sydney. The trains were carrying about 
430 people.
