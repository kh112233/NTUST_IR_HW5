U.S. LISTS CHIMPS AS ENDANGERED SPECIES 
The government has declared wild chimpanzees an endangered species, a move that 
will provide additional federal protection for man's closest relative, 
officials confirmed Friday. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had classified the primate as a "threatened" 
species, but officials said that more protection was needed in view of recent 
studies documenting a drastic decline in the populations of wild chimps in 
Africa. 
The endangered status designation was also extended to the pygmy chimpanzee, 
which, despite its name, is about the same size as the chimpanzee. 
The chimpanzee has disappeared from five of the 25 African countries that 
represent its historic range, and its population has fallen from a high of 
about 2 million to a current estimate of 175,000 because of overhunting and 
loss of habitat to man. 
The pygmy chimpanzee lives only in Zaire, and experts estimate its population 
at 15,000.
