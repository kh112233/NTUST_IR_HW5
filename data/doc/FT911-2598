FT  29 APR 91 / ANC defeat for Winnie Mandela
MRS Winnie Mandela, on trial in South Africa for kidnapping and assault, was
unexpectedly defeated at the weekend in an election to a senior post in the
African National Congress.
The wife of Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC deputy president, lost a secret ballot
for the presidency of the ANC Women's League.
This post carries automatic membership of the ANC's policy-making National
Executive Committee, under the organisation's proposed new constitution.
Mrs Gertrude Shope, a moderate on the ANC national executive, became Women's
League president late on Saturday night when she took 400 votes to the 196
of Mrs Mandela, who represents the organisation's most radical wing.
Despite her defeat, Mrs Mandela seems likely to be elected in July to an
expanded, 120-member ANC national executive.
