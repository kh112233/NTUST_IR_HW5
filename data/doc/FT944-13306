FT  28 OCT 94 / IMF, World Bank reform talks
The US House Banking Committee and its subcommittee on international
institutions said yesterday they would host a meeting of foreign
parliamentarians on reform of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund. The parliamentarians invited on November 21 will be those who oversee
the international institutions in their own legislatures. Acceptances have
been received so far from Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Argentina,
Costa Rica, Venezuela, Canada and Australia.
Mr Michael Bruno, World Bank chief economist, and Mr Jeffrey Sachs, Harvard
economics professor, will be on an expert panel discussing efforts to open
the IMF and World Bank to public scrutiny. The meeting will also consider
their effectiveness, particularly in alleviating poverty, and the
relationship between development aid and international labour and
environmental standards. The reform effort has been led in the US by
Congressman Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, who has pushed through
legislation requiring US executive directors to make a country's observation
of international labour standards a lending condition.
