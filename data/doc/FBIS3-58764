  [Text] Bayonne, France, Jan 21 (AFP) -- France has 
extradited a suspected ETA Basque separatist to Spain, where he 
is wanted for allegedly participating in five terrorist attacks 
which killed 12 people, a judicial official said here Friday [21 
January]. 
  Felix Ramon Gil Ostaoga, alias Zaldi, is the first suspected 
ETA separatist extradited by France this year and the 25th since 
1984, the official said. 
  Originally from Legazpi in Spain's Guipuzcoa Province, 
Ostaoga, 35, has been living in France since 1983. 
  He was detained by French police on October 24, 1989 in 
Ciboure, southwestern France. Spanish authorities have since 
made several extradition requests for him. 
  Spain has charged Ostaoga with participating in five 
terrorist attacks in 1978 and 1979, as part of the Urola 
commando which is active in Guipuzcoa province. Ten civil 
guardsmen, one policeman and the mayor of Olaberria were killed 
and four other people were seriously wounded in these attacks. 
  Ostoaga arrived in Madrid late Thursday afternoon on a 
regular Air France flight and was immediately handed over to the 
Audencia Nacional anti-terrorist authorities, a Spanish judicial 
official said.
