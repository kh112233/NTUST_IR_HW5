The local agency shall inspect for defective paint surfaces in all units constructed before 1978 that are occupied
by children less than six years of age and are proposed for rehabilitation assistance. ***

Chewable surfaces. 

The local agency shall be required to test the lead content of chewable surfaces if a child under six years of age with
an identified EBL condition is part of the family residing in a unit that was constructed before 1978 and receives rehabilitation
assistance. Lead content shall be tested by using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis
of paint samples. Test readings of 1 mg/cm2 or higher shall be considered positive for presence of lead-based paint.
If the laboratory reports the results in percent by weight, the standard shall be 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million
(ppm). 
(iii) 

Abatement without testing. 

In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, in the case of a residential structure
