FT  19 MAR 93 / Prague to seize shares in assets row
THE Czech government is preparing to seize shares held in privatised Czech
companies by Slovak investors following a bitter dispute between Prague and
Bratislava over the allocation of assets from the former Czechoslovakia.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, said the transfer of shares to
Slovaks from last year's voucher privatisation will be withheld as a
guarantee against Czech claims for compensation from Slovakia.
'The shares of Slovak shareholders are being held by the government as
security before signing agreements on property and on balancing the assets
and liabilities of the (former) Czechoslovak State Bank,' he said. Shares
with a nominal value of around Dollars 10bn (Pounds 7bn) were to be
transferred to investors starting on March 29.
The move brought an angry reaction. Mr Julius Toth, the Slovak finance
minister, doubted the move was legal. The prime minister, Mr Vladimir
Meciar, said it was 'discrimination' against Slovak citizens.
Slovak investors are estimated to have bought shares worth about CzK24bn
(Dollars 830m) in Czech companies, roughly equal to what the Czechs claim
they are owed by Slovakia. Until now, Bratislava has offered to pay CzK1bn
in compensation. Czech citizens invested CzK7.5bn in Slovak companies. Mr
Roman Ceska, the Czech deputy minister of privatisation, said Slovak
investors will be compensated based on the cost of participation in the
voucher privatisation. 'Compensation will be based on the cost of
participation (in the voucher privatisation), that's CzK1,035 (per
investor), but not on the nominal value of shares,' he said.
The announcement dismayed Czech investors in voucher shares. Delays in
transferring shares to Czech owners are inevitable, as it will be necessary
to sift through all transactions to identify Slovak investors.
'It will create big problems in clearing and registering the shares,' said
one investment fund analyst.
