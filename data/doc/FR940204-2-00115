<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The invention listed below is owned by an agency of the U.S. Government and is available for licensing in the U.S. in
accordance with 35 U.S.C. 207 to achieve expeditious commercialization of results of federally funded research
and development.



U.S. Patent Application Number 08/118, 466, filed September 7, 1993, and entitled ``Method for Ultrasonic Imaging
and Device for Performing the Method''_The present invention relates in general to ultrasonic imaging of internal
structures and flaws in materials, and specifically to a new method for coupling an ultrasonic transducer to a test
specimen with irregular or complex surface geometry and a new device for performing the method.

The present invention is a method for ultrasonic imaging of interior structures and flaws in a test specimen with smooth
or irregular contact surfaces, in which an ultrasonic transducer is coupled acoustically to the contact surface
via a plurality of ultrasonic wave guides with equal delay times. The wave guides are thin and bendable, so they adapt
to variations in the distance between the transducer and different parts of the contact surface by bending more or
less. All parts of the irregular contact surface accordingly receive sound waves that are in phase, even when the contact
surface is irregular, so a coherent sound wave is infused in the test specimen. The wave guides can be arranged in the
form of an ultrasonic brush, with a flat head for coupling to a flat transducer, and free bristles that can be pressed
against the test specimen. By bevelling the bristle ends at a suitable angle, shear mode waves can be infused into the
test specimen from a longitudinal mode transducer.

The invention claimed in this patent application is available for licensing on an exclusive, partially exclusive
or nonexclusive basis for upfront, running and annual minimum royalty payments to a partner committed to commercializing
this technology.
