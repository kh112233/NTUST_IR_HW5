 Notice; extension of comment period.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is extending to May 31, 1994, the comment period on a notice that appeared in
the in the 

Federal Register

 of March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12949). The document announced the availability of a draft guidance document entitled ``Fish
and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide.'' In response to several requests, FDA is publishing a document
elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

 to extend the comment period on the proposal to adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing of fish
and fishery products, including procedures for the monitoring of selected process in accordance with Hazard Analysis
Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles (59 FR 4142, January 28, 1994). Because the Fish and Fishery Products Hazards
and Control Guide was developed to serve as an adjunct to the proposal, the agency believes that it would be appropriate
also to extend the comment period on it.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of March 18, 1994 (59 FR 12949), FDA issued a notice of availability for a draft guidance document, the ``Fish and Fishery
Products Hazards and Controls Guide'' (hereafter referred to as the Guide). FDA has prepared this document as an adjunct
to proposed regulations on the safe processing and importing of fish and fishery products. 


The proposed regulations include procedures for the monitoring of selected processes in accordance with Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control that can be used
by food processors and importers. 
The agency anticipates that the Guide will help members of the seafood industry identify and control hazards associated
with the fish and fishery products they process and import. The Guide consists largely of an inventory of known likely
hazards and descriptions of control measures that can be taken to minimize or prevent the occurrence of those hazards.
It includes a considerable amount of detail that, to the best of FDA's knowledge, is either new or has never been compiled
in this manner before. For these reasons FDA believes that public comment on the Guide would be extremely useful.
The notice of availability for the Guide stated that comments were due by April 28, 1994. Although many copies of the
Guide had been distributed at public meetings and through other means before the publication of the notice of availability,
FDA is concerned that the time between the publication of that notice and the end of the comment period is not sufficient.

FDA has concluded that it is in the public interest to allow an additional 30 days for comment. FDA considers that this
amount of time should be more than ample for interested persons to complete and submit their comments. 
FDA also believes that the reasons for extending the comment period on the proposed rule apply to the Guide as well.
Elsewhere in this issue of the 

Federal Register

, FDA is extending the comment period on the proposed rule until May 31, 1994, based on several requests for an extension.

Interested persons may, on or before May 31, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding the Guide. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one
copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in the heading of this document. Received comments
may be seen in the office above between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.




Dated: April 1, 1994.
