FT  17 DEC 94 / Forty telecom groups in big cable deal
The future of Flag, a privately funded fibre optic communications cable
linking Europe and the Far East through the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans,
now seems assured.
This week 40 telecoms carriers including AT&amp;T and Sprint of the US and KDD
of Japan signed agreements committing themselves to purchasing capacity on
the cable when it is completed in early 1997. The agreements define the
operating and maintenance responsibilities for the cable.
Flag (Fibreoptic Link Around the Globe) will be, at 17,000 miles, one of the
world's longest communications lines providing 120,000 digital circuits and
serving about 75 per cent of the world's population.
The managing partner in Flag is Nynex, the regional Bell operating company.
Other investors include Dallah Al-Baraka group of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,
Marubeni Corporation of Japan and Telecom-Asia, a joint venture between
Nynex and Charoen Pokphand of Thailand.
Total funding for the project is expected to be Dollars 1.2bn of which about
Dollars 600m has been raised as equity finance.
Flag Limited, the operating company, said it had signed a Dollars 1.2bn
contract with AT&amp;T Submarine Systems and KDD Submarine Cable Systems to
construct the system. Construction is expected to beging in the first
quarter of 1995.
Mr Gabriel Yackanich, Flag chief executive, said this week's agreements
marked the first cable system funded by private investors which will permit
carriers to buy capacity at true market rates.
