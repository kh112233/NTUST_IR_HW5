Leona Helmsley's lawyer, ending an impassioned 8 1/2-hour defense of his rich 
and famous client in Manhattan federal court, implored the jury "to end the 
long, terrible suffering of Mrs. Helmsley" by acquitting her of tax evasion, 
conspiracy and extortion charges. Gerald A. Feffer painted Helmsley, 69, as the 
victim of government witnesses with axes to grind -- many of them former 
employees that the billionaire hotelier had fired. Feffer sought to rebut 
testimony presented on the extortion charge, the most serious leveled in the 
case, which carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.
