Transrapid To Be Made in March"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- The Federal Cabinet will make a decision 
on the construction of the Transrapid magnetic levitation 
vehicle at the end of March this year. This was announced by 
Transportation Minister Matthias Wissmann (Christian Democratic 
Union) in an interview with DIE WELT. Thus, the minister wants 
to present the draft of the law on the magnetic levitation train 
to the Bundestag before the end of this legislative period. 
Both coalition partners support the project, and it is 
considered certain to be adopted. [passage omitted]
