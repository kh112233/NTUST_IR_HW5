U.S. District Judge John G. Penn in Washington signed an agreement that clears 
the way for the first authorized human gene transfer and requires the National 
Institutes of Health to open future decision-making on such experiments to the 
public. The settlement came in a lawsuit filed Jan. 30 by the Foundation on 
Economic Trends and its president, Jeremy Rifkin, that had challenged the first 
planned introduction of a foreign gene into human beings, an experiment to be 
conducted on 10 patients terminally ill with melanoma, a skin cancer. The suit 
had said the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee approved the experiment 
without conducting proper public hearings.
