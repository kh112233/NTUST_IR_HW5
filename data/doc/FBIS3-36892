  [Text] A free trade agreement by the European Union with 
all three Baltic states will come into force on 1 January 1995, 
Baltic News Service reports. 
  According to experts, the decision adopted last Monday by 
the 
Council of Ministers of the European Union in Brussels, grants 
some privileges to Lithuania and Latvia. European markets will 
be open to Lithuanian and Latvian exports, but imports will be 
restricted for several years. Estonia intends to trade with the 
European Union without any restrictions. 
  According to officials at the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, this decision by the European Union will help Lithuania 
to protect some branches of industry that are so far unable to 
compete with the European producers. Observers think that 
Estonia, liberalizing trade with the European Union in a more 
radical way, will not leave behind its neighbors in striving for 
membership in the European Union. 
  Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should sign together [word 
indistinct] agreement with the European Union and later become 
members of this organization.
