SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Section 38(g)(4)(A) of the AECA and section 127.11(a) of the ITAR prohibit the issuance of export licenses or other
approvals to a person, or any party to the export, who has been convicted of violating certain U.S. criminal statutes
enumerated at section 38(g)(1) of the AECA and section 120.27 of the ITAR. The term ``person'' means a natural person
as well as a corporation, business association, partnership, society, trust, or any other entity, organization,
or group, including governmental entities. The term ``party to the export'' means the president, the chief executive
officer, and other senior officers of the license applicant; the freight forwarders or designated exporting agent
of the license applicant; and any consignee or end user of any item to be exported.



The statute permits export/retransfer privileges to be reinstated on a case-by-case basis after consultation with
the Departments of Treasury and Justice, after a thorough review of the circumstances surrounding the conviction
or ineligibility to export, and a finding that appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate any law enforcement concerns
and ensure future compliance.

In accordance with these authorities the following persons had export/retransfer privileges reinstated pursuant
to section 38(g)(4) of the AECA and section 127.11(b) of the ITAR. The reinstatements occurred between December 22,
1987 and April 15, 1993:
