  [Text] Concerning Japan's plutonium policy, a senior 
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] said on 17 March that "Japan should pace down (the use of 
plutonium)." His remark indicates that the government intends 
to review its nuclear fuel recycling project using plutonium in 
consideration of global fear that Japan may arm itself with 
nuclear weapons. 
  Japan's plutonium policy is currently under study by MITI's 
Advisory Committee for Energy [ACE] and Science and Technology 
Agency's Atomic Energy Commission [AEC]. A prevailing view in 
their discussions is that while maintaining basic principles of 
its plutonium policy, the government should "carefully use 
plutonium" taking such measures as burning it at nuclear power 
plants in order not to have excess plutonium. The senior MITI 
official's remark backs this idea. 
  The official said: "International tension has been hightened 
due to the issue concerning DPRK acceptance of nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)." 
On Japan's plutonium policy, he said: "It has no intention of 
producing nuclear weapons. Even so, (other countries) are 
closely watching us because of our capability to produce them." 
In this way, he stressed the need for Japan to give 
consideration to international opinion. He added: "It is not 
good for Japan to store (plutonium) intently. Japan needs to 
make efforts to increase openness of plutonium use so that other 
nations will understand our policy." 
  The government is considering postponing the operations of a 
fuel recycling plant for extracting plutonium from spent fuel. 
Also, the ACE and AEC are expected to reach a conclusion that 
the government should give more importance to reducing the 
amount of plutonium by burning it than to effectively using it 
through reprocessing.
