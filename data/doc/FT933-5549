FT  02 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese selling sends tin
prices to 20-year lows
CHINESE TIN exports were creating havoc in western tin markets, analysts
suggested yesterday, after the metal's price dropped to fresh 20-year lows
on the London Metal Exchange.
At one point the three months delivery tin price touched Dollars 4,660 a
tonne, well below the western world average cost of production, following an
overnight fall to its lowest-ever price in the Far East. At the LME close
last night the price was down Dollars 50 at Dollars 4,677.50 a tonne.
The surge in Chinese exports has almost completely nullified attempts by the
Association of Tin Producing Countries to bring some stability back to the
market by fixing export quotas.
Mr Fidelis Madavo, analyst at the Commodities Research Unit consultancy
group, pointed out that, according to official statistics, China's tin
exports reached 30,200 tonnes last year - equivalent to more than 15 per
cent of western world demand. Exports continued at record levels in the
first half of this year, jumping by 20 per cent from the 1991 level to
15,000 tonnes.
Therefore, despite substantial cuts in output by other tin producing
countries, the market was likely to show only a small supply deficit this
year, he said. Consumers were living from hand to mouth and waiting for
prices to drift even lower because there was so much metal available.
The ATPC estimates that world-wide tin stocks are between 38,000 and 40,000
tonnes or about 11 weeks of consumption.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said: 'The prospects for tin remain decidedly
uninspiring for the near to medium term. Production looks set to fall still
further this year but the still-huge stock overhang and poor demand outlook
will ensure that the fundamental outlook for this market will remain bleak'.
Billiton forecasts that western tin production this year will fall by 5 per
cent from an already-depressed 142,000 tonnes in 1992 to 135,000 tonnes,
while demand will be down by 2 per cent from 178,000 to 174,000 tonnes.
