A Roman Catholic worker was shot to death in an apparent sectarian attack in 
Belfast, and the IRA's political wing said that one of its local offices was 
hit by a rocket. The killing, preceding this week's local elections in Northern 
Ireland, sparked fears of more sectarian shootings between militant Catholics 
and Protestant paramilitary groups. Sinn Fein, political wing of the outlawed 
Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland, 
said no one was hurt by a RPG-7 rocket fired at one of its offices. Police said 
that if confirmed, it would be the first time Protestant militants had used 
rocket launchers.
