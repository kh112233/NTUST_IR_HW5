  [Text] Seoul, March 25 (YONHAP) -- A Taegu man under 
suspicion of having worked for North Korea abroad, was turned 
over to the Seoul prosecution by the Agency for National 
Security Planning (NSP) on Friday. 
  An NSP investigation showed that Yi Pok-hon, age 33, of 
Sinam 
1-tong, Taegu, left the country in 1990 and had joined an 
international criminal ring, "AS," in Southeast Asia as a 
mid-boss. 
  It said that Yi, while working at the "AS," was recruited by 
North Korean agents, an NSP official said. 
  "The mission the North Koreans gave to Yi was to kill 
anti-Pyongyang Koreans abroad and win over South Korean gang 
leaders," he said. 
  Yi is alleged to have visited North Korea six times from 
1992 
through November 1993 to receive instructions and give reports 
on his espionage activities. 
  In one of his activities for North Korea, Yi provided North 
Korea with 100kg of heroin he obtained through the "AS" 
organization in June 1992, which North Korea smuggled to and 
sold at about 30 million U.S. dollars in Europe, the official 
said.
