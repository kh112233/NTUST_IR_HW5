NEWSWIRE: ROSE CASE FIGURE'S SENTENCE CUT 
The man described as Pete Rose's bookmaker earned a major reduction in his 
sentence on drug and tax charges in Cincinnati Friday because he cooperated 
with federal investigators in a probe of Rose's taxes. 
Ronald Peters, 32, was sentenced to two years in jail by U.S. District Judge S. 
Arthur Spiegel on charges that carried a maximum 23-year prison term. 
Peters formally pleaded guilty to cocaine distribution and making a false 
statement on his 1985 tax return by failing to report $80,000 in gambling and 
bookmaking income.
