  [Excerpts] An unfavorable neighborly skirmish between 
Thailand and Cambodia took place late last week when warships of 
the two countries clashed in the Gulf of Thailand. The 
Cambodian warship reportedly encroached on Thai territorial 
waters to seize Thai fishing trawlers. As a result, the 
Cambodian ship was sunk, and the Cambodian crewmen were rescued 
and detained by Thai authorities. A Thai fishing trawler was 
also sunk during the gun battle. This type of small war is in 
fact one of the common problems between countries sharing the 
same border. 
  In any event, such a border brawl, be it on the land or in 
the sea, is not a big problem as long as authorities of the two 
countries can settle the conflict quickly to prevent it from 
further aggravation, which can lead to a bigger war. If the 
governments of the two countries intend to safeguard their 
friendly relations, they can establish direct contacts, even 
through their embassies, so that they will be able to get in 
touch to settle any conflict and prevent animosity between the 
peoples of the two countries. [passage omitted] 
  The solution to the problem is that the Thai Government must 
keep close contacts with neighboring countries and warn Thai 
fishing trawlers to stay away from territorial waters of other 
countries. The solution sounds simple. Meanwhile, the 
government must hold talks with the neighboring countries to 
encourage them to join hands with us in the fishing industry. 
So far, our government's efforts in this regard have not been 
successful. Burma, to cite an example, has decided to terminate 
the fishing cooperation agreement with us and adopt a new policy 
of shooting at all Thai fishing trawlers found violating its 
territorial waters. It is very likely that this sort of problem 
between the two countries will never be solved.
