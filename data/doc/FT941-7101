FT  26 FEB 94 / BR safety attacked over tunnel rail crash
British Rail's safety procedures are strongly criticised in a report
published yesterday on the collision in the Severn rail tunnel which injured
185 passengers.
An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive says that the accident
in December 1991 could have been avoided, even though its precise cause is
uncertain. A regional Sprinter train ran into a London to Cardiff train in
the 4.4-mile tunnel under the Severn estuary.
The report also condemns BR's implementation of its emergency plan.
Mr Robin Seymour, chief inspecting officer of railways who conducted the
inquiry, says that after the 1988 Clapham Junction accident in London, when
35 people were killed, BR committed itself to a policy of total quality
management. 'It is disturbing to find so little evidence of its effects in
practice here,' he says.
He does not suggest managers and staff were negligent. But because the
tunnel had had only two minor accidents in over a century 'the possibility
of an emergency received too little attention amidst other pressing
priorities'.
He says the accident was caused either by 'an unaccountable error' by the
Sprinter driver, or by the signalling and telecommunications technicians in
the tunnel junction relay room.
BR said yesterday it accepted the findings and was overhauling the tunnel's
safety.
