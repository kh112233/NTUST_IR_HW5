FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Major climbs on Falklands soapbox
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday brought the 'Falklands factor' into his election
campaign, seizing on reports that Mr Neil Kinnock might be prepared to begin
negotiations about the islands' future. Tomorrow it is 10 years since the
Argentines invaded the Falklands.
In Chester, standing on his now-indispensable soapbox, Mr Major said: 'What
do we hear from the Labour leader as we come up to the anniversary of the
Falklands war? He wants to enter into discussions about what the future of
the Falklands should be.
'I wonder what message that gives to the soldiers, airmen and navymen who
actually fought in that war and to the people still living there.'
Mr Kinnock had indicated Labour might be ready to negotiate with a stable
Argentine democracy about the Falklands, provided that there were
enforceable guarantees about the islands' security.
He said: 'There cannot be anything done without the active consent of the
people of the Falkland Islands. Too much has been expended, the loyalty is
too great and the status is too important for there to be any abandonment of
the needs and desires of the people of the Falklands.'
Mr Major also highlighted the contrast between his campaigning and the more
'closely minded' style of Mr Kinnock. He told a lone heckler in the crowd of
a few hundred: 'It's nice to see one member of the Labour party who doesn't
live in a field train, secreted from the rest of the world.
'Wherever I go between now and April 9 this soapbox is coming with me. There
is no way they are going to stop the Conservative message getting right out
on the streets.'
