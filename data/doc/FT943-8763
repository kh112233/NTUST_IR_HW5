FT  16 AUG 94 / Russians fire on Japan boats
The Russian coastguard yesterday fired on two Japanese fishing boats in
waters off the disputed South Kurile islands, wounding one crew-member,
Russian officials said yesterday. The clash was the first time Russia, which
has often accused Japanese vessels of poaching in Russian waters, has fired
on a Japanese ship and could provoke a serious escalation in the dispute
between the two nations over the contested Kurile islands. Japan is trying
to reclaim the islands, seized by Soviet soldiers at the end of the second
world war and has refused to commit serious government or private funds to
Russia because of the dispute. Yesterday's incident, which Russian
coastguard officials described as 'necessary', suggests Moscow intends to
take a tougher line in enforcing its sovereignty. One Japanese boat is now
in Russian custody and the coastguard is searching for the second.
