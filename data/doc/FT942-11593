FT  05 MAY 94 / Customs official tells Scott of errors
The investigation which led to the unsuccessful trial of three directors of
Matrix Churchill, the Midlands machine tool manufacturers, should have been
carried out more thoroughly, a senior Customs and Excise official admitted
yesterday to the Scott inquiry.
Mr Douglas Tweddle, head of investigations at Customs, conceded that with
hindsight his staff should have inquired further into the roles played by
individual government departments involved in the affair.
Mr Tweddle is one of a small number of witnesses called to give evidence to
the inquiry after its official closure date last month.
Lord Justice Scott had asked him why Customs investigators only questioned
civil servants from the Department of Trade and Industry about the licence
applications for the export to Iraq of equipment capable of being used to
manufacture munitions.
Mr Tweddle said Customs had relied entirely on the DTI because, as the
licensing authority, it was thought it would reflect the views of other
departments involved such as the Foreign Office and Ministry of Defence.
However, after the judge pointed out that documents released during the
trial demonstrated the different views of the various ministries towards the
applications, Mr Tweddle agreed officials from these departments should also
have been questioned.
But he denied a suggestion by Lord Justice Scott that such questioning would
have demonstrated that the intelligence services knew for certain that the
equipment was destined for military use and was therefore against government
policy.
Such intelligence information could raise suspicions but not prove anything
with certainty, Mr Tweddle said.
He defended the decision to mount the prosecution, insisting that the case
turned on what the three Matrix Churchill directors had stated to the DTI
about the end use of the equipment they wanted to export.
