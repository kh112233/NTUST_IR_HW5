FT  15 FEB 92 / Somali groups agree to end bitter civil war
The two sides in Somalia's civil war yesterday signed separate commitments
to an immediate cessation of hostilities, with a formal ceasefire to be
completed by early March, the leader of one of the rival delegations said,
Reuter reports from the United Nations.
The agreement came after three days of UN-sponsored peace talks in New York
co-ordinated by Undersecretary-General James Jonah. Up to 30,000 people have
been killed or wounded in three months of fighting in the Somali capital,
Mogadishu, in which supporters of General Mohamed Farrah Aidid, of the
United Somali Congress (USC), have been battling to oust interim President
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, also of the USC.
Earlier yesterday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
called for a massive and urgent world effort to save 4m-5m people in Somalia
from mass starvation.
