FT  23 JAN 93 / Letter: Maternity leave that makes sense
Sir, The National Audit Office report published this week (Errors found in
sick-pay scheme, January 20) showed the problems employers are having with a
complicated scheme. Almost one in three of the cases of statutory maternity
pay examined was inaccurate.
Unfortunately, it is going to get more complicated. The Trade Union Reform
and Employment Rights Bill introduces 14 weeks maternity leave for all
women.
Add this to the existing right to return to work up to 29 weeks after
childbirth, 18 weeks pay, six weeks at 90 per cent of income for women
fulfilling the service requirement and 18 weeks at a flat rate for the rest,
and you can begin to see how excessively complex it is likely to become.
A far better fit with existing provision would be achieved by granting all
women 18, not 14, weeks leave. Before you shout 'It'll cost too much', just
think about it.
There would be no additional recruitment or training costs if you already
have a temporary replacement. Women will be returning when they and their
babies are fitter. Contractual rights would be extended for the additional
four weeks, but good employers are doing this anyway.
The Maternity Alliance will be working hard as the Bill goes through
parliament to convince employers and the organisations representing them
that 18 weeks maternity leave makes sense for mothers, babies and employers.
