FOR 30 YEARS ON DEATH ROW, $1 MILLION 
A Japanese man who spent 30 years on death row after being wrongly convicted of 
murdering a 6-year-old girl was awarded nearly $1 million in compensation 
Tuesday. 
A district court at Shizuoka awarded Masao Akahori, 59, more than $75 for each 
of his 12,668 days in custody, press reports said. 
"Speaking frankly, I bear a deep grudge and hatred," he said. 
Akahori was arrested in 1954 and apparently forced to confess to the murder 
after three days of police questioning, but it was not until 1958 that he was 
sentenced to death.
