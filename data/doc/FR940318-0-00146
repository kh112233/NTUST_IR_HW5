CFC12 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. 


(a) 

HFC134a. 


HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. 
HFC134a does not contribute to ozone depletion. HFC134a's GWP and atmospheric 
lifetime are close to those of other alternatives which are acceptable in this end-use. While 
HFC134a is compatible with most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment parts, 
it is not compatible with the mineral oils currently used in such systems. An ester-based 
lubricant should be used rather than mineral oils. 
(3) 

CFC113 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit.

 
No substitutes have been identified for CFC113 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. 
(4) 

CFC114 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. 


(a) 

HCFC124. 


HCFC124 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC114 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. 
Because HCFC124 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative. 
However, it represents a much lower ozone-depleting risk than the continued use of CFCs. In 
addition, HCFC124's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than other 
alternatives. HCFC124 is not flammable. 
(5) 

R500 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit. 


(a) 

HFC134a. 


HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for R500 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers. 
See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 centrifugal chillers. 
(6) 

CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500 
Centrifugal Chillers, New. 


(a) 

HCFC123. 


HCFC123 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and 
R500 in new centrifugal chillers. See the discussion on HCFC123 under retrofitted CFC11 
centrifugal chillers. 
(b) 

HCFC124. 


HCFC124 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC114 in new centrifugal chillers. See 
the discussion on HCFC124 under retrofitted CFC114 centrifugal chillers. 
(c) 

HCFC22. 


HCFC22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and 
R500 in new centrifugal chillers. HCFC22 has been used in a variety of air conditioning 
and refrigeration applications for many years. Like HCFC123, HCFC22 contributes to 
ozone depletion and is considered a transitional alternative. HCFC22 exhibits a higher ODP 
than HCFC123, and production of it will be phased out according to the accelerated phase 
out schedule. HCFC22's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are higher than other HCFCs. 
HCFC22 is not flammable and is it compatible with existing oils used in most refrigeration 
and air conditioning equipment. 
(d) 

HFC134a. 


HFC134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and 
R500 in new centrifugal chillers. See the discussion on HFC134a under retrofitted CFC12 
centrifugal chillers. 
(e) 

HFC227ea. 


HFC227ea is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and 
R500 in new centrifugal chillers. HFC227ea is a new chemical that has not seen 
widespread use. It contains no chlorine, so it does not contribute to ozone depletion. 
HFC227ea's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are higher than those of other alternatives which 
are acceptable in this end-use. HFC227ea is also being investigated as a component of 
several blends. 
(f) 

Ammonia. 


Ammonia is acceptable as a substitute for CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and 
R500 in new centrifugal chillers. Ammonia does not deplete the ozone or contribute to 
global warming. Ammonia is flammable and toxic, but it may be used safely if existing 
OSHA and ASHRAE standards are followed. Users should check local building codes related 
to the use of ammonia. 
(g) 

Evaporative cooling. 


Evaporative Cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal chillers 
using CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, or R500. Evaporative cooling does not 
contribute to ozone depletion or global warming and has the potential to be more energy 
efficient than current refrigeration and air conditioning systems. Evaporative cooling uses no 
chemicals, but relies instead on water evaporation as a means of cooling. It is in widespread 
use in office buildings in the western U.S. Recent design improvements have greatly 
expanded its applicability to other regions. 
(h) 

Desiccant cooling. 


Desiccant cooling is acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal chillers 
using CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, or R500. Desiccant cooling systems do not

contribute to ozone depletion or global warming. They offer potential energy savings over 
the use of CFC11. Desiccant cooling is an alternate technology to the vapor compression 
cycle. 
(i) 

Ammonia/water absorption. 


Ammonia/water absorption is acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal 
chillers using CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, or R500. Ammonia/water absorption
is 
an alternative technology to vapor compression cycles. Ammonia is the refrigerant, and water 
is the absorber. This alternative has zero ODP and GWP. For information on toxicity, see 
the discussion of ammonia above. Users should check local building codes related to the use 
of ammonia. 
(j) 

Water/lithium bromide absorption. 


Water/lithium bromide absorption is acceptable as an alternative technology to 
centrifugal chillers using CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, or R500. Some absorption

systems use water as the refrigerant and lithium bromide as the absorber. Lithium bromide 
has zero ODP and GWP. It is low in toxicity and is nonflammable. 
(k) 

Stirling cycle. 


Stirling Cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to centrifugal 
chillers using CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, or R500. These systems use a different

thermodynamic cycle from vapor compression equipment. Helium is frequently used as the 
refrigerant. The Stirling cycle does not include a phase change. Heat transfer is 
accomplished through compression and expansion. These systems have been used for several 
decades, primarily in refrigerated transport and cryogenics.

HFC227ea is acceptable as a substitute for CFC12 in new reciprocating chillers. See 
the discussion on HFC227ea under new CFC11, CFC12, CFC113, CFC114, and R500

centrifugal chillers.
