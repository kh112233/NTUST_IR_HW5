 

(i) Complies with the safety requirements specified in 10 CFR 32.72(a)(3), (a)(4), and (c); 

(ii) Is operated by a medical use licensee; and 

(iii) Only engages in limited distribution to a specified set of medical use licensees but does not engage in commercial
distribution. 

Other Part 33 or 35 medical use licensees seeking this authority must first apply for a license amendment and receive
an authorization for limited distribution pursuant to Part 32. The fees specified in Category 3C of 10 CFR 170.31 and
10 CFR 171.16 are assessed for this type of authorization. As provided in footnote 1(d)(2) of 10 CFR 170.31, there is
an application fee (fee Category 3C) to add this type of authorization. Upon issuance of the license amendment adding
this authorization, the licensee will be subject to the licensing and inspection fees in fee Category 3C of 10 CFR 170.31
and the annual fees in fee Category 3C of 10 CFR 171.16. These fees are in addition to any other fee categories covered
by the existing license. 

However, in those cases where a small number of Part 35 licensees wish to transfer unsealed byproduct material among
themselves, the NRC will consider granting an exemption pursuant to 10 CFR 35.19. 10 CFR 170.31 (footnote 2) specifies
the fees for such exemption requests. For existing Part 35 licensees, requests for an exemption under 10 CFR 35.19
are subject to the amendment fees specified in 10 CFR 170.31, or fee Category 7B or 7C, as applicable.

Comment. 

The NRC should continue to permit Part 33 licensees who are authorized to produce radioactive drugs to be used only
for research experiments to distribute these drugs to medical use licensees. 



Response. 

The Commission currently permits such a Part 33 licensee to distribute, on a limited basis, radioactive drugs to be
used only for research experiments through a license amendment approval on a case-by-case basis. The Commission
believes that Part 33 licensees who have been granted this authority could continue to distribute these drugs provided
that the Part 33 licensee complies with safety requirements specified in 10 CFR 32.72(a)(3), (a)(4), and (c). Other
Part 33 licensees seeking this authority must first apply for a license amendment and receive an authorization for
limited distribution pursuant to Part 32. This type of authorization is subject to the fees specified in fee Category
3C of 10 CFR 170.31 and 171.16. As provided in footnote 1(d)(2) of 10 CFR 170.31, there is an application fee (fee Category
3C) to add this type of authorization. Upon issuance of the license amendment adding this authorization, the licensee
will be assessed the licensing and inspection fees in fee Category 3C of 10 CFR 170.31 and the annual fees in fee Category
3C of 10 CFR 171.16. These fees are in addition to any other fee categories covered by the existing license. 



Section 32.72(a)(4). 



There were numerous comments addressing the labeling requirements. These comments and NRC's responses are summarized
below. 

(1) 

Comment. 

Several commenters stated that the NRC has no legal jurisdiction over drug labeling and should not require drug labeling
because it is regulated by the FDA. Another commenter supported the proposed labeling requirements and stated that
its facility has already included all information specified in the proposed rule. 



Response. 

The Commission has broad authority under sections 81 and 161 of the Atomic Energy Act, as amended, including authority
to establish by rule, regulation, or order, such standards and instructions to govern the possession and use of byproduct
material. Therefore, the Commission has jurisdiction to require labeling of radioactive drugs containing byproduct
material and is currently requiring that specific information be included on labels. 

The Commission's labeling requirements are not intended to duplicate FDA requirements, but are intended to provide
information related to radiation safety. These labels are needed for: 

(i) Hospital workers to ensure that the radioactive drug is the correct drug and the correct dosage; and 

(ii) Transport workers to identify the contents of a vial, container, or package, and to take appropriate actions
in the event of any transportation accident. 

(2) 

Comment. 

It would be very costly to have inspectors check 12 million drug labels. The commenter believes that this activity
would be entirely cost-ineffective. 



Response. 

The modifications to current 32.72(a)(4) are intended to clarify the existing labeling requirements, except
for the addition of ``time of assay.'' Thus, the Commission believes that licensees will not incur significant additional
cost associated with these modifications. In terms of inspections, the NRC inspectors do not check the label of every
container or package of a radioactive drug. They may conduct spot checks. Thus, there will not be a significant cost
for NRC inspectors either.
