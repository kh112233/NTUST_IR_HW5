FT  07 FEB 92 / Argentine prices increase by 3% in January
ARGENTINA'S ambitious anti-inflation strategy has received a body blow with
the announcement of a 3 per cent increase in prices in January. The policies
of Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister and architect of Argentina's
economic revival, hinge on lowering inflation to international levels.
Mr Cavallo forecast inflation of 6-7 per cent this year, but January's
surprisingly heavy increase makes that target almost unattainable.
Although January's inflation is low by Argentina's standards, it came as a
bitter disappointment after monthly inflation sank to a 20-year low of 0.4
per cent in November, rising slightly to 0.6 per cent in December.
January's increase brings the 12-month inflation rate to 76 per cent.
Mr Cavallo must hold price increases down to 0.35 per cent a month for the
rest of the year to meet his inflation target and avoid placing insuperable
strains on the fixed exchange rate, the weakest link in his strategy.
Argentina's peso is now pegged to the US dollar after floating at the outset
of free convertibility last April.
Since April inflation has risen by 25 per cent while the peso has lost only
2 per cent of its value, making the currency increasingly overvalued.
Nonetheless, export competitiveness has been maintained by reducing internal
taxes.
Officials emphasised that January's increase was due to seasonal factors.
They stressed that fiscal and monetary policies were fully on target and
warned against a return to indexing wages and prices to the inflation rate,
a move that would be guaranteed to re-ignite steep inflation.
Earlier, Mr Cavallo had warned that heavy, sustained inflation would
automatically lead to a recession.
Last year the economy grew an estimated 5 per cent while the government
projects 6 per cent growth in real terms this year.
