FT  15 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trinidad to gain Dollars 60m
iron carbide plant
A US company is building a Dollars 60m plant in Trinidad to produce iron
carbide from iron ore imported from Brazil.
The Nucor Corporation of North Carolina says the plant will produce 320,000
tonnes of iron carbide per year, and that the material will be exported to
the US for use in the company's steel mills.
Construction of the plant will begin in the first quarter of this year, with
production scheduled to start in the last quarter of next year. Nucor says
the Trinidad plant will be the first to use the company's patented process
to convert iron ore into iron carbide using natural gas.
The iron carbide plant will be fired by locally produced natural gas, and
will be located at the Point Lisas industrial complex in south central
Trinidad.
