FT  13 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: FDA hits drug blue chip
FUND managers specialising in the health and household sector, already
reeling this week from two doses of bad news affecting Glaxo, the drug
market's former glamour stock, were given another thorough shaking as
SmithKline Beecham (SB) shares fell sharply on bad news from the US.
The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) advisory committee rejected
approval of SB's Kytril, formulated as an anti-nausea drug, citing concerns
about side-effects.
Pharmaceuticals specialists described the rejection of approval for Kytrin
as a 'big disappointment', and said that the move was a 'significant knock
to confidence in the stock'. He said Kytrin is one of a handful of 'key new
drugs' for SB. He also pointed out that the FDA move was seen by the market
as a delay rather than total rejection. Another bear point for SB shares was
an article in the British Medical Journal which highlighted a review of
anti-depressant drugs, favouring existing preparations over newer drugs,
including SB's Paxil.
SB shares, heavily supported over the week as big international funds
switched out of Glaxo and into SB, tumbled to 466p before steadying and
closing a net 21 1/2 off at 469 1/2 p. Turnover in the ordinaries totalled a
hefty 6.2m shares.
The overall market decline and yet more selling pressure from the US put
paid to any hopes of a revival in Glaxo shares, which dipped to 656p before
stabilising and settling a net 3 off at 665p.
