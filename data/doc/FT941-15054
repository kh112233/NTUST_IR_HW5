FT  18 JAN 94 / PM's decision on dam project
Mr John Major took the final decision to sign an aid deal with the Malaysian
government which a top Whitehall mandarin described yesterday as an 'abuse'
of taxpayers' money. The programme, to build a hydroelectric dam on
Malaysia's Pergau river, has cost the UK government more than Pounds 300m
and is the largest expenditure ever incurred on a single project by the
Overseas Development Agency.
