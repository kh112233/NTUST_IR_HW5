  [Text] Baku, January 18 (TURAN)--According to the sources 
close to Defense Ministry of Azerbaijan, Armenian Defense 
Ministry ordered its Armed Forces located in Karabakh to use war 
gas against Azeri Army. 
  Armenia has already sent necessary chemical war gas to 
Dzhebrailskiy and Beylagan regions (southern part of front). 
Late December 1993 a specially trained group arrived from 
Armenia to Karabakh to get the chemical weapons ready for 
application. 
  On December 30 Armenian forces have already put chemical gas 
war into practice in the place of Gural-tepe of Beylagan region 
of Azerbaijan. As a result of examination of ground and shell- 
splinters, chemical laboratory under Civil Defense of Republic 
found chemical war gas "cyanide". 
  Military experts think that it is prohibited to apply this 
type of chemical gas war in military activities as they are 
weapons of mass annihilation.
