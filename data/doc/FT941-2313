FT  22 MAR 94 / Militants shot dead in Egypt
Egyptian security forces yesterday shot dead six suspected Islamic militants
in a dawn raid near the southern Egyptian town of Abu Tig, the Interior
Ministry said, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo.
The shooting followed a security sweep by more than 150 security officers in
search of gunmen who killed five police officers on Sunday in the same area.
One policeman died in yesterday's raid.
The incidents are the bloodiest this year in the continuing cycle of
violence between security forces and Islamic militants around the Upper
Egyptian town of Assiut.
