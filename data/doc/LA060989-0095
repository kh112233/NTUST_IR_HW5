BRIEFLY 
Airlines Fined: The Federal Aviation Administration announced $1.25 million in 
fines against 28 U.S. airlines for failing to detect mock weapons at airports. 
On the brighter side, the agency said the airlines were detecting 93% of 
weapons in tests, an improvement from almost 89% last fall and the best showing 
ever.
