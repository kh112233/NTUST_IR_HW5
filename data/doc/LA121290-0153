AT&amp;T AND MCI SETTLE THEFT, FALSE AD SUITS; 
COMMUNICATIONS: THE TWO FIRMS ARE LOCKED IN A WAR FOR CUSTOMERS. THEY WANT THE 
FCC TO SET UP GUIDELINES ON SWITCHING PHONE USERS. 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp. said today 
they had reached an out-of-court settlement on lawsuits and countersuits that 
had alleged theft of customers and false advertising. 
Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. 
As part of the agreement, the two companies agreed to propose adoption by the 
Federal Communications Commission of industrywide standards to protect 
consumers from being switched to other long-distance companies against their 
will. 
The proposed standards would permit long-distance carriers to switch a 
customer's service only by one of the following means: 
* A customer-initiated call to an 800 number of the carrier to which the 
customer is switching. 
* Independent third-party confirmation. 
* Signed letter of authorization. 
* A call placed by the customer to their local or long-distance telephone 
company. 
The two companies, along with US Sprint, have been locked in a fierce battle 
for customers. AT&amp;T and MCI, or their agents, have been placing calls to 
millions of phone users each month trying to get them to switch their 
long-distance service. 
State and federal authorities and local phone companies have received tens of 
thousands of complaints about unauthorized switching. 
Since the breakup of the old Bell System in 1984, AT&amp;T's share of the 
long-distance market has eroded to below 70%. MCI, the nation's second-largest 
long-distance carrier, now has about 15% of the market. 
AT&amp;T, which had claimed that it was losing customers because of 
unauthorized switching by MCI and its telemarketing agent, had asked the FCC to 
require a customer's written authorization before a change could be made.
