POLICE SEARCH AREA OF STABBINGS 
San Diego Police conducted an extensive air and ground search Sunday in the 
area where two University City women were slain late last week. 
From 6 a.m. until almost 3 p.m., homicide units, in addition to canine, horse, 
helicopter and foot patrols -- a total of 35 officers -- searched canyon areas 
near the murder scene in the 5800 block of Honors Drive. 
Thursday, Pamela Gail Glark, 42, and Amber Michelle Clark, her 18-year-old 
daughter, were found stabbed to death inside the family's residence. The elder 
Clark worked as an assistant to her husband, Joseph Lazzaro, a Mission Hills 
acupuncturist. 
The younger Clark was a student at Mesa College and a recent graduate of 
University City High School, where police set up a command post Sunday 
afternoon. 
Investigators believe the latest slayings may be related to three previous 
stabbing deaths in Clairemont, all involving young women. 
In the stabbing death of Holly Suzanne Tarr on April 3, a suspect was seen 
running from the scene.
