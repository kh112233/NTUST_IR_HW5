NATION IN BRIEF; 
NEW YORK; 
STRICTEST VDT SAFETY BILL IN U.S. PASSED 
The New York City Council has approved legislation to protect the health and 
safety of more than 12,000 city workers who use video display terminals. The 
bill is the toughest VDT law in the nation and the first law of its kind in a 
major city, according to the New York City Video Display Terminal Coalition of 
labor unions and occupational safety and health groups. The bill mandates that 
VDT operators at city agencies be given a 15-minute break when they are 
required to work at a terminal for more than two consecutive hours. Under the 
law, VDT workers with certain medical conditions -- including pregnancy -- 
would be allowed to obtain transfers.
