A federal judge agreed to postpone for nearly a month the start of a trial on 
drug and tax charges for Thomas Gioiosa, 31, a former housemate of Cincinnati 
Reds Manager Pete Rose. 
U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel issued the order to give Gioiosa's new 
lawyers time to prepare for trial, said Marianne Kuhn, an aide in Spiegel's 
chambers. Gioiosa's trial was to have started Friday, but now is postponed 
until Aug. 24 in Spiegel's Cincinnati courtroom.
