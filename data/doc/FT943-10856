FT  03 AUG 94 / New Israel-Jordan crossing
Israeli and Jordanian officials met yesterday to finalise plans for a new
border crossing between the Red Sea towns of Eilat and Aqaba, which will
boost regional tourism and pave the way to new commercial and trade
relations, Julian Ozanne reports from Jerusalem.
The crossing is expected to be opened next week by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli
prime minister, King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, who will be in the region to spur Israeli-Syrian peace
talks.
Israeli officials said the two sides were trying to finalise customs,
traffic, immigration and border formalities for third-country tourists
travelling between Israel and Jordan. Israel was also making a makeshift
road along the northern shores of the Gulf of Aqaba where the border
terminal will be built in place of coils of razor wire, sandbags and
military watch towers.
Opening the Aqaba-Eilat border will be the first concrete step to normalise
relations following the Washington declaration signed by King Hussein and Mr
Rabin last month. At present, foreign passport holders may cross into Jordan
via the Allenby Bridge but only with special permits and if their passports
do not have Israeli stamps.
Israeli officials said the first telephone links between the two countries
would be opened 'within days'. Bilateral talks on border demarcation, water,
security and environmental issues will also resume next Sunday on the
Israeli side of the Dead Sea as the two sides work towards a formal peace
treaty.
