FT  27 JAN 93 / Safety on railways shows improvement
RAIL safety continued its long-term improvement last year in spite of some
well-publicised accidents such as the one at London's Cannon Street station,
the Health and Safety Executive said yesterday.
Although the number of fatalities in train crashes rose from four to 11, the
total of so-called significant train accidents - potentially the most
dangerous to passengers - fell from 161 to 131.
Total fatalities, including people hit by moving trains or falling from
them, rose from 84 to 94. In addition, 242 trespassers and suicides died, a
fall from 285 the year before.
Mr Robin Seymour, chief inspecting officer of railways, announced that the
executive was to study driver behaviour in regard to level crossing warning
lights.
