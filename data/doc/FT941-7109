FT  26 FEB 94 / The Malaysian Trade Ban: MPs will press investigation
despite row - Malaysia's ban on state contracts for British companies in
protest at reports of corruption by the UK media has taken John Major's
government by surprise and doubled its embarrassment over the Pergau dam
affair. FT writers explain the background to the conflict and the depth of
the troubles now facing UK companies
UK businessmen and the Malaysian government have been united in complaining
about British press coverage of the Pergau dam affair in recent days.
But despite their protestations, the British media and MPs will continue to
press Mr John Major's government on an issue they regard as having
legitimate public interest.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will next Wednesday be
cross-examined on Britain's aid for the Pergau dam by the House of Commons
Foreign Affairs Committee.
MPs will quiz Mr Hurd on his decision in July 1991 to approve a Pounds 234m
grant to the Malaysian government for the hydro-electric dam - the largest
sum for a single scheme under the Overseas Development Administration's Aid
and Trade Provision - against the advice of the civil servant in charge of
aid policy.
More crucially, they want to find out whether, in their zeal to win defence
contracts with Malaysia, ministers broke foreign office guidelines
prohibiting the linking of aid to arms sales.
The UK grant for the dam had been negotiated at around the same time as a
Pounds 1bn defence package was signed by Lady Thatcher, then prime minister,
and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister.
The package, which includes sales by GEC and British Aerospace, remains
shrouded in secrecy but it is thought to include the supply of fighter
aircraft and the construction of military command and logistics centres.
Mr Hurd said yesterday the aid and defence deals had been briefly
'entangled' for three months in 1988, and were 'then pursued separately.'
GEC also said yesterday there was no linkage between the defence deal and
Pergau, even though it has a share of both contracts.
Questions about the deal were first raised last October when the National
Audit Office, the government's accountancy watchdog, issued a report on the
project. It revealed that ODA officials had concluded that on commercial
terms, the Pergau project was 'a very bad buy' and a burden on Malaysian
consumers.
The NAO said that funding arrangements chosen by the government would add at
least Pounds 56m to the aid provided by the UK taxpayer over the 14-year
life of the project. It would also mean Malaysians paying Pounds 100m more
in electricity costs than cheaper alternatives.
Since then, the foreign office has admitted that before Lady Thatcher
concluded the defence deal, her then defence secretary Lord Younger signed a
protocol in March 1988 which - in the foreign office's words - 'briefly
linked arms and aid.' It is understood that in the protocol aid was offered
as a specific percentage of the defence deal.
Downing Street officials said last week this was an 'unfortunate error' by
officials advising Lord Younger. Mr Hurd has repeatedly claimed that the
deals were 'delinked' within three months, and that Malaysia was informed
that there could be no formal package encompassing the two.
Nevertheless members of the FAC want to ask Mr Hurd several questions next
week:
Is it credible to say that the deals were 'delinked' just because they were
not formally pursued in a single package?
Why did Mr John Major, as prime minister, give the final go-ahead for
cheques for the project to be signed in February 1991?
Is there any connection between the securing of the defence deal and the
issue of public interest immunity certificates preventing the release of
foreign office telexes in the trial of Mr Lorrain Osman, a Malaysian
businessman?
Members of the FAC have asked to see the full text of a letter sent to Dr
Mahathir on August 8 1988 by Baroness Thatcher. She confirmed the aid deal,
but foreign office officials say that at the end of the letter she 'looked
forward to Dr Mahathir's visit to Britain in September 1988, when she hoped
that the memorandum of understanding on the defence package could be
signed.'
It is also understood that Baroness Thatcher sent memoranda to Lord Younger
and other ministers in the spring of 1988 raising deep concern over the
linkage of the deals. How much light do these throw on the decisions that
were finally taken?
The overriding political issue will be the extent to which foreign policy
factors as well as wider commercial considerations overrode aid policy, and
where in the final analysis the UK national interest lay.
The Malaysian government has argued that it was an important project as part
of their programme to diversify their sources of electric power. BICC and
Trafalgar House, the lead contractors on Pergau, also argue that the project
will prove economically viable in the longer term.
Mr Hurd's defence is that the deal was crucial in getting a more favourable
trading relationship for the UK and Malaysia. He has also argued that he had
no choice but to stand by commitments made by previous ministers in Baroness
Thatcher's government.
