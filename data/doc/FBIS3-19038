<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Asylum Law Stems Tide of </F>
Applicants"] 
  [Text] Bonn -- The asylum law that came into force on 1 
July last year has caused a clear fall in the number of 
asylum-seekers. According to an Interior Ministry report, there 
were 98,500 applicants for asylum in the second half of 1993, 
against 224,099 in the first half of that year. However, the 
report says it is too soon to provide a definite assessment of 
the new law. 
  According to the report, there was a marked fall in the 
number of asylum-seekers from Romania and Bulgaria; between July 
and December 1993 the numbers were 9,898 and 2,438 respectively. 
In the first half of 1993, 63,827 Romanians and 20,109 
Bulgarians sought asylum. The fact that an application for 
asylum no longer provides automatic entitlement to a longer stay 
is given as an explanation for the reduced number of 
applications. 
  The total number of known cases of illegal entry has also 
fallen by 45 percent, but the demand for the services of helpers 
has clearly risen. Some 438 cases of illegal entry were 
recorded in the first quarter of 1993, and 509 in the second 
quarter. 
  At the end of 1993, the Federal Office for the Recognition 
of 
Foreign Refugees was dealing with 296,300 applications, 163,965 
less than in the middle of the year. The number of expulsions 
also rose from 10,798 in 1992 to 35,915 in 1993.
