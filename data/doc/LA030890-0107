CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF; 
BAKERSFIELD; 
PESTICIDE DEATH IS CONTINUING PUZZLER 
Authorities said they will probably never know whether a farm worker who died 
of pesticide poisoning Jan. 20 was a victim of murder, an accident or suicide. 
Jose Campos Martinez died after spraying almond trees with the potent pesticide 
parathion in the Wasco area. "We found parathion in his stomach but not on his 
skin, not on his clothing and not in his liver, lungs or kidneys," said Jim 
Malouf, chief investigator in the Kern County coroner's office.
