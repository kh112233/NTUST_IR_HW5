COSTS FOR FOOD STAMPS, WELFARE JUMP SHARPLY 
A large jump in the number of people eligible for food stamps and welfare 
benefits this year is costing states and the federal government billions of 
dollars, a published report said Monday. 
At least 44 states have reported increases in enrollment, with some rising 50%, 
said an Agriculture Department report quoted in the New York Times. 
The number of people receiving food stamps rose by 1.3 million from May, 1989, 
to May, 1990, when it topped 20 million for the first time since 1985, said the 
report, which was submitted to Congress. 
The department, which administers the food stamp program, noted that food stamp 
rolls have risen 16% in the last year in Texas, 19% in Florida, 26% in Nevada, 
54% in New Hampshire, 12% each in Georgia and Massachusetts, 7% each in New 
York state and California, and 21% in Connecticut. 
Congress appropriated $14.8 billion, but that proved inadequate and it had to 
provide an additional $1.2 billion in May. It then directed the Agriculture 
Department to investigate the causes. 
The department report said that "44 states and the District of Columbia 
experienced a growth in participation" in the food stamp program over the last 
year, while the nation's unemployment rate was relatively stable.
