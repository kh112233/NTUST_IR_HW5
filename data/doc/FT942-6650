FT  28 MAY 94 / Survey of Residential Property (12): A retirement village on
the British model - Portugal
A new idea for the Algarve is a sheltered retirement village modelled on
retirement homes in Britain - but rarely found elsewhere. This is Monte da
Palhagueira, near Loule, a little inland and surrounded by open country.
The village will comprise 30 one- and two-bedroom single-storey cottages.
But the ground slopes and some buyers might like further accommodation built
below.
The properties, with their pretty glazed-tile decoration and occasional
pepperpot barbecue chimneys, have large sitting rooms with open fireplaces.
There is a dining area off the kitchen and some have internal patios. They
will all have a terrace and parking space, but all will be different.
Three have been built, and one furnished as a show house, by Mary
Cornelius-Reid and her husband, who are responsible for the project. The
village, with its cottages in small groups and walkways threading between
them, will later have a community hall and perhaps a small
interdenominational church.
It is being built in the 22-acre grounds of the Cornelius-Reid's nursing
home. They have three nursing homes in the south of England, two with
similar sheltered housing. The properties will sell for between Pounds
90,000 and Pounds 150,000 through John D Wood &amp; Co (Winchester, tel:
0962-863131).
Buyers have a life lease and if they become frail, they can transfer to the
nursing home and have their money refunded, then paying normal nursing home
fees. Service charges in the cottages will be about Pounds 100 a week. This
includes lunch in the nursing home restaurant, with the option of an evening
meal. It also includes maintenance to the properties, domestic help and
24-hour warden service.
There is a swimming pool in the nursing home gardens, which cottage
residents can use.
