  [Text] A step forward was made in the negotiations with 
Latvia on the state maritime border, Lithuanian Deputy Foreign 
Minister Vladislovas Domarkas told the Baltic News Service 
correspondent after the meeting in Liepaja yesterday. 
  An agreement in principle has been reached with Latvia that 
the state maritime border will proceed as a continuation of the 
state land border while the boundary of the economic zone will 
run parallel to the sea shore. 
  According to Domarkas, such agreement is a result of 
bilateral compromise. The principle concepts of the agreement, 
however, will have to be endorsed by the parliaments of both 
countries. 
  A possibility to set up yet another special zone next to the 
border of the economic zone in which both parties could exploit 
the sea shelf was also discussed in Liepaja by the 
representatives from the Lithuanian and Latvian Ministries of 
Foreign Affairs. 
  Domarkas hopes that the treaty on the Lithuanian-Latvian sea 
border would be given final coordination by the Lithuanian and 
Latvian prime ministers on 19 January in Riga, where a 
tripartite meeting of the leaders of the three Baltic states 
will be held.
