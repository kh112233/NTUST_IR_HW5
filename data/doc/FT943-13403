FT  20 JUL 94 / Argentina seeks to trim civil service
Argentina plans to cut civil service costs by 10 per cent, and introduce
tighter tax controls and a range of export incentives, according to an
outline of the 1995 budget bill, released yesterday by the economy ministry.
However, based on average consumer and wholesale price inflation of 3.5 per
cent and GDP growth of 6.5 per cent in 1995, the budget promises to step up
spending on state-funded health and education.
The budget statement did not estimate the effect of these measures on total
public spending. However, in earlier estimates, the government had forecast
1995 total public sector spending at 81.9bn pesos (Pounds 52.5bn) - roughly
26.3 per cent of GDP - compared with 78.8bn pesos budgeted for this year, or
26.5 per cent of GDP.
The peso is at par with the US dollar.
Previous official figures have projected a federal revenue surplus of 4.5bn
pesos for the current year, and of 3.18bn-3.23bn pesos for 1995.
The government is under pressure to rein in public spending if it wishes to
maintain its economic reforms and sustain the dollar-peso parity established
in April 1991.
Mr Daniel Artana, chief economist at FIEL, an economic think-tank funded by
Argentina's leading companies, said the general feeling that the peso is
overvalued would be eased by the budget.
He also suggested that the tax revenue estimates were realistic. Tax
collection had increased by about 17 per cent in the first half of 1994,
compared with the equivalent period of 1993.
This rise took place despite cuts in payroll taxes, with most of it coming
from increased income tax collection and a crackdown on tax dodging. Tax
revenue has been forecast to rise to 30.8bn pesos next year, from an
estimated 26.5bn pesos in 1994.
The draft budget made no provisions for general pay rises, keeping salaries
tied to productivity levels in all departments. The cuts in civil service
costs are planned to fall largely on travel budgets and diplomatic postings.
The economy ministry estimated exports next year would rise by 13 per cent
to Dollars 17.4bn and put the trade deficit at Dollars 4.3bn. This year's
trade shortfall has been estimated to reach a new record of Dollars
4.5bn-Dollars 6bn, topping last year's Dollars 3.7bn deficit.
Reuter reports: Intelligence experts from Israel, Spain and other countries
arrived in Argentina yesterday to help hunt for the bombers of a Jewish
community centre in Buenos Aires. The blast, on Monday, killed 27 people.
