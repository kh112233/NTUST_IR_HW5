PHYSICAL FITNESS GOALS FOR '90 HELD UNLIKELY TO BE MET 
The Centers for Disease Control reported Friday that at least five of 11 
physical fitness goals for 1990, which it outlined at the beginning of the 
decade, probably won't be met. 
"Evidence indicates that regular physical activity reduces the incidence of . . 
. many medical conditions," the CDC said in its weekly report, citing the 
benefits of exercise in fighting heart disease, colon cancer, diabetes and 
obesity. 
Some of the government's 1990 "Objectives for the Nation," published in 1980, 
and the progress -- or lack thereof -- that has been made include: 
 -- The proportion of adults ages 18-65 participating three times a week in 
vigorous, 20-minute exercise should exceed 60%. Unlikely to be met; a 1984-87 
survey shows that about 8% of adults exercise regularly at such a level. 
 -- Half of Americans 65 and older should walk, swim or engage in other 
"appropriate" aerobic exercise at least three times a week. Not likely; a 1985 
survey showed that while 46% of older Americans said they walked for exercise, 
only 8% met the three-times-a-week, 20-minute level. 
 -- More than 90% of children ages 10-17 should participate three times a week 
in 20-minute sessions of vigorous exercise. Not likely to be met; a 1984 survey 
found that 66% of children exercised at that level.
