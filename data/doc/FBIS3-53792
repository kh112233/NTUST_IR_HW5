  [Text] The Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] Liaison 
Group session on Bosnia-Herzegovina concluded in Geneva with an 
18-point statement. In it, the foreign ministers in the group 
expressed their opposition to the occupation of the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by means of force, aggression, ethnic 
cleansing, and genocide and called for the return of refugees, 
homeless, and POW's to their homes. 
  In the statement, the ministers reiterated the willingness 
of 
some ICO member countries to provide peacekeeping forces under 
the aegis of the United Nations. Our colleague in Paris has 
sent us a report on the statement and the meetings of Foreign 
Minister Dr. Velayati: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] In the 
statement, the Islamic countries again stressed their 
categorical and urgent call to the United Nations to lift the 
arms embargo against the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina and to 
terminate the siege of Sarajevo. 
  Dr. Velayati, who is in Geneva to participate in the 
session, 
met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic on Monday [17 January] 
night. Izetbegovic described the peace proposals presented to 
the Muslims as unjust and criticized the international 
community's lack of support for ensuring the Bosnian Muslims' 
interests in these talks. He stated: The Serbs are perpetrating 
atrocities but are in a far better position than us. 
  Dr. Velayati stressed that for most Western countries, the 
term peace has lost its meaning as noble and just and he 
appraised Izetbegovic of his talks with the UN secretary 
general. At the conclusion of the Liaison Group session, Dr. 
Velayati met Butrus-Ghali and again stressed that Iran is 
willing to dispatch 5,000-10,000 peacekeeping troops to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He accused the Security Council of 
inattention toward the genocide of Bosnian Muslims and a lack of 
definite action against the Serbs. [end recording]
