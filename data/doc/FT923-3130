FT  14 SEP 92 / Kinkel plea for help on refugees
MR Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday issued a plea for
help in dealing with the refugee crisis, warning that Germany's political
stability was threatened by the flood of asylum-seekers from Yugoslavia and
eastern Europe, writes Lionel Barber.
Mr Kinkel said Germany was shouldering a disproportionate burden. Although
he avoided calling for quotas on refugees, the German foreign minister urged
greater understanding from EC countries.
Amid continuing riots in the former east Germany and attacks on refugee
hostels, Mr Kinkel said Germany had so far taken in more than 220,000 asylum
seekers from Bosnia  - more than any other country apart from neighbouring
Croatia. Millions more potential economic refugees were sitting on their
suitcases in eastern Europe, he said.
EC foreign ministers, meeting in Hatfield, expressed sympathy, but avoided a
commitment to spread the load by relaxing their own immigration controls.
Instead, they agreed to speed up Community efforts to reach a common
approach  - required because of the difference in laws.
EC justice and interior ministers are to meet in Brussels this week for
talks on immigration.
Ian Rodger adds from Vienna: The city of Vienna, fearing civil unrest
similar to that in Germany and facing a shortage of accommodation suitable
for the winter, has closed the doors of its publicly supported refugee
hostels to new Bosnian refugees. Other Austrian lander are expected to
follow the city's lead.
Mr Helmut Zilk, Vienna's democratic socialist mayor, said that the city's
'emotional capacity' to absorb refugees had been exhausted.
