  [Text] [Sendai] Tohoku Electric Power Co., Ltd. (Tohoku 
Electric), in cooperation with Professor Heiji Enomoto of Tohoku 
University, has developed a waste plastic recycling technology 
that uses a hydrothermal reaction. Plastic materials and water 
were placed in a pressurized vessel and were decomposed at a 
high temperature and under high pressure to a gasoline or 
grease-like, oily substance that was recovered. Compared to the 
existing plastic decomposition technology, the new technology 
does not require a catalyst, but uses only water for 
decomposition. In addition, the new technology permits the 
choice of decomposition products, which include light oil and 
grease. The technology appears to be promising for paving the 
way for effective recycling of plastic materials, which form a 
large part of wastes. 
  The new technology uses ``supercritical water'' at a 
temperature above 374C and under a pressure greater than 
22.1 MPa. Unlike ordinary water, supercritical water can break 
down plastics by being readily ionizable and miscible with oil. 
  Tohoku Electric placed polyethylene and water together in 
the 
pressure vessel, heated them to 400C, and confirmed the 
decomposition of polyethylene to oil containing paraffin and 
olefin after a reaction time of one to three hours. By changing 
the quantity of water, as well as the reaction temperature and 
time, Tohoku Electric was able to change the nature of the oil 
product, whose appearance ranged from gasoline to grease. It is 
also claimed that only aromatic compounds can be recovered. 
  Polyethylene is one of the plastic materials that are most 
difficult to decompose. The new ``hydrothermal reaction'' 
technology is said to be also capable of decomposing other 
plastic materials, such as polyester and polystyrene. The 
reaction produces only oil and water, but essentially no harmful 
by-products. Therefore, the technology is free of environmental 
problems, and the water can be re-used repeatedly in the process. 
  Previously, the so-called pyrolysis method had been studied 
to be used for plastic recycling. However, this method had 
several disadvantages, including the need for a catalyst, the 
slow rate of processing, the generation of by-products including 
cokes, and control difficulty.
