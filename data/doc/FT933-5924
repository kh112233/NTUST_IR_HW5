FT  01 SEP 93 / Body Shop to develop windfarm
BODY SHOP International, the toiletries and cosmetics group, yesterday moved
towards its goal of energy self-sufficiency, placing contracts for a 10MW
windfarm in mid-Wales, Michael Smith writes.
The company, which prides itself on its environmental policies, is committed
to producing the equivalent of its UK energy needs through wind power.
The farm at Bryn Titli, near Rhayader, will have 22 wind turbines of
37-metre diameter on 30-metre towers. It will generate enough electricity to
supply more than 7,000 homes.
Radnorshire District Council gave planning permission in spite of objections
from groups including the Countryside Council for Wales.
Windfarms are becoming controversial as their number grows. There are 14 in
operation in the UK and another six under construction.
The Body Shop farm is being built by National Wind Power, a company owned by
National Power, the electricity generator, and Taylor Woodrow, the
construction group. Investment in the farm is expected to be Pounds 11m and
National Power is providing finance.
