FT  04 MAR 93 / NCP chief reassured on 'moles'
MR GORDON LAYTON, the chief executive of National Car Parks, was given
repeated assurances about the legality of infiltrating 'moles' and other
covert methods used to investigate the company's main business rival, the
jury in the Old Bailey industrial espionage trial was told yesterday, John
Mason writes.
He trusted advice given to him by KAS, the security firm which carried out
the investigation of Europarks for NCP, that such techniques were both legal
and ethical, Mr Alex Carlisle, QC for Mr Layton, told the court.
These included surveillance of Europarks directors, the searching of rubbish
bins and the infiltration of KAS employees onto the Europarks staff.
Mr Layton, who has chosen not to go into the witness box to give evidence,
denies conspiring with Mr Simon Hewitt, a former KAS manager, to defraud
Europarks by dishonestly obtaining information about its business
activities.
The trial continues today.
