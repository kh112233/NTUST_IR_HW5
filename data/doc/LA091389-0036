Jurors in Charlotte, N.C., watched videos showing the opulent life style of PTL 
founder Jim Bakker, including a 4,000-square-foot suite in a hotel at the PTL 
ministry's Heritage USA theme park and retreat at Ft. Mill, S.C. The video tour 
was conducted by James Taggart, Bakker's former interior decorator, who was 
sentenced to 17 years in prison and fined $500,000 last week for tax evasion 
while at PTL. Taggart described gold-plated swan bathroom fixtures, antique 
beds and mirrored walls in the bedroom. Prosecutors say Bakker, who is charged 
with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, used nearly $4 million in ministry 
funds to finance a lavish life style. U.S. District Judge Robert Potter 
threatened to jail Bakker for the remainder of his trial because Bakker had 
failed to report to his probation officer for a weekly report on medication he 
is taking. Potter relented after defense lawyer Harold Bender said he -- not 
Bakker -- was responsible for violating the judge's order.
