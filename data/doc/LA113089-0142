TOO MANY 
Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators say they have one confession too 
many in the theft of a 17th-Century Dutch painting recovered at the apartment 
of two Lancaster men. 
Jereld Sharitz, 23, an art student at Antelope Valley College, where the 
painting was stolen Nov. 6, and Timothy Cain, a 27-year-old grocery clerk, were 
arrested Tuesday on suspicion of grand theft. Both confessed to taking the 
painting, "Nymphs Gathering Flowers in a Landscape," by Gerard Hoet, Detective 
J. Siebert said Wednesday. 
"They're probably trying to protect each other," he said.
