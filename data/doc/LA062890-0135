SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK; 
BIDS FOR CURBSIDE RECYCLING 
The City Council on Monday decided to put its curbside recycling contract out 
to bid instead of granting it to current waste hauler Athens Disposal. 
Monterey Park's recycling program will be citywide, rather than phased in, and 
will allow single-family residents to combine recyclable aluminum, glass, 
newspapers, cans and bottles in one container for pickup once a week. The City 
Council will also require the hauler to deposit trimmings from city parks and 
medians in compost bins.
