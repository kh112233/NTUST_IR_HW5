REGIONAL EARNINGS: SALES OF EPOGEN SEND AMGEN PROFITS SOARING 
Amgen Inc., a biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks that is reaping the early 
rewards of its new drug Epogen, said its fiscal first-quarter profit soared to 
$11.1 million from $835,000 a year earlier. 
The profit jump came on a surge in Amgen's revenue in the quarter that ended 
June 30, to $71.7 million from $28.5 million a year earlier. 
The higher revenue reflects growing sales of Epogen, the brand name for 
erythropoietin (EPO), which helps fight anemia in patients with such problems 
as kidney disease. 
Amgen gained federal regulatory approval to sell the drug a year ago, and since 
then it has sold the drug to about 65,000 patients on kidney dialysis, the 
company said. 
As Amgen's sales have continued to gain momentum, so has its stock. Amgen's 
stock closed Monday at $85.50 a share in over-the-counter trading, giving it a 
75% gain since Dec. 31 when it stood at $49 a share. 
So far, Amgen has the fledgling EPO market to itself, but that could change. 
Genetics Institute, based in Cambridge, Mass., and its partner, Chugai 
Pharmaceutical Co. of Japan, are fighting a patent battle with Amgen in the 
courts in order to get their version of EPO on the U.S. market. 
The case currently is before an appeals court in Washington, where oral 
arguments are scheduled to be heard in September. A lower court judge had 
effectively urged the companies to share the market.
