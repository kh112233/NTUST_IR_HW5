FT  24 MAY 94 / Swiss scientists reject EU ties
Five Swiss Nobel prize-winning scientists have urged the Swiss government to
reduce its contributions to European Union research projects, which they
consider politically motivated and a waste of money. The demand, in an open
letter, could hardly come at a worse time for Berne, which is desperately
trying to restart negotiations with the EU on reciprocal airline rights
among other delicate issues. The Swiss parliament is to debate a SFr554m
(Pounds 258.8m) contribution to EU research, some of it for a new three-year
programme, later this week. 'We view the planned joining of this new EU
research programme as primarily politically motivated,' the scientists said.
Mr Richard Ernst, Nobel laureate for chemistry in 1991 for his work on
magnetic nuclear resonance and one of the signatories of the letter, was
quoted as saying that Brussels-led research programmes were often amateurish
and suffered from excessive administration costs.
