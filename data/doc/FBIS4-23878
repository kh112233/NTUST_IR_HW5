  [Text] Nairobi, 17 Jun (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels freed about 
400 civilians in a commando raid early Friday [17 June] on a 
church behind government lines where militiamen are believed to 
have abducted and killed hundreds of people, a UN spokesman 
said. A spokesman for the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) 
said initial reports by a UN spokesman that the rebels had 
captured the Sainte- Famille church complex were based on "Army 
propaganda". "They want to massacre everyone there so that's 
why they're saying we're in control," said the spokesman, 
Colonel Frank Mugambage. 
  UN spokesman Pierre Mehu said a commando group of about 10 
RPF fighters had freed 400 civilians trapped in the church for 
more than two months around three A.M. (0100 GMT) Friday while 
other rebels created a diversion nearby. Mehu confirmed that 
the rebels had not, as initially believed, captured the church, 
where several thousand more civilians, including minority Tutsis 
and Hutus, are still stranded. 
  Hutu militiamen have abducted from the church and murdered 
hundreds of Tutsis and Hutus suspected of backing the opposition 
or the mainly Tutsi rebels. In the latest atrocity, militiamen 
abducted and probably killed 60 children and adolescents from 
the church Tuesday after preventing UN soldiers from evacuating 
them to safety. Up to half a million people have been butchered 
in Rwanda's 10-week bloodbath, triggered by the April 6 death of 
president Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, in a presumed rocket 
attack on his plane.
