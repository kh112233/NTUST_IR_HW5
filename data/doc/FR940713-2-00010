<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 
10 CFR 600.6(a)(2), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited
application meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) to Materials Technologies of Virginia, Inc. (MATVA) under
Grant Number DEFG0194CE15599. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated amount of $155,728
(DOE contributing $99,862 and MATVA contributing 
$55,866) for MATVA to use a new whisker growing technique to make and test a high temperature heat exchanger prototype.
The subject invention, ``An In-Situ Whisker Reinforced Glass Ceramic'' is a patented process for creating glass
ceramic materials with acicular (needle-shaped) titanium oxide reinforcing whiskers grown in-site in one step.
This new process is an enabling technology that could permit rapid and inexpensive production of titanium oxide whisker

reinforced materials at much lower energy, labor, and health related costs. 



</SUMMARY>
<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy has determined 
in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the application submitted by the Materials Technologies of Virginia, Inc.,
is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed project represents
a unique device for conserving energy by greatly reducing energy costs during fabrication, and by making superior
materials available for use in more efficient devices such as the heat exchangers for construction under this project
which will be submitted as prototypes for third party testing. The use of this device has a strong possibility for future
reductions in the Nation's energy consumption. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under
a recent, current or planned solicitation because the program, the Energy-Related Invention Program (ERIP), has
been structured since its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations 
because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The
program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation.
