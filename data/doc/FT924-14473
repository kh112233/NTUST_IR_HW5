FT  09 OCT 92 / Observer: Electrifying
Remember 'roach motels'? They are traps designed to destroy one of the more
troublesome inhabitants found in apartment blocks in big cities like New
York. 'They may check in but they never check out,' crowed the advertisers.
Unfortunately, the little critters quickly wised up to this trick and far
too many failed to check in in the first place.
However, the roaches of the industrialised world now face a more frightening
enemy - Greg Jeffreys, winner of Australia's Inventor of the Year award.
He's sold 10,000 of his Cockroach Zappers at home and is now entering the
hugely important Japanese market.
His plan is to fry the insects to death with a bolt of electricity.
'Controlling cockroaches with chemicals is very inefficient because they are
very clever and become immune to poisonous chemicals very easily,' he says.
He is happy to swallow his own bait to prove that it is harmless and
stresses that the resulting electric charge is weaker than the static
discharged by a woolly sweater.
