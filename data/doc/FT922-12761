FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: AHP posts 15% profits rise in
first quarter
A SHARP improvement in first-quarter results from American Home Products,
the US pharmaceutical company, prompted active trading in the company's
shares.
The New York-based company said net income grew 15 per cent to Dollars
406.3m, or Dollars 1.29 a share, in the first three months of 1992, compared
with Dollars 352.5m, or Dollars 1.12, a year earlier. Sales advanced 13 per
cent to Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.76bn.
Sales growth was led by American Home Product's consumer health care
business, which saw a 20 per cent increase to Dollars 438.8bn.
Pharmaceutical sales rose 16 per cent to Dollars 1.16bn, while medical
supplies and diagnostics were only 2 per cent higher at Dollars 197.8m. Food
products sales fell 1 per cent in the quarter.
The company said two new drugs - Lodine for osteoarthritis and its Norplant
birth control implant - contributed to the strong pharmaceutical sales.
Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to the figures, marking American Home
Products shares closed Dollars 4 higher to Dollars 81 3/4 in active trading.
Genentech, a leading US biotechnology company which is controlled by the
Swiss group Hoffmann-La Roche, yesterday unveiled first-quarter net earnings
of Dollars 3.5m, or 3 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 129m, against
income of Dollars 19.4m, or 17 cents, on sales of Dollars 99.5m last year.
The drop in income was attributed to the company's previously announced
increase in spending on research and development for 1992.
During the quarter, sales of Genentech's Protropin human growth hormone rose
10.3 per cent to Dollars 48.4m. Sales of the company's thrombolytic (clot
dissolver) Activase t-PA fell 19.8 per cent to Dollars 44.5m, reflecting
results of a controversial clinical trial.
