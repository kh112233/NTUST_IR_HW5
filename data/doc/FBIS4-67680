  [Text] Seventeen per cent of primary students in Ron Phibun 
district, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, suffer a form of skin 
cancer as a result of ingesting arsenic toxins in the local 
water, a Nakhon Si Thammarat provincial official said yesterday. 
  Eighty per cent of all residents in Ron Phibun district and 
some residents in nearby districts have arsenic toxins in their 
bodies. 
  The official said local water supplies are polluted by 
arsenic in run-off from ancient tin mines. 
  Consumption of arsenic toxins results in an illness the 
villagers call Khai Dam, or black fever, and induces a kind of 
skin cancer which shows as black spots. A survey of 718 primary 
students showed 125 of them, or 17.4 per cent, have black spots 
on their skin, according to the official. 
  The official said authorities on Tuesday had agreed to 
arrange new water sources for the villagers. 
  It was also planned to dig new water wells in Ron Phibun 
district and to educate villagers about black fever disease. 
  Dr. Chanphen Chupraphawan, from the Thai Public Health 
Research Institute, said providing clean, unpolluted water would 
be an effective way to prevent the spread of black fever. 
  Chanphen said within the next four years, teenagers in Ron 
Phibun will have an 80 per cent risk of getting black fever, 
which could lead to cancer of the lung, kidney and liver.
