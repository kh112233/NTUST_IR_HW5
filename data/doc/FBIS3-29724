  [Excerpt] Three trawlers were sunk in a battle between Thai 
navy gunboats and suspected Cambodian pirates off southeast 
Thailand, officials and witnesses said yesterday. Two Thai 
fishing boats and one pirate boat went down after catching fire 
during the fighting, witnesses said. The Thai boats were 
apparently caught in the crossfire between the navy and the 
pirates. The navy detained 14 suspected pirates. Witnesses 
said casualties must have been high as 40mm cannons, 
rocket-propelled grenades mortars and machine guns were used. 
The navy confirmed the battle but declined to give details of 
casualties. 
  The captain of a fishing boat sailing in the Gulf of 
Thailand 
near the Thai island of Ko Kut said the battle broke out on 
Saturday morning when three Thai navy boats exchanged fire with 
the suspected Cambodian pirates. 
  A naval officer from the patrol boat Kan Tang, which guards 
fishing boats in the area said the battle took place in an area 
about eight miles (13 km) south of Ko Kut. It started after the 
naval boats had gone to the assistance of Thai fishing boats 
which he said were being robbed by Cambodian pirates. 
  Witnesses at Klong Yai port in southeast Thailand said two 
navy gunboats arrived late on Saturday with 14 Cambodians on 
board. They were taken away to an undisclosed location. 
  Pirate attacks on fishermen in the Gulf of Thailand have 
been 
increasing at an alarming rate and forced the navy to provide 
round-the-clock security for the fishing fleet, fishing industry 
sources said. [passage omitted]
