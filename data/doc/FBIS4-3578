Hepatitis C"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Public Health is to introduce an 
instant test for the hepatitis C Virus in medical centres across 
the country this month. 
  The test, which can show up results in half an hour, will be 
applied to blood products in a bid to curb the spread of the 
chronic and sometimes fatal liver ailments caused by the virus. 
  About three per cent of China's 1.2 billion population carry 
the new virus strain. 
  Many hepatitis C victims contracted the virus through blood 
transfusions. 
  The instant test which will be used in the nation's 
hospitals 
and blood banks, was developed by the microbiological research 
department of the People Liberation Army's No. 2 Medical 
University. 
  Hepatitis C, which is mainly transmitted through blood, can 
lead to cirrhosis and cancer of liver. 
  About 90 percent of Chinese hepatitis cases caused by 
medical 
treatment are C type. 
  The PLA researchers studied the country's hepatitis C 
epidemics and established a virus gene bank.
