  [Text] The governments of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia 
consider it necessary to begin consultations with the Baltic Sea 
countries and international financial institutions on the 
possibility of drafting a joint power engineering project, the 
aim of which would be the linking of Norwegian gas deposits with 
consumers in Poland, Germany, and the Baltic states via Finland 
and Denmark. This was stated at a meeting of the prime 
ministers of the three Baltic states in Davos. 
  The project proposed by the Baltic states is intended to 
reduce the dependence of these countries on gas supplies from 
Russia. During the trilateral meeting, issues of cooperation in 
international organizations, as well issues of Baltic economic 
cooperation, were discussed.
