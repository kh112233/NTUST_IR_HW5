Character Type' Patent Usage Rights''] 
  [Summary] Beijing (XINHUA) -- The U.S. firm IBM Corporation 
recently in Beijing reached formal agreement with Beijing Wangma 
[3769 4316] Computer Corporation to purchase rights to use the 
patented ``Five-Stroke Character Type'' [wu bi zixing] computer 
Chinese-character input technique. This technique, invented by 
Wangma Computer Corp. Governor Professor Wang Yongming [3769 
3057 2494], has been patented in three nations--the U.S., 
Britain, and China. The technique covers 90 percent of domestic 
computer users and has found applications in the U.N. and 
Southeast Asia. The U.S. firm DEC and the Japanese firm Casio 
already reached agreement with Wangma Corp. for rights to use 
this patented technique, which has become for foreign computer 
makers a ``key'' to opening up the China market.
