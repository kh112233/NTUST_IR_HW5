PAIN-COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES 
I read with interest the story regarding the use of pain-compliance techniques 
by the police against the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. The article 
failed to mention some of the techniques used by O.R. to blockade clinic doors 
during a "rescue." 
I have witnessed their behavior on two separate occasions. Once in July at a 
Tustin clinic, and again last December in Fullerton. 
At the Tustin clinic, pro-choice "clinic defenders" were able to link arms to 
prevent O.R. from gaining control of the door. I saw O.R. attempt to use "human 
battering rams," i.e. groups of protesters (mostly large men) to slam through 
the pro-choice gauntlet (mostly women). I witnessed incidents of kicking, 
shoving, using keys to gouge, all perpetrated by these "nonviolent" terrorists. 
At one point, as a female staff member was trying to enter the clinic, her 
fingernails were broken and her I.D. badges and clothing were torn. 
I applaud the police in their use of methods to arrest these self-righteous 
lawbreakers. They are fully warned via a dispersal notice before arrests begin, 
and if they refuse to obey and go quietly, then they get what they deserve.
