VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO; 
COUNTY BOARD TO CONSIDER AIRPORT PLAN 
The Board of Supervisors will consider later this month whether to approve an 
agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration to build a permanent air 
traffic control tower at Camarillo Airport. 
The permanent tower would replace a 37-foot-high temporary tower erected at the 
airport last year. 
The agreement, which would give the county a 40-year lease on the new control 
tower when it is completed, is necessary because the FAA is providing the $1.5 
million needed to build the six-story structure. The supervisors will consider 
the agreement July 24. 
"It's long overdue," said James G. O'Neill, the airport administrator. 
The county has been seeking federal money for an air traffic control tower 
since 1982, when the annual number of landings and takeoffs at the county-owned 
airport first exceeded 200,000, O'Neill said. The FAA requires control towers 
at airports where operations exceed that number, he said. 
Last year, about 210,000 flights began or ended at the airport, airport 
spokesman Jeff McCaullay said. 
If the lease agreement is approved, construction on the permanent tower would 
begin in November, with work ending in May, 1992, McCaullay said. 
"It's not soon enough," he said. "Getting that brand new tower is like a 
windfall to us." 
The airport's three air traffic controllers now work in a cramped room 
supported by two large shipping crates. Controllers sitting in the 
glass-enclosed structure have a full view from three sides and a partial view 
from the fourth side, O'Neill said. 
"It's a no-frills tower and was never meant to be permanent," he said. 
The new tower will include office space, an elevator, restrooms and drinking 
fountains, O'Neill said. Controllers must now walk about 75 yards to the 
nearest restroom facility, he said. CAROLYN KUSKY
