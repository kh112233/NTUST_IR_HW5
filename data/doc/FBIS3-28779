  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Japan's Transport Ministry 
and the U.S. Department of Transportation have agreed to 
cooperate in research on transport-related technology, including 
the magnetically levitated transport system, ministry officials 
said Thursday [10 February]. 
  The officials said the two countries are expected to 
announce 
the contents of the agreement at a summit meeting in Washington 
between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Friday. 
  The agreement covers bilateral exchanges of information in 
17 
areas, including the development of technology to control 
automobile emissions, a system for using integrated circuits to 
examine commuter tickets, and a railway signaling system which 
relies on satellites. 
  The magnetically levitated transport system is seen as a 
possible superfast alternative to conventional road and rail 
transport. The vehicles rely on a magnetic field for propulsion 
along a fixed guideway. 
  The agreement also allows for the exchange of experts in 
these fields, the sources said. 
  The first meeting of experts will be held in early May, they 
said.
