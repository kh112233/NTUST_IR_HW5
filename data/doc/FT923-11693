FT  23 JUL 92 / Immune cell gives Aids hope
SCIENTISTS studying long-term survivors of HIV, the virus that causes Aids,
have discovered a type of immune cell which enables people to remain healthy
for more than 10 years after infection.
Dr Jay Levy, of the University of California, San Francisco, described the
discovery to the world Aids conference in Amsterdam yesterday. He predicted
that it would soon lead to new ways of treating HIV.
The vital finding is that a white blood cell, called CD8, seems to determine
how long people with HIV stay healthy. Its role is to attack other infected
cells - and either kill them or suppress the virus.
In most people with HIV the CD8 cells lose their activity after a while.
Then the CD4 cells - the immune cells whose loss is normally used to define
the progress of the disease - disappear and the patients start to suffer
Aids symptoms.
Dr Levy's researchers are purifying a protein, known as a cytokine, which
CD8 cells secrete to stop HIV replicating in other immune cells. They expect
to have isolated and identified it within six months.
