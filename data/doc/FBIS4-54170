<F P=106> ["South Korean Puppets Commit Military Provocation on the </F>
Sea" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets 
on May 25 perpetrated a grave military provocation by illegally 
infiltrating a group of combatant ships deeply into the western 
waters of our side. 
  At around 16 hours 33 minutes, three combatant ships of the 
puppet navy based in South Korean Taechong Islet infiltrated 
deeply into our side's waters South of Ochajin-ri, Yongyon 
County, South Hwanghae Province, in battle formation for the 
purpose of kidnapping our peaceful fishing boats openly in broad 
daylight. 
  They hurriedly fled South, failing to carry out their 
hostile 
scheme due to the quick sailing of a naval patrol craft of the 
Korean People's Army to the scene. 
  The reckless naval intrusion of the South Korean puppets was 
a premeditated provocation to incite North-South confrontation 
and lead the situation on the Korean peninsula to a higher pitch 
of strain. 
  If the South Korean puppets continue along the road of 
confrontation and war, ignoring the unanimous desire of the 
Korean people and the world peaceloving people for the peace of 
the Korean peninsula and its reunification, they will be meted 
out a stern punishment.
