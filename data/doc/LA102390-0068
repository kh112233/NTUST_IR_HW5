JEWISH LEADER PROTESTS NEO-NAZI RALLY IN DRESDEN 
The leader of Germany's Jewish community issued a strong protest Monday over a 
march on Saturday by several hundred neo-Nazis in the southeastern city of 
Dresden to protest the presence of Communists and foreigners in Germany. 
Heinz Galinski, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said the 
march "overstepped . . . the patience of democratic forces."
