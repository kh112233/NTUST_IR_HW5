BRIEFLY 
Fraud Claimed in Statue Sale: Two men who claimed they were sold a bogus 
half-interest in a purported Michelangelo statue filed a multimillion suit 
against the seller and international auction house Sotheby's Inc. The Los 
Angeles Superior Court suit filed by Ronald E. Faulk of Glendale and Robert E. 
Fitzgerald of Indianapolis claims that they were led to believe they were 
buying a 50% share of Michelangelo's model for the statue "David." After 
spending more than $500,000, the buyers learned that the statue is owned by 
someone else and is of "unknown origin," the suit said.
