FT  11 NOV 94 / Hussein meets Rabin in Israel
King Hussein of Jordan and the Israeli prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin,
exchanged the finally ratified versions of their recent peace treaty on the
shore of the Sea of Galilee yesterday. The king, who flew in by helicopter
from Amman, was making his first overt visit to Israel after earlier secret
meetings. An Israeli official said afterwards that embassies would open in
Amman and Tel Aviv within the next two or three weeks. Earlier yesterday,
Israeli and Jordanian ministers opened a second border crossing between the
two countries. It will enable Jordanian products to reach Haifa port for
shipment to Europe. The first crossing, inaugurated in August, links the Red
Sea cities of Eilat in Israel and Aqaba in Jordan.
