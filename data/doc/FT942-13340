FT  26 APR 94 / US bows to Jordan pressure on ships
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, began the first stage of a
week's trip to the Middle East yesterday by bowing to pressure from Jordan
for a basic change in the way cargo ships arriving at the port of Aqaba are
monitored.
The inspection of vessels is at present carried out at sea by Maritime
Interception Forces (MIF), stationed in the Tirain Strait, as part of UN
sanctions against Iraq. Jordan has claimed the delays caused by the
inspections have damaged its economy, and King Hussein warned recently his
government would not continue with the Middle East peace talks unless the
procedures were altered.
Mr Christopher said yesterday after talks with King Hussein, who is
recuperating from an ear operation near London, that this system would be
replaced by a land-based operation, as demanded by Jordan. Land-based
inspections would be performed by the independent Lloyd's Register of
Shipping. US officials said the new regime would be as effective, if not
more so, than the naval inspections.
Long delays at sea are caused by the inspections, while higher-than-normal
insurance premiums and the risk of being turned away have caused operators
to increase charges by Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 680) per 40ft container.
Mr Christopher and King Hussein also discussed efforts to push forward the
Middle East peace process and particularly, negotiations between Syria and
Israel which are due to resume next month.
Mr Christopher is due to visit Riyadh, Cairo, Damascus and Jerusalem.
Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin sought to ease the way for Mr
Christopher last week by warning Jewish settlers they would probably have to
leave the occupied Golan Heights as part of any lasting agreement with
Syria.
