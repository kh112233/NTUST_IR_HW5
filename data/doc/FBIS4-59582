  [Text] His Eminence Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, the eminent 
leader of the revolution, delivered a speech this morning in a 
meeting with people and officials involved in the country's 
press, in which he described the press as very important because 
of the effective and determining role it plays in guiding public 
opinion. He stressed the need for benefiting from the freedom of 
the press to raise the level of knowledge, information, 
farsightedness, insight, and broad-mindedness among the people. 
  The eminent leader said that the country's press community 
embraced the most prominent personalities from the world of 
culture, thought, and the written word, and he said the 
following about the importance of the work carried out by the 
press: The press and all publications hold a special and very 
important position because they play a constant role in guiding 
their readers, and because they influence the actions and 
behavior of society and, for this reason, working for the press 
must not be seen as a mere job. 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i went on to say the 
following 
about the duties and responsibilities of the press: The people 
involved with the press must possess greater knowledge, insight, 
and judgement than others with respect to all issues relating to 
daily life and social developments. On this basis, it is their 
duty to convey the required information to the people of this 
country and society, as well as to raise the people's level of 
knowledge in various fields, because the reason why the press 
comes into existence is to spread and publicize human knowledge 
and insight in various subjects. 
  The eminent leader of the revolution stressed that it was 
one 
of the duties of the press to politicize the people and the 
society and he added: In today's world, the press community must 
stride towards politicizing the people and towards propagating a 
spirit of being involved in and caring for politics among the 
people, because the public becomes less vulnerable in a 
politicized society. Increasing the people's capacity for 
political understanding and for analyzing and recognizing 
political trends, tendencies, and motives is a necessity in 
order to confront the ploys and conspiracies of the big news 
agencies; the press must fulfill its responsibilities towards 
this end. 
  Elsewhere in his speech, the eminent leader said that 
another 
duty of the press was to strengthen social ties and national 
unity, as well as to nurture self-confidence and hope in the 
future among all the people, adding: The press must fight 
against disunity, the loss of self-confidence, and the weakening 
of the national spirit, and it must pledge its loyalty to 
anything that leads to a coming together of and unity between 
all the members of the nation; it must strive to preserve our 
national identity and all the foundations of this entity and 
realm. 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said that the country's 
press -- regardless of their normal line -- must adopt a joint 
stance in response to enemy attacks and he said that this was 
one of the duties of a press belonging to the nation, adding: 
Elements within the press community who do not abide by the 
decisive and inviolable responsibilities of the press are guilty 
of injustice and making the press profane. 
  Stating that the freedom of the press today was 
unprecedented 
in the history of Iranian media, the esteemed leader of the 
revolution said: The press in Iran today has a more complete 
freedom in comparison to all other periods and every writer and 
thinker can write and publish whatever he thinks. 
  Referring to unhappiness among some officials regarding some 
publications, articles, and writers as a clear sign for the 
existence of press freedom, the esteemed leader said: Those who 
use the press freedom to bring dissatisfaction among sincere, 
enthusiastic, and selfless officials of the country are 
committing an indecent act but meanwhile some pretend that the 
writers are working under the threat of naked swords. However 
you all know that no naked sword threatens writers and 
journalists. 
  His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i called on the press to pay 
attention to the need for discipline, as well as respect for law 
and set limits and said: Those in the press community who 
understand the circumstances and enjoy work ethics must use 
press freedom and the opportunity it provides in full to improve 
popular understanding, knowledge, vision, intellectualism, and 
clear vision, to compensate for the existing underdevelopment 
and to utilize the many existing potentials and the extensive 
material and spiritual possibilities of the country. 
  The esteemed leader of the country said the general 
situation 
with the press in the country, despite some positive points, was 
not satisfactory, and referring to inclinations in the press 
towards populism and popularism added: A press which acts 
according to popular taste can not progress, because in all 
countries the press must be a leader not a follower. 
Furthermore, the press must fight low productivity and value 
the serious writing of articles, analysis, and scientific work. 
  Stating that it was wrong to publish the analytic-type news 
that is produced by Zionist news agencies and broadcasting 
organizations in the country's press, the esteemed leader of the 
revolution said: Many news reports of arrogant news agencies and 
Zionist broadcasting organizations -- which are fully published 
in the Iranian press -- are not truly news, but their biased 
analysis and views which are reproduced in the form of news. 
The Iranian press should therefore be vigilant and should not 
become the instrument of foreign powers' media and it is 
therefore necessary to fully and correctly understand their news 
and publish them only after separating the news essence from the 
analysis. 
  Criticizing some of the country's press for failing to see 
the enmity of the enemies of the Islamic order, his eminence 
Ayatollah Khamene'i said: Neither one of our enemies is 
gentleman-like and we have seen no gentlemanly behavior from 
America, Britain, Zionists, the defunct regime of apartheid in 
South Africa, and the communists. Their ungentlemanly and 
cowardly behavior made us realize and better understand them. 
The enmity of the enemy therefore must not be overlooked 
because it awaits every opportunity to bring down a blow against 
us. 
  Stating that West's intolerance regarding the Islamic dress 
of Muslim women or a true article in their press clearly 
indicated the West's bias and petrification as well as the rule 
of passions and tribal bias in Europe, the leader of the Islamic 
revolution finally said: The press in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran have a truly important position because the strength of the 
country as well as the improvement of civilization and social 
culture depends on the situation of the press and those involved 
in the press must try to execute this great responsibility as 
well as possible. 
  Prior to the speech by the esteemed leader, Mr. Mirsalim, 
the 
minister of culture and Islamic guidance, spoke briefly about 
journalists as the those who recognize the difficulties of the 
country's cultural domain and stressed the need to follow the 
strategy of the esteemed leader in order to fight ignorance, 
inability, decadence, and promote knowledge, thought, research 
and correct understanding.
