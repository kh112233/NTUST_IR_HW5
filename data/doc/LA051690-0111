FIGHTING TERROR IN THE SKY 
The following are among the recommendations of the President's Commission on 
Aviation Security and Terrorism. 
SECURITY MEASURES 
The FAA must develop stronger security for checked baggage, persons with access 
to aircraft and screening of passengers. 
The FAA administrator should establish an office of security reporting directly 
to administrator. 
The FAA should defer any program of purchasing new passenger screening 
equipment until it is sensitive enough to detect very small amounts of plastic 
explosives. 
DEALING WITH TERRORISTS 
The United States should ensure that all government resources are prepared for 
active measures -- preemptive or retaliatory, direct or covert -- against 
targets in countries engaged in state-sponsored terrorism. 
The United States must refuse to allow terrorist attacks to alter U.S. 
political and economic policies. 
TREATMENT OF VICTIMS' FAMILIES 
The State Department should always contact victims' families, even when airline 
already has announced deaths. 
The State Department should, whenever possible, assign to each family one 
person and an alternate to act as liaison. 
The President should seek legislation authorizing and permanently appropriating 
funds to provide monetary benefits and tax relief for any American victim of a 
terrorist act.
