SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
The defense rested its case Thursday in the fraud and tax evasion trial of 
Nancy Hoover Hunter. Closing arguments in the lengthy trial will begin today 
and last three days. 
Hunter concluded her testimony Thursday after nine days on the witness stand in 
the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam. 
Her attorneys are trying to prove that she was unaware of J. David (Jerry) 
Dominelli's fraudulent activities, which led to 1,200 investors losing nearly 
$90 million when J. David &amp; Co. collapsed in February, 1984. 
The defense claims that Hunter was blinded by love for Dominelli, with whom she 
shared a $2-million Rancho Santa Fe home, and could not see through the lies 
told to her by the convicted swindler and his close circle of associates.
