FT  11 MAY 91 / Scottish Conservative Party Conference: Leaders step up
pressure on Saddam
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday stepped up the pressure on President Saddam Hussein
of Iraq with a threat to veto any lifting of United Nations sanctions as
long as the present regime held power in Iraq.
His announcement, at the conference in Perth, was designed to emphasise that
Britain is not prepared to see President Saddam re-admitted to the
international community even if Iraq complies fully with the UN ceasefire
agreement.
Mr Major also reaffirmed his determination to secure agreement at the UN by
the end of this year on an international arms register, which would require
every country to spell out what arms they sold, to whom they were sold and
in what quantity.
His warning to Iraq came as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warned
that Britain's relations with Iran will remain difficult as long as British
hostages are held in Lebanon.
Mr Hurd insisted that the government was determined to push ahead with its
plan for a UN police force to protect Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq.
His decision to focus on the plight of the three British hostages still held
in Lebanon - Mr Terry Waite, Mr John McCarthy and Mr Jack Mann - reflected
his concern to emphasise that the Foreign Office had not given up hope of
securing their release.
The foreign secretary said he was also demanding the release by Baghdad of
two Britons held in Iraqi jails.
