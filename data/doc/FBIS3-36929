  [Text] Since the beginning of the year, Russian border 
guards have detained about 300 trespassers. 
  Colonel Aleksandr Manilov, the head of the information and 
analytical department of the Russian border troops' General 
Staff, announced that jointly with customs personnel Russian 
border guards had also detained about 80 units of firearms and 
400 kilograms of drugs. 
  The situation on the Tajik-Afghan borders is the most 
serious. Since the beginning of the year, more than 20 attempts 
have been made to cross this border. On 14 occasions border 
guards had clashes with bandit units during which 18 trespassers 
were killed. The border posts have been attacked 47 times, 
including 14 times from Afghan territory. The Russian border 
guards have not sustained any losses. 
  Manilov believes that armed provocations and attempts to 
cross the border will continue, most of all in the section 
controlled by the Pyanj detachment. 
  Speaking about the Japanese vessels' illegal fishing in the 
Russian territorial waters near the Kuril islands, Manilov said 
that border troops fully controlled the situation and would curb 
any violations according to the law on state borders.
