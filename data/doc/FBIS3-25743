  [Text] Antonio Jamba Conomuissa, party secretary for Negola 
Commune, says civilians have been murdered and tortured. 
Conomuissa said this week fighter bombers from Lubango attacked 
the villages of Ucua, Canopa, Vila Branca, and Cucesse, killing 
50 civilians. Most of the victims were elderly people and 
children. Conomuissa said the enemy abducted 57 civilians from 
(Sicocosse), Cambiri, and Capeua. The civilians were killed and 
their corpses abandoned on the road. Those who escaped from the 
attacks were killed in explosions caused by land mines that Joao 
de Matos' men planted in roads leading to farms. The situation 
is worrying the residents of those areas.
