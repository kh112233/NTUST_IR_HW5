FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Corning share price tumbles more
than 13%
THE share price of Corning, the US consumer products group, tumbled more
than 13 per cent on Wall Street yesterday after US newspapers reported that
its subsidiary, Dow Corning Wright, had resisted pressure from its
scientists to conduct critical safety studies of the company's silicone
breast implants, writes Patrick Harverson.
Dow Corning is the leading producer of the implants, and yesterday's
revelations follow last week's call by the US Food and Drug Administration
for a moratorium on the sale and use of the implants pending the completion
of new safety tests. The reports claimed internal documents showed Dow
Corning had rushed the implants onto the market in 1975 before doing proper
safety tests, and had mislead plastic surgeons about the risks of silicone
leaking from the implants into the the body.
Dow Corning maintains the implants are safe and the documents cited in the
press are being misinterpreted.
