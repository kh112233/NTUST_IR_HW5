  [Text] New York, United Nations, April 19, IRNA -- The 
Contact Group of the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
(OICCG) here Monday [18 April] called for the lifting of arms 
embargo on Bosnian Muslims and reaffirmation of their inherent 
right of self-defense. 
  In its statement issued after an urgent meeting on the 
situation in Gorazde, the OICCG on Bosnia-Herzegovina criticized 
the United Nations and the Security Council for failing to adopt 
effective measures against Serbs brutalities. 
  It said that the failure in undertaking steps against Serbs 
crimes has put into serious question the credibility of the 
secretariat, the Security Council and the credibility of the 
United Nations as a whole. 
  The statement also said that the OICCG has decided to call 
for an emergency session of the OIC and as a whole and for 
meeting of foreign ministers of the group in New York with a 
view to pursuing potential solutions to the Bosnian crisis which 
have thus far not been employed. 
  The OICCG further reaffirmed its support for the just 
struggles of the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina to live in freedom 
and harmony and said it stood ever ready to assist the United 
Nations by way of troops and financial contribution to UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Force].
