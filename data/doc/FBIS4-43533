<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Triads From China and Mafia Members </F>
From the Balkans"] 
  [Text] The Russians do not have a monopoly. In China and 
Hong Kong, too, there are Mafia-like structures -- the so-called 
triads. They are primarily organizing the smuggling of people. 
  How the gigantic profits are invested was cautiously 
indicated by Interior Minister Loeschnak in his book 
People From Abroad, Refugees, Expellees, Guest 
Workers: 
  "At the moment 346 Chinese restaurants are registered in the 
trade register in Vienna alone.... Even though I do not 
overestimate these findings and know that there are many `good' 
Chinese, the security authorities are of the opinion that these 
Chinese restaurants form the pillars of a dynamic, rigidly 
organized, perfectly and professionally working, cohesive 
system." 
  The Chinese do figure prominently in money laundering and 
these restaurants are excellently suited for that purpose. 
  Money laundering always works where there is a large and 
sophisticated network of restaurants. 
  Just like Turkish-Kurdish organizations, the Chinese triads 
also benefit from the extortion of protection money. 
  Over the past few months criminals from the former 
Yugoslavia 
have repeatedly come under the heading of "mafia." The 
expression "Yugo Mafia" is, however, exaggerated, Josef Dick, an 
official of the Interior Ministry, says. "Even though there is 
organized crime, there is no large network of gangs in the 
background, such as in Russia or China." Over the past years the 
"Yugo Mafia" has primarily attracted attention because of its 
activities in connection with the acquisition of weapons, but it 
also earns money with prostitution. Almost the entire scene 
red-light district of Vienna is in its hands.
