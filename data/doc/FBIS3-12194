  [Text] Barukh Goldstein, the man who perpetrated the 
murder in the Cave of the Patriarchs, was beaten to death, 
apparently by enraged Arab worshipers. These are the 
conclusions of a preliminary investigation carried out by the 
police investigators. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky was 
informed by the Judaea District Police that Goldstein's skull 
was crushed by blows; there were no gunshots to his body. The 
Police therefore rule out the possibility that Goldstein was 
shot or that he committed suicide, and apparently there will be 
no need to carry out an autopsy.
