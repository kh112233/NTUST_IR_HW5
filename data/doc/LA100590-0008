SURROGATE MOM'S CUSTODY CLAIM 
I think that you should have given more thought to your editorial ("Give the 
Baby to the Genetic Parents," Sept. 22) position in the "Baby Boy Johnson" 
case. The problem appears to be more complex than your editorial would 
indicate. Traditionally, the birth mother has custody of a child. But is this 
because she is the genetic parent or because she has biologically supported the 
growing fetus? Until modern technology made it possible to transplant a tiny 
embryo into the womb of a surrogate "mother," this question never came up. 
Certainly, being a genetic mother does not give one inviolable rights or 
adoptive parents would have no legal standing. But, you say, in this case the 
Calverts never gave up the baby; they had a contract. Well, I seem to recall 
that contracts selling human beings are void, against public policy -- 
something to do with slavery. In any case, what the Calverts gave up was a 
fertilized ovum, not a human, at least according to the laws of California. The 
nurturing, the life blood and the suffering that was required to change that 
blip of protoplasm into a human being was provided by Anna Johnson -- the 
mother. Now, you have decided that the mother should give up her child to the 
"genetic" parents because of some contract. It seems to me that all that can be 
had from Johnson is a refund of the $10,000. 
I wonder, if Johnson was not a poor black, would you be so willing to take the 
child from her? Certainly, the baby will have more advantages with his 
"genetic" parents. But the bonding of a birth parent is of considerable value, 
too. The point is, I think, that we must outlaw this whole surrogate process 
that treats a birth parent like a vending machine and reduces the mystery of 
human conception to an exercise in contract law.
