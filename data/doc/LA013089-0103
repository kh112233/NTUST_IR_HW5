ARTS; 
REMBRANDT, 2ND OIL STOLEN; 2 HELD 
A Rembrandt and another 17th-Century Dutch painting were stolen from a 
government art warehouse, and police today arrested a warehouse employee and 
her boyfriend as suspects, officials said. 
The two paintings, "Man With Beard," a 1647 work by Rembrandt, and "Winter 
Landscape With Skaters," a 1649 painting by Jan van Goyen, were reported 
missing from the warehouse here on Jan. 20, according to police spokesman Nico 
Laterveer. The disappearance was made public only today "so as not to 
jeopardize the investigation," Laterveer said. 
The two suspects, identified only as a 22-year-old administrative employee of 
the warehouse and her boyfriend, remained in custody. A search of their 
apartment failed to yield the paintings, whose combined value was estimated at 
between $474,000 and $711,000.
