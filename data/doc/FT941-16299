FT  11 JAN 94 / Wars across the water: Ticket prices for a Channel crossing
The children are restless. The drive to Dover is taking its toll on tempers.
French shops and beaches beckon. But first you have to cross the Channel. Do
you take advantage of special offers from ferry operators and take your
family on 1 1/2 hour - possibly choppy - sea passage for as little as Pounds
20? Or do you use the newly-opened Channel tunnel for Pounds 240 and a
27-minute crossing?
The question will face many families this summer. Already it is plaguing the
Channel tunnel operators. If enough British families choose the faster route
to the continent after the tunnel opens on May 7, the project should soon
start to pay off the estimated Pounds 10bn construction cost. If families
choose a rival form of transport, then Eurotunnel's financial projections
will once again need to be revised.
Some idea about how competitive the tunnel will prove should emerge today
when Mr Christopher Garnett, commercial director of Eurotunnel, unveils the
fares to be charged by Le Shuttle, which will carry travellers and their
vehicles through the tunnel between Folkestone and Calais. The announcement
will mark the tunnel's transition from ambitious construction project to
operating transport system which has to attract business.
'The classic argument is that once the tunnel has been built all its
problems are behind it,' says Mr Richard Hannah, a critic of the project and
transport analyst with UBS, the securities house. 'But now we are moving
into the phase of testing the market and that is the riskiest time for the
project.'
At first sight, the market seems buoyant. Cross-Channel traffic, by air and
ferry, has increased by 48 per cent over the past 10 years. Last summer
alone, the number of passengers on the Dover-Calais ferry crossings rose by
a remarkable 25 per cent, helped by attractive price discounts and a revival
in the UK economy.
Nevertheless the Channel crossings market is fiercely competitive. The ferry
companies have had six years, since construction of the tunnel began, to
prepare for its opening: service has been improved and and many ferries are
now close to cruise liners in the amenities they offer.
Le Shuttle prices have been pitched at about the middle of the range of
ferry charges - indicating the tunnel's operators are not seeking to
undercut rivals or to claim that the tunnel will offer a premium service
justifying premium prices. Early indications suggest they will start at
Pounds 160 return for a car and five passengers in the low season, rising to
between Pounds 220 and Pounds 260 in the summer peak.
In comparison, Stena Sealink, one of the two ferry operators on the
Dover-Calais route, last week announced fares starting at Pounds 126 and
rising to Pounds 220 in the summer peak. That is lower than 1993's top rates
but represents an overall increase of about 1-2 per cent over last year.
But given the nearly Pounds 10bn invested in construction costs and the low
marginal cost of running extra trains, Eurotunnel could find itself under
pressure to discount fares. In the early years at least the Eurotunnel will
be scrambling to make up revenues lost by delays in construction and rolling
stock deliveries.
The company has been forced several times in recent years to revise down its
revenue projections, most notably for the first few years of operation. The
latest forecast - on which today's pricing figures have been based - suggest
a turnover of Pounds 224m in 1994, rising to Pounds 690m in 1996. But the
latter figure will still be little more than Eurotunnel's interest charges,
currently about Pounds 650m a year.
So the key to Eurotunnel's success will lie in its ability not merely to
steal passengers from the ferries but to generate new business and exploit
the principle that new transport projects, such as motorways, increase the
number of journeys made.
One option would be to create a market by offering cheap fares to fill the
shuttles during quiet periods. Mr Alastair Dick, an independent transport
consultant, says: 'I would expect them to create a major new off-season
market for quick trippers by offering attractive off-season fares.' There is
also potential for attracting continental car trippers into Britain: at
present it is mostly the British who take their cars across the Channel.
Low season discounts are one thing, but to succeed Eurotunnel must charge
commercially-viable rates for the bulk of its business over the long term.
In the City there is some scepticism about how easy this will prove. 'If you
want to give yourself a fright, look at the airline industry where fares
have fallen because of product innovation and the high levels of
competition,' says Mr Hannah. UBS calculates ferry and airline fares between
the UK and France will continue to fall by between 2 and 4 per cent a year
in real terms, increasing pressure on Eurotunnel.
In response, SG Warburg Securities, stockbroker to Eurotunnel, says
published cross-Channel ferry tariffs rose in real terms in the 1980s and
that the analogy with the airline industry is false because the pace of
technological change is slower in the ferry business. The Dover-Calais route
is also used as a benchmark for setting fares on other short-sea routes from
the UK, and to cut ferry prices on this route would trigger cuts on others,
hitting the profitability of ferry operators.
Warburg estimates the average cost of crossing the Channel will fall by 12
per cent in real terms between 1994 and 1997 but will then rise in line with
inflation. However, part of the reason for fares rising will be the ending
of duty free sales in 1998.
But there remains the danger of published prices being undercut. The family
taking its car on the shuttle for its annual summer holiday is just one part
of the market. Many coach operators and road haulage operators will
negotiate special deals way below the posted tariffs.
'We negotiate a single tariff for the whole year and we would expect to pay
the same rate to use the tunnel as we do for the ferries,' says Mr John
Gilbert, general manager of Eurolines UK, part of the National Express coach
group.
At the same time families from, say, the Midlands may welcome the chance to
relax and enjoy a meal on the slower ferries while truck drivers may use the
time for obligatory rest periods.
The history of Eurotunnel is littered with missed and revised forecasts.
Projecting fares and revenues remains fiendishly difficult. What is certain
is that today's announcement will be only the first shot in what could be a
bitter and protracted contest between the ferries and Le Shuttle.
Eurotunnel's shareholders and bankers will watch anxiously but
cost-conscious travellers can only benefit.
