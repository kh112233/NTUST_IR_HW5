FT  02 MAY 91 / Ulster job creation at peak
THE LOCAL Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU), Northern Ireland's small
business agency, helped create almost 7,000 jobs last year according to
figures published yesterday, writes Our Belfast Correspondent.
Mr Chris Buckland, the unit's chief executive, said the figure of 6,986 -
against a target of 6,000 for the year ending March 31 - was the best since
the agency was set up 20 years ago. A record Pounds 34.7m was invested in
LEDU-backed projects.
Commenting on the government's decision to concentrate on helping companies
improve competitiveness, Mr Buckland said this had brought about a change in
the emphasis for awarding grants to small companies.
LEDU deals with companies in the province employing 50 or fewer people,
identifying areas where it can help with growth.
Unionist and Nationalist political leaders in Northern Ireland yesterday
called for a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, to demand the
shelving of plans to privatise the province's electricity industry.
