A LOOK AT THE ENEMY: CANCER 
THE DISEASE 
There are more than 100 types of cancer. Most fall into two categories: 
sarcomas or carcinomas. 
Carcinomas are cancers of the type of tissue that forms skin and the lining of 
major organs. Eighty percent to 90% of all cancers are carcinomas. 
Sarcomas are cancers of the connective tissue, such as bone and cartilage. 
Cancer cells differ from normal cells in three main ways: They reproduce 
faster, migrate to other parts of the body and don't have specialized 
functions. 
THE NUMBERS 
A little more than 1 million Americans will be found to have cancer this year. 
About half a million will die from it. 
For all cancers combined, the number of new cases each year increased 10.7% 
between 1973 and 1985, the latest year for which statistics are available. 
The most dramatic increase between 1973 and 1985 was for melanoma of the skin, 
which increased 60%. Excessive sun exposure is the primary cause. 
The greatest decline between 1973 and 1985 was for cervical cancer, which 
dropped 35%. Early detection and greater use of Pap smears are credited. 
Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States and the 
major cause of cancer death. Most lung cancer is caused by cigarette smoking. 
Among women, lung cancer incidence increased 81% between 1973 and 1985. For 
men, it increased 14.3%. 
THE SURVIVAL RATE 
The rate of people who survive cancer and are disease-free five years after the 
diagnosis is now about 50%. Cancers with higher survivability rates are: 
testis, 90%; colon, 54%, and breast, 74%. Cancers with lower rates are: 
leukemia, 31%; lung, 13%, and stomach, 16%. 
THE COSTS 
Taking into account hospital costs, the loss of job productivity and the loss 
of employable years, cancer costs about $72 billion a year in the United 
States. 
Cancer accounts for about 10% of the cost of all disease in the United States. 
On average, the person who dies from cancer dies 15 years earlier than his or 
her normal life expectancy. Lung cancer accounts for a loss of about 1.8 
million years of life every year. 
THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGHS 
The discovery of oncogenes has probably been the most important cancer research 
discovery in the past two decades. Oncogenes are abnormal genes that appear to 
be capable of "ordering" a cell to become a cancer cell. Although scientists 
have identified about 20 human oncogenes, they have yet to unravel the 
mysteries of the how the "ordering" occurs. 
The discovery of substances called anti-oncogenes may prove to be equally 
important. Anti-oncogenes are substances that somehow "turn off" cancer cells 
and transform them back to normal cells. (Proteoglycans, the substance that the 
La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation is working with, is an anti-oncogene.) 
Research on anti-oncogenes is at an early stage and the potential for use in 
treatment is unknown. 
Much of the recent progress in research can be credited to the discovery of 
monoclonal antibodies, genetically engineered antibodies that can be created in 
great quantities in the laboratory. The human immune system creates many kinds 
of natural antibodies to foreign proteins, such as viruses. Some natural 
antibodies may neutralize the proteins; others may not. In contrast, monoclonal 
antibodies are designed to seek out and attack specific proteins. They have 
become an important tool for isolating and identifying specific cell parts and 
cell mechanisms. They are used to a limited degree as diagnostic tools. 
Scientists are also working to couple monoclonal antibodies with 
cancer-fighting drugs to more effectively target treatment. 
Progress has been made with conventional cancer treatments, particularly in the 
area of chemotherapy. Doctors now know that combinations of certain drugs can 
effectively treat some types of leukemia that previously would not respond well 
to any single drug. New methods of delivering anti-cancer drugs also have been 
developed that have proved more effective. At UC San Diego Cancer Center, an 
experimental treatment for ovarian cancer has shown promise. It involves 
administering high concentrations of cancer drugs through an abdominal catheter 
and applying more directly greater doses of drugs than standard intravenous 
treatment currently allows
