  [Text] In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper 
AL-SAFIR, King Husayn of Jordan has stated that the latest 
Jordanian agreement with Israel comes within the framework of 
safeguarding the Kingdom of Jordan, its future, and borders. He 
tacitly admitted that this step was a kind of unilateral action. 
He said he was surprised by the Syrian reaction to the 
agreement, saying: Brother President Hafiz al-Asad knows me 
well and our relations are based on truthfulness and sincerity. 
King Husayn said that Arab coordination was mere talk without 
substance.
