  [Text] Ljubljana, March 4 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia has a public 
debt of nearly four billion dollars, the Bank of Slovenia 
(central bank) has said, making it clear this is only an 
unofficial estimate. This figure does not include the sum owed 
to depositors in neighbouring Croatia by the former Zagreb-based 
branch of Ljubljanska Banka, which Croatia insists exceeds 600 
million dollars. 
  On Thursday, Slovenia gave its first intimation that it has 
no intention of beginning to pay off its debt to the Croatian 
depositors this year. 
  Political and banking circles in Ljubljana expect the delay 
in paying money back to the Croatian depositors to provoke fresh 
differences in the already strained relations between the 
neighbours. Difficulties in relations between the two former 
Yugoslav republics, which have violently seceded from 
Yugoslavia, have become apparent earlier this year. 
  Trouble first surfaced because of Slovenia's refusal to 
deliver electricity from the jointly-built Krsko nuclear power 
plant because of Croatia's tardiness with the payments. Another 
bone of contention has been the Slovenian-Croatian common border 
in Istra. Last week, Slovenian police seized a Croatian boat in 
the Bay of Piran, for allegedly poaching in Slovenian 
territorial waters.
