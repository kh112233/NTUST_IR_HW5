BREA MAN, 22, DIES IN CAR CRASH 
A 22-year-old Fullerton College student was killed instantly when his car 
crashed into a six-foot concrete wall in Placentia, authorities said today. 
Jack Harvey Cook of Brea was ejected about 20 feet from his 1964 Volkswagen 
after it struck a curb before crashing into the wall. 
Cook's body was hurled into the wall before landing on the sidewalk, Placentia 
Police Sgt. Jay Fricke said. 
The incident occurred Wednesday on Bastanchury Road as Cook was heading home, 
Fricke said. Eyewitnesses reported that the Fullerton College student was 
driving between 50 and 60 m.p.h. in a 40-m.p.h. zone. He was alone in the car, 
authorities said. 
Fricke said investigators are awaiting the results of toxicological tests from 
the Orange County Coroner's Department to determine whether Cook was driving 
under the influence of alcohol.
