FT  18 APR 91 / Tranquilliser case claims multiply
THE NUMBER of alleged victims of tranquilliser addiction bringing claims
against Roche and Wyeth, the drug companies, has almost doubled to 6,000
since the High Court cleared the way for a 'group action' against the
manufacturers of benzodiazepine drugs in January.
Mr Paul Balen, the chairman of the Benzodiazepine Solicitors Group which is
co-ordinating what will be the largest personal injury action brought in the
UK, said yesterday that applications for legal aid from alleged victims
wanting to join the group action were mounting at the rate of 40 a day.
Nearly 6,000 applications for legal aid have been made by potential
claimants to date. Legal aid has already been granted to 3,800 of them.
The number of solicitors' firms in England and Wales handling claims has
increased from 575 in January to 962.
Most of the claims relate to Ativan made by Wyeth and Valium made by Roche.
The claimants allege negligence against the two drugs companies for failure
to give adequate warnings to doctors in accompanying drugs literature that
the pills should only be used in limited circumstances because of the danger
that patients would become dependent on them. In relation to Ativan, it is
also alleged that the manufacturer recommended too high a dose.
At a preliminary hearing in the High Court last week, Mr Justice Ian
Kennedy, the judge appointed to supervise the litigation, authorised the
addition of Librium and Serenid to a list of 15 brand-named drugs which he
approved for inclusion in January. Librium is made by Roche and Serenid by
Wyeth.
Mr Justice Kennedy is expected to set a 'cut-off date' for claimants wanting
to join the group action.
Mind, the mental health charity, says that more than a million people in the
UK may have been addicted to benzodiazepines.
