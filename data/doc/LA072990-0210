FEARS GROW OVER SKEWED ETHNIC MIX IN SCHOOLS; 
EDUCATION: NEW NORTH COUNTY CLASSROOMS ARE BEING FILLED PREDOMINANTLY WITH 
WHITE STUDENTS WHILE OLDER SCHOOLS NEAR CITY CENTERS ARE OVERLOADED WITH 
MINORITIES. 
As more minority students enroll in existing schools, and because most Tnew 
schools are being built in white areas, North County classrooms are growing 
increasingly segregated, raising fears that "inner-city" schools are developing 
in the suburbs. 
In one Escondido school, 92% of the students are white; in another, only 32% 
are white. Two of Carlsbad's elementary schools have seen the ethnic-minority 
population grow to more than 55%, but a new school in the district will have 
less than 10% minority students. 
School officials say the racial makeup of communities changes so quickly and in 
such concentrated ways that they can't change the school boundaries fast enough 
to keep a balance. 
But some parents and teachers say that districts have had ample opportunities 
to adjust attendance boundaries to achieve better racial balance, and they 
accuse district administrators of neglecting schools with large Latino 
populations, which tend to be older and sometimes more crowded than other 
schools. 
One teacher at San Marcos Elementary charges that not only are Latino students 
being "dumped" into the school -- one of the oldest in San Marcos Unified -- 
but also that their needs are being ignored. 
"I would like to see at least an ethnic balance close to what the other schools 
in the district have," said Rudy Gutierrez, a bilingual education teacher at 
San Marcos Elementary, where minorities make up two-thirds of the student 
population. "I just don't understand why, rather than trying to balance out the 
population, they increased the minority population another 3 or 4%." 
But school officials say that San Marcos Elementary's location makes it the 
hardest to balance out. 
"Probably the place that is most difficult to achieve balance is in schools 
that already exist because, then you're talking about a significant dislocation 
of people," said Mac Bernd, superintendent of San Marcos Unified. 
A parent at a recent San Marcos Unified school board meeting expressed fear 
that San Marcos Elementary is developing into an "inner-city school." 
San Marcos Unified is typical of school districts across North County that are 
experiencing not only tremendous growth, but also increased proportions of 
minority, especially Latino, students. 
"We grew by about 700 to 800 students this year, and probably three quarters of 
that was Hispanic," said Joe DeDiminicantanio, assistant superintendent at San 
Marcos Unified. 
What happens there, and in many other North County school districts, is that 
new housing developments are too expensive for most ethnic-minority families, 
who tend to live in the less-expensive downtowns. But the schools are built 
near the outlying tracts because that's where the school districts can get 
developers to give them land. 
The result, school officials concede, is 
that a disproportionate percentage of minority students are in older schools 
near low-cost housing in the "inner city" of the town, while the new schools 
are populated mostly by whites in outlying areas. 
Unlike the San Diego city schools, which use voluntary busing to achieve racial 
balance, North County school districts are not under court order to 
desegregate, so they don't get state funds for busing, officials point out. 
The county Office of Education projects that 11 North County school districts 
will be among the 12 fastest-growing districts in the county over the next 10 
years, and many of those districts expect much of that growth to be among 
Latino students. 
Many districts have policies that limit how far a school's racial balance can 
stray from the district average. Yet almost every district has at least one 
school that violates the policy, and districts claim they can do little about 
it. 
The policy at the Oceanside Unified School District, for example, is not to 
have any school fall 15 percentage points above or below the district-wide 
average, which, for elementary schools, is 56% ethnic minority. In other words, 
no school is supposed to draw less than 41% or more than 71% of its students 
from ethnic minorities. 
Five of the district's 15 elementary schools, however, fall outside those 
boundaries. 
At the Christa McAuliffe School, which opened in 1989, ethnic minorities make 
up 33.6% of the students, while, on the other end of the spectrum, 83.9% of the 
students at Ditmar School are nonwhite. 
"We have done everything we can do to maintain that ethnic balance throughout 
the district," said Supt. Steven Speach. "There have been several boundary 
changes in the past four or five years to try and maintain the ethnic balance." 
Oceanside follows the North County pattern of having its new schools in the 
areas where growth is projected -- and where school sites are available. 
In primarily Latino areas, which tend to be in already-developed parts of the 
city, there are few school sites available, Speach said. 
"The funding for school construction is very, very limited," Speach said. "We 
have two sources: development fees and the state building program. What we have 
done is, wherever there was a large development, we've gone in and negotiated 
with the developer and said, look, in lieu of fees, we'll take land. 
"And, well, you take land wherever you can get it." 
Similarly, at Carlsbad Unified, Aviara Oaks Elementary School plans to open in 
September on the outskirts of the district's boundaries with a projected 
ethnic-minority enrollment of 5% to 10%, and to push the ethnic-minority 
enrollment of neighboring Pine and Jefferson Elementary schools into the 60% to 
70% range. The district average is 27%. 
The cost of the houses being built in the attendance area of the new school is 
admittedly prohibitive to a large percentage of the ethnic minorities. 
"There won't be even anything available in the area (near Aviara Oaks) for 
Latinos to rent, not to mention buy," said Cheryl Ernst, assistant 
superintendent at Carlsbad Unified. 
Vista Unified School District's elementary schools have steadily become more 
segregated during the past five years. Santa Fe/California Elementary School in 
the center of town has the heaviest concentration of Latinos, blacks and Asians 
in the district. Its enrollment has steadily climbed from 51.7% ethnic-minority 
in 1986 to 64% in 1989. 
Meanwhile, Vista Unified's three newest elementary schools, Alamosa Park, Lake 
and Empresa, have the lowest concentrations of ethnic-minority students in the 
district, with 17.9%, 24.6% and 19.6% respectively in 1989. 
And the situation in Vista Unified is likely to become more unbalanced. 
Ron Riedberger, assistant superintendent of administrative services, said the 
minority population in the district climbs another percentage point or two 
every year. Now it is 36%, and he sees no end in the trend. 
"The Hispanic population is moving into the Santa Fe and Bobier Elementary 
School attendance areas," Riedberger said. "But, on the other hand, we know 
that the new schools that we've built in the last four years have taken away 
from schools like Bobier and Santa Fe some of their Anglo" students. 
In contrast, the newest San Marcos elementary school, Knob Hill Elementary, 
opened in 1988 with an ethnic-minority enrollment of 43%, slightly above the 
district average, and an elementary school scheduled to open in September will 
have a similar racial composition. 
"Our approach has been that, at least over the past four or five years, as we 
put new schools on line, we've tried to create attendance boundaries so that 
the student bodies in those new schools are pretty reflective of the average 
mix in our district," said Supt. Bernd. 
But San Marcos Elementary School, with 66% minority enrollment, sits in stark 
contrast to Woodland Park and La Costa Meadows Elementary schools, where the 
minority enrollments are 21% and 13%, respectively. 
San Marcos Elementary teacher Gutierrez characterized many of her school's 
students as at risk, coming from single-parent and transient homes where 
participation in school matters typically is lower than in more affluent areas. 
And the district, she complained, has done little to help. 
For example, Gutierrez said, San Marcos Elementary has had no playground 
equipment for the past school year until recently. 
"Why wasn't the problem of playground equipment dealt with immediately? These 
children need their exercise, and it was wrong to leave them without some sort 
of playground," Gutierrez said. "Would this have happened at La Costa Meadows? 
No way. 
"A lot of school board decisions made for this one school are really inadequate 
because they know that the parents at this school are disenfranchised because 
they don't have any voice," Gutierrez said. 
Members of the San Marcos Unified school board maintain that the education 
received at all of the schools is equal, but some parents argue that the high 
concentration of minority students makes it inherently unequal. 
"It's ludicrous for them to say that the schools are equal," said Donna 
Hernandez, a parent of two elementary school students and a member of the San 
Marcos group Citizens for a Better Board. 
"The societal problems at each school vary drastically when you have 26% white 
at one school and 87% at another," Hernandez said. "The board just has not been 
responsive when it comes to racial balance." 
Hernandez understands that integration cannot be achieved overnight, but she 
thinks that the district failed to seize an opportunity in its recent boundary 
adjustments to take steps toward integrating San Marcos Elementary. 
Bernd said that, to bring the ethnic-minority enrollment of San Marcos 
Elementary close to the district average, 2,400 students would have to be 
dislocated, three times the number that will already be dislocated in the 
opening of the new school. 
"We're not just dealing with ethnic balance in adjusting boundaries," Bernd 
said. "We're also dealing with school size, natural boundaries, safety 
considerations, transportation costs, and you have ethnic balance, and we 
looked at all of those factors when we drew the new boundaries." 
State laws do not require school districts to apply any hard-and-fast numbers 
to determine whether schools have become segregated, only that they "undertake 
reasonably feasible steps to alleviate" segregation, according to a 1976 state 
Supreme Court decision, said Christina Dyer, general counsel for San Diego City 
Schools. 
And, as a practical matter, some school officials said, the cost of English as 
a second language and bilingual programs makes it more cost-efficient for 
financially strapped school districts to group Latino students together, 
according to some school officials. 
"In some ways, it makes things a little bit easier because, if you have a 
higher concentration of minorities, you can concentrate your resources," San 
Marcos assistant superintendent DeDiminicantanio said. 
Dyer said she sympathizes with the North County school districts' situation. 
"Their growth needs are so tremendous up in North County," Dyer said. "If you 
don't have places for kids coming to school, first you've got to get a roof 
over their heads, then you start looking at, OK, now I've got them in a school, 
what's going on in the school, and then is it integrated?"
