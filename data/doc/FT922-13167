FT  14 APR 92 / MPs call for shift on renewable energy
THE GOVERNMENT should triple or quadruple its target for introducing
renewable energy such as wind, wave and solar power, according to a report
from MPs yesterday.
The Commons energy select committee suggested a target of between 3,000MW
and 4,000MW of renewable capacity, against the present target of 1,000MW by
the year 2000.
The government should consider the environmental benefits of renewable
energy when comparing it with alternative forms of energy, the report said.
It should act immediately to establish what the environmental costs of other
forms of generation are. Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, the
environmental pressure groups, welcomed the report. Renewable Energy Systems
and regional electricity companies SWEB and Manweb will build a 6MW windfarm
near Mitchell in Cornwall. The joint venture, Wind Resources, will spend
Pounds 6.5m developing the project, which will have wind turbines and is due
to start by the end of this year.
