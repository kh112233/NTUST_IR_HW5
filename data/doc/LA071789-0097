TYPHOON KILLS 23 IN PHILIPPINES 
Typhoon Gordon killed 23 people and made thousands homeless as it pummeled the 
northern Philippine island of Luzon causing floods and landslides, the Red 
Cross and police said today. 
A Red Cross spokeswoman said about 8,000 families were affected at the height 
of the typhoon, which had winds gusting up to 130 m.p.h. Sunday. She said many 
families were evacuated to schools and government offices after floods 
destroyed their homes.
