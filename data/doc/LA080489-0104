CBS IS A STRONG NO. 2 TO NBC IN EMMY NOMINATIONS 
CBS may have ended last season in third place, but its surprise hit, the 
Western miniseries "Lonesome Dove," not-so-surprisingly netted the most 
nominations Thursday for the 41st annual nighttime Emmy Awards, topping by one 
the most nominated show of the last two seasons, "L.A. Law." 
"Lonesome Dove," the critically acclaimed, eight-hour adaptation of Larry 
McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, garnered 18 nominations -- including 
one as best miniseries and others for stars Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Duvall, 
Diane Lane and Anjelica Huston. 
Its showing pushed CBS to a strong second place among the nomination leaders. 
Ratings king NBC, which has dominated the Emmy nominations for the last six 
years, collected 103 of the 364 nominations, with CBS getting 95 and ABC 85. 
PBS programs netted 32, and syndicated programs got 21 nominations. Fox 
Broadcasting shows got 12. Cable programs, which became eligible for nomination 
for the first time last year, received 16 nominations, only one more than last 
year. 
Suzanne de Passe, co-executive producer of "Lonesome Dove" and president of 
Motown Productions, said Thursday that when she got the 6 a.m. call from the 
Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences informing her of the 18 nominations, 
"I immediately burst into tears. 
"It's probably the most satisfying moment I think I've ever had. . . ," she 
said. "I'm so thrilled -- not just for the actors and what they call the major 
categories, but for our costumer, all of the people who really gave it all of 
that look, the photography, the music. For me as a producer and as part of the 
producing team, it really means we selected great people." 
De Passe added that the multiple nominations will not affect Motown's decision 
on whether to produce a sequel to what was the highest rated miniseries of the 
last five years. That depends, she said, on whether author McMurtry endorses 
it. "It's the only way I would be happy (doing a sequel)," she said. 
Last year's best series winners -- ABC's "thirtysomething" in drama and ABC's 
"The Wonder Years" in comedy -- were nominated in those categories again and 
also picked up more total nominations than in their first year on the air. 
"thirtysomething" got 13, compared to its 1988 total of 10, while "The Wonder 
Years," which received only two nominations in 1988 -- in the series and 
writing categories -- garnered 14 this time out. 
CBS newcomer "Murphy Brown," starring Candice Bergen as a hard-driving TV 
newswoman, became the most-nominated new series of last season with 11 
nominations. But the series faces stiff competition in the best comedy 
category: Other nominees include previous Emmy-winners "The Wonder Years," 
NBC's "Golden Girls" and NBC's "Cheers," along with CBS' "Designing Women." 
"We're thrilled, we're just thrilled," said Diane English, co-executive 
producer of "Murphy Brown" with husband Joel Shukovsky. "A part of me would 
like to be the kind of person who says, 'It means nothing; I don't care,' but 
let's be honest: This is pretty great -- especially since we're such a new 
show." 
English acknowledged that the thrill of being nominated is tempered by the 
waiting period between now and the Emmy Awards ceremony, which will be held 
Sept. 17 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
"Now is the part when it's not so much fun, where people try to involve you in 
that competition, and it really shouldn't be that," she said. "It would be 
great if it didn't come down to one winner, because the stuff that gets 
nominated is all so good. It would be great if it just ended here -- that these 
are the five best shows in each category." 
"Murphy Brown" has been only a marginal ratings success for CBS -- but ratings 
don't necessarily translate into Emmy nominations. The three top-rated series 
of last season received only six nominations among them -- four for ABC's 
"Roseanne" and one each for NBC's Thursday-night tandem of "The Cosby Show" and 
"A Diffent World" -- and none was nominated as best comedy series. 
The star of "Roseanne," former stand-up comedian Roseanne Barr, also failed to 
win nomination as best actress in a comedy series, although John Goodman, who 
plays her husband, was nominated as best actor. Also notably absent among the 
comedy nominees was John Larroquette of "Night Court," who has won the Emmy as 
best supporting actor for four years in a row. 
But while Barr was an entrant in the competition, Larroquette was not: The 
actor took advantage of a new Emmy rule that requires actors to enter 
themselves in the competition, as do producers, writers and entrants in all 
other categories. In previous years, the producers of the shows were allowed to 
enter their cast members in the acting categories. 
Larroquette said Thursday that he chose not to enter. "I think my thought 
process was that the generosity of the Academy toward me has been magnanimous, 
and I just felt that I didn't want to overstay my welcome," he said. "I don't 
think there was any real devious thought about it, such as, 'I've never lost 
and I don't want to lose now.' " 
Along with the "Murphy Brown" nomination as best comedy, CBS scored another 
coup in the best drama category with its second-season series "Wiseguy," the 
story of undercover agent Vinnie Terranova (Ken Wahl). Other best drama 
nominees were ABC's "China Beach," CBS' "Beauty and the Beast," NBC's "L.A. 
Law" and ABC's "thirtysomething." 
Wahl also found a place among the nominated lead actors in a drama series, 
along with Ron Perlman of "Beauty and the Beast," Edward Woodward of "The 
Equalizer," Carroll O'Connor of "In The Heat of the Night" and Michael Tucker 
of "L.A. Law." 
Lead actresses nominated in the drama category were Linda Hamilton of "Beauty 
and the Beast," Dana Delany of "China Beach," Susan Dey and Jill Eikenberry of 
"L.A. Law," and Angela Lansbury of "Murder, She Wrote." 
Several special programs and movies received multiple nominations. "My Name Is 
Bill W.," ABC's dramatization of the life of the man who started Alcoholics 
Anonymous, got 7, including an acting nomination for James Woods. NBC's 
controversial "Roe vs. Wade," the story of the landmark abortion case, got 6 
nominations, among them nods for outstanding lead actress in a miniseries or 
special for Holly Hunter and Amy Madigan. 
The PBS "Great Performances" installment "Dance In America: Gregory Hines Tap 
Dance in America" won five nominations; HBO's "Murderers Among Us: The Simon 
Wiesenthal Story" got three. 
On the late-night front, newcomer Arsenio Hall may not be beating competitors 
Johnny Carson and David Letterman in the ratings yet, but he got more Emmy 
nominations: "The Arsenio Hall Show" got three, and Carson and Letterman got 
only two.
