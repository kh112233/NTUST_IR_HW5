DEALING WITH SOCIOPOLITICAL WORLD CHANGES 
Your Dec. 18 World Report is a sad and frightening reading. Its emphasis on 
each ethnic, national and religious grouping arguing "my family" first is a 
basic human reaction, but forgotten is the past on how families survived. It 
took a sharing with family and neighbors to feed, clothe and house those who 
belonged to the greater "connecting" body, the tribe. And the tribes never 
lived in peace without making either war or an accommodation. Only the latter 
allowed growth and development. 
Gandhi said, "An eye for an eye can blind the world." Only the "torch" of 
liberty and freedom can end the groping in darkness that such blindness 
produces. 
Recently, we learned the Hubble telescope in space, in its limited way, was 
still able to peer 2 billion light years away to our beginning. That darkness 
exploded and created light. There is a lesson for us to ponder and accept. 
Light is needed for us to see each other, and accept the differences. 
I wondered, when I read what the Hubble telescope pictured, why is that we can 
peer only into the past. Is it possible that light years back in time blinds us 
to what may be existing at this very moment in our lives, in some distant 
future, and makes it impossible to focus on it? 
May we be guided by a future based on the mutuality of all that unites every 
difference into yet but one, for we are all basically the same in form and 
frame. 
The Hubble telescope also pictures darkness we cannot peer into, but may be the 
place where we disappear forever, never to escape to shine brightly in the 
firmament that surrounds us. 
In a world that now knows how to harness nuclear power, surely the question we 
have to answer, and can answer, is what light we will produce today for those 
in the distant future, who may be seeing, in the Hubble telescope they are 
using, today's past, and all that happens with each reading of the moment?
