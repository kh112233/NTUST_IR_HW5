VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE; 
BOARD TO SEE IF CITIES BACK SALES TAX BOOST 
The Ventura County Transportation Commission on Friday voted to ask the 
county's 10 cities if they would support placing a measure on the November 
ballot that would raise the sales tax a half-cent to help pay for local street 
construction and repairs. 
The proposed ballot measure must be approved by the county's 10 cities and the 
Board of Supervisors before it can be placed on the ballot in the fall, said 
Mary Travis, a county transportation official. 
The increased sales tax would generate an estimated $25 million per year for 
the next 20 years, Travis said. 
Transportation officials acknowledged that county voters might be reluctant to 
approve another tax increase after the passage of Proposition 111. That 
measure, approved Tuesday, will raise the gasoline tax by 5 cents a gallon 
statewide for one year beginning Aug. 1, then go up a penny a year for the next 
four years. 
But Travis said that because $2 billion of the new gas-tax funds will be 
distributed to those counties that can come up with matching funds, it would 
benefit residents to support the local sales tax increase. 
With the passage of Proposition 111, Ventura County is expected to receive $160 
million over the next 10 years for road construction. Travis said if the sales 
tax were increased, the county could get as much as $65 million more over the 
same period of time. CARLOS LOZANO
