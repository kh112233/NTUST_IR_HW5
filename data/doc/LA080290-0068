METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CHARGED IN $1-MILLION SCHEME TO FLEECE 
IRS 
A West Los Angeles man has been charged with filing false income tax returns 
using real people's names and Social Security numbers as part of a plan to 
fleece the IRS out of more than $1 million, U.S. Atty. 
Lourdes G. Baird said Wednesday. 
Frederic N. Flenner, 48, faces as much as 75 years in prison and $1.8 million 
in fines after his indictment on seven counts of filing false tax returns and 
eight counts of mail fraud, Baird said. 
Flenner, who could not be reached for comment, entered a plea of not guilty 
Monday before U.S. District Judge Harry L. Hupp. 
Prosecutors said Flenner created fictitious W-2 forms and sent them in with 
fraudulent tax returns.
