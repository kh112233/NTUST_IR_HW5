  [Text] Sources in the Belarusian government told Interfax 
that the country's military budget would be 692.4 Bn rubles in 
1994. 
  Valery Pavlov, Deputy State Secretary for National Security 
and Crime Fighting, thinks that "the Belarusian army will be 
short of funds for purchases of up-to-date weaponry and 
personnel training even though parliament met all Defense 
Ministry's requirements." 
  Belarus will need nearly $33 Mn, he said, to honor its 
commitments to the treaty on limitation of armed forces in 
Europe.
