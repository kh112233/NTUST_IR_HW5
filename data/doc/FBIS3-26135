  [Text] On 1 February, the Harbin Railway Transportation 
Intermediate Court sentenced to death two exceptionally serious 
murderers who stole a gun and killed persons. 
  On the evening of 31 May last year, (Ma Zhanxiang), (Sha 
Zhufu), and (Zheng Erli) sneaked into the office of the No. 2 
plant of the Harbin city vehicle company in order to attempt 
robbery. 
  (Gao Jinzou), a civil policeman of the railway goods yard 
police substation of the Harbin Railway Station, discovered 
these three suspicious-looking persons and prepared to take them 
back to the police substation for questionning. These three 
criminals robbed (Gao Jinzou) of his 54-caliber gun, and he died 
after being stabbed in 16 places. The three criminals took the 
gun and ran away. 
  In the first ruling on the case, the Harbin Railway 
Transportation Intermediate Court sentenced (Ma Zhanxiang) and 
(Zha Zhufu) to death. Being under-aged when he committed the 
crime, (Zheng Erli) was given a lighter sentence of life 
imprisonment. 
  Although the three criminals lodged appeals after the first 
ruling, the provincial higher court overruled the appeal in the 
second ruling so that the original judgment stands.
