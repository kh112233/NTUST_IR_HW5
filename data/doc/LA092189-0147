BOMB IN PARCEL KILLS BASQUE TOWN POSTMAN 
A postman was killed by a parcel bomb in the Basque town of Renteria on 
Wednesday, the third person killed by such a device in Spain this month. 
Police said both of the young postman's hands were blown off and he died on the 
spot. Several people were wounded by the blast which occurred when the postman 
was on his mail round. 
The provincial governor's office said it suspected that the bomb had been 
posted by the guerrilla group ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom). 
ETA has claimed responsibility for one of the letter bomb deaths. It warned 
that more letter bombs are on their way to prison officials to protest against 
the government's policy of moving jailed guerrillas from high security prisons 
to jails all over the country.
