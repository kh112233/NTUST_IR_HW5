CURRENT PAPERBACKS: WAITING FOR AN ARMY TO DIE THE TRAGEDY OF AGENT ORANGE BY 
FRED A. WILCOX (SEVEN LOCKS PRESS: $10.95) 
Fred Wilcox's scathing indictment of the reckless use of toxic herbicides 
during the Vietnam War and their devastating effects on the men who were 
exposed to them combines elements of Randy Shilts' "And the Band Played On" 
with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring." Wilcox discloses that the defoliants 
sprayed on more than 4.5 million acres of Southeast Asia were contaminated with 
dioxin, the most deadly man-made molecule in existence. (A fatal dose is 
measured in parts per billion.) 
Young soldiers who were contaminated with dioxin now allegedly suffer a hellish 
array of medical problems, including liver and neurological damage, elevated 
rates of cancers usually found only in older men, depression, and fathering 
children with severe, multiple birth defects. Wilcox also charges that the 
Veterans' Administration has deliberately failed to provide these men the 
treatment they so desperately need. 
An important book, simultaneously infuriating and depressing; but even if it 
provokes public outcry, treatment -- and justice -- will come too late for many 
Vietnam veterans.
