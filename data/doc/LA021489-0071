METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF; 
AIRPORT SECURITY STAFF TO BE INCREASED 
Airlines using Burbank Airport will increase security staffing for about 30 
minutes a night in response to a television news report that alleged that a 
loophole in security procedures could be used by a plane hijacker. 
In a report Monday night, KNBC-TV maintained that there was a dangerous 
security lapse because the screening stations, where metal detectors scan 
passengers for weapons, have been unstaffed after the last outgoing flight 
departed about 9:40 each night. 
People entering the terminal could then go to the boarding area without being 
screened to meet any of several flights that arrive before the airport ceases 
operations about 10 p.m. 
An airline security committee voted Monday afternoon to increase security after 
the station gave airport officials an advance look at its videotape. Metal 
detectors will be staffed until the last passenger has left the building, said 
Michael Kean, customer service manager for Alaska Airlines and chairman of the 
committee.
