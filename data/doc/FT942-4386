FT  10 JUN 94 / Price-fixing in plastics admitted
The US Justice Department said yesterday it had cracked a price-fixing
conspiracy among three plastic cutlery manufacturers that controlled over 90
per cent of the Dollars 100m-a-year US market.
Following joint raids by the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, the department charged that executives at
Minnesota-based Plastics Inc, Pennsylvania-based Polar Plastics and
Massachusetts-based Comet Products had agreed in secret telephone
conversations and meetings to drive up prices on disposable cups and glasses
from December 1991 to December 1992.
The three companies have all agreed to plead guilty and will collectively
pay over Dollars 8.36m (Pounds 5.57m) in fines. Four corporate executives
charged individually in the case also agreed to guilty pleas and face
potential imprisonment and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines under
US anti-trust and wire fraud laws.
'This is the kind of international co-operation that is urgently needed in
an age of shrinking borders and international anti-trust conspiracies,' Ms
Janet Reno, US attorney general, said of the combined US-Canadian raids that
led to the indictments.
The administration has been attempting to bolster anti-trust operations.
Two of the executives charged, Mr Robert Westbrook and Mr Warren White,
president and vice-president of Plastics Inc respectively, are accused of
defrauding Delta Airlines and Bunzl, both of which use large quantities of
plastic dinnerware.
