Grant Number DE-FG0194CE15546 to Corwin R. Horton. The proposed grant will provide funding in the estimated

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f) that the unsolicited application for
financial assistance submitted by Corwin R. Horton is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10
CFR 600.14(d) and the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial assistance
under a recent, current or planned solicitation. The market potential for this invention includes the recreational/pleasure
boat industry, which generated sales in 1992 of $10 billion (456,000 units). Exports generate a large portion of sales
for this industry. The growing ferry industry, U.S. Coast Guard and military represent other markets. The invention
should significantly improve fuel economy and handling, compared to existing hulls. By reducing drag (friction)
on a vessel's hull, the invention reduces energy consumption by an estimated 35 percent. The principal investigator
and inventor Dr. Harry Stanford has a patent on his invention and wide experience in developing the new technology.
The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation because
the funding program, the Energy Related Invention Program (ERIP), has been structured since its beginning in 1975
to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs ERIP to provide support
for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue a competitive solicitation.




The anticipated term of the proposed grant is 18 months from the date of award.





Issued in Washington, DC on May 19, 1994.
