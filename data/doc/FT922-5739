FT  29 MAY 92 / Hurd boosts Mexican links
MR Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, has concluded a three-day trip
to Mexico promising to make 'a deliberate and vigorous effort' to restore
the UK's 'historical relationship' with Latin America.
His visit - days before the visit of Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, to Brazil and Colombia - is intended to boost trade between the UK
and the region, and prepare the way for President Carlos Salinas's state
visit to the UK in July.
Mr Hurd pressed the Mexican authorities on the North American Free Trade
Agreement, urging that this not erect barriers to the outside world.
'It is rather important that British banks should not be discriminated
against in any serious way,' he said. Mr Hurd understood that Mexican
concessions offered to the US and Canada would be made to other countries
'in the reasonable future'.
The foreign secretary heaped praise on the economic reforms under way in
Latin America, and berated those in the UK who 'are still slow to understand
what is happening.' He described Mexico's reforms 'as a leading example of
what can be done by following sensible policies.'
Mr Hurd was less flattering about Mexico's path to democracy. 'President
Salinas is modernising Mexican democratic arrangements. I support this
process: I hope it will go further,' he said.
The foreign secretary visited Guadalajara, scene of the gas explosion that
killed more than 200 people last month, and announced a Pounds 100,000
contribution to the disaster relief fund.
AP reports from Washington: Mexico City is to have a Dollars 100m loan to
help tackle its pollution problem, the Inter-American Development Bank
announced.
