FT  27 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin producers agree to cut
exports
THE WORLD'S biggest tin producers have agreed a series of measures that they
hope will reduce global stocks and raise prices.
The Association of Tin Producing Countries, at the conclusion of a meeting
in Kuala Lumpur, said 1994 tin exports by member countries would be limited
to 78,000 tonnes - a 13 per cent reduction from the present annual exports
permitted under its quota regime.
The ATPC groups Malaysia, Indonesia, Nigeria, Thailand, Australia, Bolivia
and Zaire.
For the present China and Brazil, two of the world's biggest tin producers,
remain outside the association. But earlier this week the former country
agreed to join the ATPC by the end of the year. China's tin exports, which
are said by some ATPC delegates to have been as high as 30,000 tonnes last
year, are felt to be one of the main reasons for the slump in tin prices
over the past few years.
Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, said low tin
prices were also caused by increased sales of tin stocks by the US Defence
Logistics Agency. Tin prices in Malaysia, once the world's biggest producer,
dropped to a historic low of MDollars 10.78 (MDollars 4.22) a kilogram last
month, compared with MDollars 32 ten years ago.
'We hope the measures taken will induce an upward movement of prices from
the current ridiculously low levels,' said Mr Lim.
The association, while noting that tin prices had rallied somewhat in recent
weeks, said the most important task was to reduce the global tin stockpile,
at present estimated to be 40,000 tonnes. 'It is reasonable to expect a
meaningful depletion of around 10,400 tonnes in the stock level during 1994,
thereby reducing the total overhang to a more manageable 28,500 tonnes' said
the ATPC.
