FT  20 OCT 94 / Nasdaq price fixing inquiry
The US Justice Department confirmed yesterday it had launched an
investigation into allegations dealers on the Nasdaq stock market illegally
fixed their prices to profit at the expense of investors.
The investigation follows the publication earlier this year of two academic
studies which claimed to have found evidence Nasdaq dealers had secretly
agreed to keep spreads - the difference between the price at which they buy
and sell shares for investors - unnecessarily wide in order to maximise
their profits. Ater the studies the spreads on leading stocks were halved.
Nasdaq is the second largest stock market in the US after the New York Stock
Exchange, listing the shares of such well known companies as Apple Computer
and Microsoft, and under its system investors buy and sell stocks at prices
quoted to them by dealers.
The wider the spread between the buy and the sell price, the more money the
dealers make on each trade.
Since the studies were published earlier this year, more than a dozen
class-action lawsuits have been filed alleging that Nasdaq dealers - among
them some of Wall Street's biggest names - violated US anti-trust laws by
alleged price-fixing practices. Yesterday's announcement is the first sign
that the government is looking into the matter.
The National Association of Securities Dealers, which runs Nasdaq, said
yesterday that it had not been contacted by the Justice Department, and said
that it was 'standard procedure' for the department to follow up on
class-action lawsuits, which NASD described as 'baseless'.
