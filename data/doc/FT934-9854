FT  09 NOV 93 / Kent wants extra tunnels for Channel rail link
EXTRA TUNNELS and other route changes that would add Pounds 125m, or 5 per
cent, to the Pounds 2.5bn cost of the Channel tunnel rail link are proposed
in a Kent County Council report published yesterday.
The 90-page report will be put to a special meeting of the council on
Thursday and, if approved, will be submitted to the Department of Transport.
The department is considering a study by Union Rail, the company set up to
develop the high-speed rail link.
The Kent study confirms the county's support in principle for the 70-mile
link - 45 miles of which will be in the county - but calls for changes to
reduce its environmental impact. Mr Allan Mowatt, county director of
highways and transportation, said: 'This is not an enormous extra amount in
relation to the total sum of money to be spent.'
The report supports only half of the improvement proposals suggested by
local environmental and residents' groups, but could conflict with Union
Rail's desire to keep costly tunnelling to a minimum.
The three main proposed changes are:
A longer tunnel under the North Downs to spare an area of outstanding
natural beauty between Bluebell Hill and Detling at a cost of Pounds 60m.
The link to go through the centre of Ashford rather than to the north.
A small diversion to avoid building a shallow tunnel under housing at Pepper
Hill on the edge of Northfleet.
The report says the environment is one of 'six key tests' by which the
proposed link should be judged. It criticises the government on two -
environment and freight transport - but is happy with the proposals in terms
of passenger services, the economic impact on the county and the proposed
international rail links.
