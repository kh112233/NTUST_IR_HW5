  [Text] Bonn, Germany April 09 (A.A.) -- Turkish ambassador 
to Germany Onur Oymen said today that the friendly feelings of 
Turks are being damaged continuously by the German media. 
  Speaking at a "roundtable meeting" led by Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl and which aimed at preventing xenophobia, Oymen said that a 
number of German TV stations broadcast anti-Turkish programs. 
  Oymen said that 2 million Turks were living in this country 
and the programs against their homeland hurt their feelings. 
  "These broadcasts are one-sided and the same old archive 
films are shown again and again, hurting the pride of Turks," he 
said.
