Old Chicago: Al Capone has finally won his case. Unfortunately for the 
Prohibition-era gangster, his victory came only in a mock trial during an 
American Bar Assn. meeting in Chicago. 
Capone lost the trial that counted in 1931. Sunday's not guilty verdict came on 
two counts of failure to file tax returns and three counts of attempted income 
tax evasion. 
New Chicago: Former Mayor Jane Byrne may return from political retirement to 
challenge Mayor Richard Daley in his 1991 reelection bid, the Chicago Sun-Times 
reported Sunday. "I've been getting encouragement from throughout the city," 
Byrne told the paper. Daley's reaction? "Is she really running?" 
Big Money: Dethroned heavyweight champion Mike Tyson is the highest-paid 
athlete in the world with an estimated $28.6 million in income this year, 
according to Forbes magazine. Buster Douglas, little known until he upset Tyson 
for the heavyweight title in February, is second at $26 million, followed by 
another boxer, Sugar Ray Leonard, at $13 million. Next are auto racers Ayrton 
Senna at $10 million and Alain Prost at $9 million. 
Little Mark: Roll Call, Capitol Hill's insider newspaper, wants to do an 
article on tattooed members of Congress, says editor James K. Glassman, 
reviving memories of the tiger reportedly tattooed on the tail of former 
Secretary of State George Shultz. Anyone with skin art was encouraged to call 
in, and anyone who has seen some during those nude swims at the gym can turn in 
a colleague, "confidentiality assured," the paper said.
