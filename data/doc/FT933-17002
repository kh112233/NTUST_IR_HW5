FT  01 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Women given election boost
LABOUR yesterday approved plans for all-women shortlists for the selection
of candidates in half the constituencies where the sitting Labour MP is
retiring or where there is a good chance of defeating another party.
The decision by the National Executive Committee is part of Labour's
attempts to increase the number of women in parliament.
However Labour MPs last week threw out a proposal that they should vote for
at least four women in shadow cabinet elections, compared to the current
three.
