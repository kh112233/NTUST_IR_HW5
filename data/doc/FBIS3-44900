  [Text] Nearly two-thirds of all piracy last year took 
place in the South China Sea, particularly in the area between 
Hong Kong, the Philippines and Hainan Island, according to the 
annual report of the International Maritime Bureau (IMB). 
  Though the number of piracy attacks worldwide dropped from 
115 in 1992 to 103, there was an increase in reports of 
government authorised attacks, particularly prevalent by Chinese 
naval vessels. 
  Eric Ellen, director of the IMB said there was overwhelming 
evidence that the attacks had been carried out by Chinese naval 
vessels. 
  "We have photographs of the vessels, photographs of the 
crews' uniforms, and photographs of the flags being carried." 
  He said that only yesterday he had received notification of 
two more vessels attacked in the South China Sea. 
  The Hong Kong, Luzon and Hainan triangle was the biggest 
area 
of activity according to the report, where a total of 33 attacks 
were reported last year. 
  However, it remains unclear as to whether the attacks were 
officially sanctioned, or were being carried out by criminals 
appropriating the authority of Chinese state organisations. 
  It is believed by the IMB that there may be a link between 
the piracy and Chinese claims over the Spratly Islands, whose 
waters are disputed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan 
and Vietnam. 
  Nevertheless, the report also stated that incidents in the 
area had been reduced since August because of greater protection 
by the Russian authorities of their vessels, which had been the 
biggest victim of the attacks, with 27 last year.
