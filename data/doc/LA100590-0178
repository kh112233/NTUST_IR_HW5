WORLD; 
KLAUS GAINS POWER IN CARIBBEAN 
Tropical Storm Klaus gained strength off Antigua today and was upgraded to a 
hurricane after leaving six people dead and two missing in flooding on the 
Caribbean island of Martinique. 
The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Klaus had sustained winds of 80 
m.p.h. this morning, up from 60 m.p.h. earlier. 
It remained stalled 30 miles off Antigua but was expected to start moving 
again. 
It was uncertain whether Klaus, the sixth named hurricane of the season, would 
reach the United States. 
"We expect it in the next two or three days to move toward the northwest and to 
be north of Puerto Rico and east of the Bahamas. Beyond that, it's too early to 
say," the Hurricane Center said.
