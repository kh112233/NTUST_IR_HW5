  [Abstract] The proliferation of antibiotic resistant 
strains due to wide uses of antibiotics in infectious disease 
therapy and as fodder additives for agricultural livestock and 
the observed variability in the strains' resistance to 
chemotherapy preparations prompted an investigation into the 
stability of Vibrio comma isolated from the water of 
surface reservoirs in the Far East in Siberia in the past 15 
years to antibiotics. To this end, 1,383 El Tor strains isolated 
from 12 administrative regions (from Amur to Tyumen and from 
Yakutia Sakha to Buryatia) are tested for their resistance to 
eight antibiotics: ampicillin, streptomycin, monomycin, 
polymyxin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, and 
nalidixic acid. The findings do not display a common tendency 
toward increasing the resistance but confirm the observed 
variability, especially for Ap, Sm, Mn, and Pm. Of these, most 
strains are resistant to Pm, Ap, and Sm (up to 100% in 
some 
years) and the least number are resistant to Cm and Tc (0.4 and 
1.9%, respectively); in some cases a geographic 
correlation is 
established. In addition, a direct quantitative dependence of 
the resistance level on the minimum inhibitory concentration is 
revealed: the lower the the minimum inhibitory concentration, 
the fewer the number of resistant strains. The findings may be 
used for comparative retrospective analyses of the antibiotic 
resistance of Vibrio cholerae isolated in different 
regions and for solving certain epidemiological problems.
