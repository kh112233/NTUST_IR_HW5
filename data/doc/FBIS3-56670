  [Text] Moscow January 17 Tass -- Noted Lawyer Mikhail 
Mityukov from the Russia'a Choice Bloc was elected Monday first 
deputy speaker of the State Duma. 
  Aleksandr Vengerovskiy from the LDPR [Liberal Democratic 
Party of Russia], Alevtina Fedulova from the "Women of Russia" 
bloc and Valentin Kovalev were elected deputy speakers. 
  One post of a deputy speaker remained vacant. 
  Mityukov chaired the commission on legislature in the former 
Russian parliament and was sacked by former Speaker Ruslan 
Khasbulatov. 
  Speaking before the vote, Mityukov said he would work to 
ensure real parliamentarism in Russia. This can be achieved 
through an unconditional observance of the constitution and in 
close interaction with the president and the government, 
according to him.
