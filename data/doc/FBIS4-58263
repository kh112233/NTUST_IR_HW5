  [Excerpt] Counterfeit, 1990-issue [U.S.] $100 bills have 
recently found their way onto the Jordanian market, according to 
money changer sources. The counterfeit bills are said to be as 
near perfect as the originals; the imitations can stand the test 
of x-ray detectors. The paper used in the imitations is said to 
be remarkably similar to authentic bills. 
  Money changers are advising members of the general public 
against accepting 1990-issue $100 bills from suspect sources 
before subjecting it to thorough inspection. The counterfeit 
banknotes bear distinctive marks setting them apart from the 
genuine $100 bills. [passage omitted]
