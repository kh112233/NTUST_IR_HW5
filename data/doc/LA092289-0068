Palestinians stoned a bus carrying West German tourists through Bethlehem and 
injured two of them, the Israeli army said. The attack on the tourists was the 
second in two days by activists in the uprising in the occupied areas. Several 
West Germans were slightly hurt Wednesday night when their bus was stoned in 
Bethlehem. Tourists have become a target since Israeli troops disguised as 
tourists shot and killed an activist in Bethlehem last month.
