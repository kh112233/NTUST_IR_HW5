SALVATION ARMY FIGHTS MINIMUM WAGE ORDER 
The Salvation Army gives its clients "soup, soap and salvation," but the 
federal government says it isn't enough. 
The Labor Department claims that people to whom the Salvation Army ministers -- 
giving them room, board and up to about $20 a week for helping at the centers 
-- are employees who should be entitled to a minimum wage under the Fair Labor 
Standards Act. 
But Army officials said the payments could doom the centers and have said the 
company will not comply with the demand.
