ACTION: 

Proposed rule; withdrawal.



</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing its proposal to remove thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate
from the list of direct human food ingredients that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). FDA proposed to remove
these substances because it had not, at that time, received any reports that these substances were in use as direct
human food ingredients. The agency is withdrawing the proposal because of a report that these substances are being
directly used in food.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate are listed in 182.3109 and 182.3280 (21 CFR 182.3109
and 182.3280), as GRAS for direct food use as chemical preservatives at levels not exceeding 0.02 percent of the fat
or oil content. Thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate are listed in 181.24 (21 CFR 181.24) as
prior-sanctioned ingredients for use as antioxidants in food-packaging material, and are permitted for use as antioxidants
in 175.300 

Resinous and polymeric coatings

 (21 CFR 175.300). In addition, indirect use of thiodipropionic acid is listed in 178.2010 

Antioxidants and/or stabilizers for polymers

 (21 CFR 178.2010).


In the 

Federal Register

 of August 13, 1982 (47 FR 35240), FDA proposed to remove thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate from
the list of direct human food ingredients that are GRAS. FDA stated that it was proposing to take this action because
FDA had not, at that time, received any reports that these substances were in use as direct human food ingredients.
FDA received three comments in response to its proposal. All three comments opposed the removal of these substances
from the list of direct human food ingredients that are GRAS. One of the comments contained information on the direct
use of these ingredients in food. In addition, two of the comments expressed concern that removing these compounds
from the list of direct GRAS ingredients would cause confusion about the GRAS or prior-sanctioned status of these
substances for indirect uses. Finally, two of the comments stated that the fact that the agency had not received any
reports of these substances being used in food was not an adequate reason to remove them from the list of direct food
ingredients that are GRAS.
FDA has considered all of these comments. In view of the comment that these substances are being directly used in food,
we have concluded that the orginal basis for the agency's proposal to remove these substances from the GRAS list is
not valid. FDA also wishes to clarify that its proposal to remove these substances from the list of direct human food
ingredients that are GRAS would not have affected their allowed indirect uses under 175.300, 178.2010,
or 181.24, as suggested by two of the comments. 
Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 

et seq.

), the agency announces that it is withdrawing the proposal that it published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 13, 1982 (47 FR 35240), to remove thiodipropionic acid and dilauryl thiodipropionate from the list of direct
human food ingredients that are GRAS.
