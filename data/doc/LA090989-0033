SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
There were "numerous differences" between J. David &amp; Co. records and 
documents obtained from the brokerage house, said an Internal Revenue Service 
agent who testified Friday in the fraud and tax evasion trial of Nancy Hoover 
Hunter. 
Paul T. Perry, who compared the company's financial statements with documents 
seized after the collapse of J. David, said that actual trades were omitted, 
changed or added to records being maintained at the La Jolla investment house. 
Records that showed huge profits being made by J. David (Jerry) Dominelli were 
used by J. David salespeople to encourage people to become investors. Previous 
testimony in the trial indicated that Hunter provided information that led to 
the creation of the so-called performance records. 
Hunter is charged with 234 counts related to the giant Ponzi scheme at J. 
David, which defrauded about 1,200 people out of nearly $90 million when the 
well-known firm was forced into bankruptcy in February, 1984. 
Perry said that he analyzed a number of accounts overseen by Dominelli, and 
that most of them lost money over the course of a year, even though other 
records shown investors indicated the trading led to a substantial profit. 
Perry said an interbank account, which started with a $30,000 value and dealt 
with foreign currency, was reported to have made $28,024 over the year. 
However, his audit showed that the account actually lost more than $28,000, a 
difference of more than $56,000, Perry testified. 
This 1980 performance record omitted six losses, showed six losses as profits 
and contained trades that were actually made in another account, he said. 
Perry's testimony will continue when the trial resumes Tuesday in federal 
court.
