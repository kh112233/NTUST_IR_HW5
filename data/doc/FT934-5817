FT  27 NOV 93 / Property: In the steps of a king - There's a royal
connection to one of the exceptional houses on offer / Cadogan's Place
Grade I buildings number about 6,000 of the more than 440,000 buildings
listed in England. What is for sale among these buildings of exceptional
architectural or historical importance?
From the 15th century comes The Tudor Shops, a wool merchant's house in
Lavenham, Suffolk, which originally was probably a hall-house (meaning one
that started life as a medieval hall); Pounds 235,000 from Hamptons
(0284-767338).
In Somerset, Poundisford Park was built in 1546 on a typically Tudor H-plan
and still has its Tudor kitchen, built away from the house as a fire
precaution. Its park was enclosed in Saxon times, and King John hunted deer
there in 1208. Stags (0823-662822) invites offers over Pounds 600,000.
Two artists' houses from the 18th century in Hampstead, London, are offered
by Hamptons: George du Maurier's 28a Hampstead Grove opposite Fenton House
and next to Admiral's House in Hampstead village (Pounds 665,000), and
Romney's House in Holly Bush Hill. This was used as assembly rooms in the
19th century before becoming the local Constitutional Club.
Architect Clough Williams Ellis (of Portmeirion fame) converted it back to a
private house for his own use before the second world war, after it had been
assembly rooms in the 19th century and then the Hampstead Constitutional
Club. 'Substantial offers' are invited.
In Devon, Bowden House near Totnes is of Queen Anne and Tudor date. It is
also supposedly haunted, as are the six holiday cottages in the grounds.
Fulfords (0803-864112) is selling this handsome property for Pounds 995,000.
For grade I and 19th century living, 1 Brunswick Square at Hove, Sussex (the
quieter town next door to Brighton), is a classic Regency town house with a
double bowed front; from Hamptons (071-493-8222) for an attractive Pounds
270,000. The square, laid out in the 1820s, is as smart and sophisticated as
any of Nash's grade I London terraces round Regent's Park. In the capital, 5
Belgrave Square is a less ornate building on the north, sunny side of the
square, a speculative leasehold development built by Thomas Cubitt as a
speculative leasehold development on the Grosvenor estate in 1830.
A new, 40-year lease for this desirable address, with a ground rent of
Pounds 5,000 (reviewable in 2013), costs Pounds 3.25m from Aylesford
(071-351-2383) or George Trollope (071-824-8111). A mews is included.
Grade I is also for rent. Clenston Manor near Blandford Forum, Dorset, is
available from January for three years as an assured shorthold, with the
possibility of two more years being available.
The rent is negotiable at around Pounds 25,000 a year, through Savills
(0202-887731 or 0722-320422). The house is Tudor, of knapped flint banded
with green sandstone, but goes back to the 13th century. It has never been
sold.
