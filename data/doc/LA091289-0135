COURT DENIES BAIL FOR COLOMBIA DRUG SUSPECT 
Accused Colombian drug financier Eduardo Martinez Romero was ordered jailed 
without bail Monday after he pleaded innocent to charges of laundering huge 
sums of cocaine money that led to his extradition to the United States. 
U.S. Magistrate Joel M. Feldman, in denying a request that Martinez be held 
under house arrest rather than his current solitary confinement, ruled that 
defense lawyers failed to answer government arguments that he could resume 
supervising money laundering for the Medellin drug cartel and should be 
regarded as dangerous. 
Martinez is the first accused Colombian drug figure extradited to the United 
States since his country's anti-drug crackdown began more than three weeks ago. 
Although the defendant had never been charged with a crime, was a government 
budget director and is a family man, Feldman emphasized that money laundering 
"oils the machine" of drug distribution and is more serious than a mere series 
of alleged illegal financial transactions. 
The 36-year-old Martinez is accused of laundering at least $15 million in U.S. 
banks and of being the financial expert behind efforts to hide $1.2 billion in 
drug profits earned by the Medellin cartel, which is believed responsible for 
80% of the cocaine smuggled into this country. 
Martinez was extradited from Colombia under heavy guard last Thursday. His 
lawyer had objected that a U.S. court has no jurisdiction over him. 
Martinez could receive life in prison under U.S. law, compared to 30 years 
under Colombian law.
