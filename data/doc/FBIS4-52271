  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam on 
Monday cabled felicitations to President-elect Nelson Mandela of 
South Africa on his victory in the recent presidential election. 
  In the message, President Kim said he was paying respect to 
the president-elect for his distinguished leadership in bringing 
about a democratic government by abolishing apartheid through 
South Africa's first multi-racial free election. 
  "Your Excellency's unswerving struggle for democracy 
culminated in such brilliant achievements which, I believe, will 
also be very much conducive to the efforts for democratization 
in other African nations," the message said.
