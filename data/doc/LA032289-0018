'VIRUS-LIKE AGENT' MAY BE NEW CLUE TO CAUSE OF AIDS 
A mysterious "virus-like agent" detected in AIDS patients has been described in 
detail by a team of federal researchers, who suggest that their findings may 
challenge prevailing wisdom on what causes AIDS. 
The researchers, at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the National 
Institutes of Health, said the agent may represent a new infection striking 
people with damaged immune systems, or may play "a more fundamental role as a 
co-factor" in triggering AIDS. 
"Our . . . data is too meager to make this distinction, but we have 
unequivocally demonstrated the existence of a previously unrecognized 
virus-like infectious agent in patients with AIDS," they reported in the most 
recent issue of the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. 
Virologists and other AIDS researchers reacted with caution to the findings, a 
follow-up to a brief, preliminary account by the researchers in 1986. 
Scientists on Tuesday described the more detailed results as provocative but 
not necessarily conclusive. 
They pointed out that the findings have yet to be confirmed by other 
researchers -- a crucial test of the credibility of a piece of research. Some 
also cited what they described as limitations in the federal researchers' 
methods and data. 
All said they were withholding judgment on the significance of the report. 
"I think it's very interesting, I think it deserves more attention," said 
Norbert Rapoza, a virologist and senior scientist with the American Medical 
Assn. who has followed the research. "I think it has to be looked at more 
closely." 
Most leading researchers believe that AIDS is caused by the human 
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. The virus is thought to gradually destroy a 
person's immune system, leaving the person vulnerable to a range of infections 
that are eventually lethal. 
Some AIDS activists and a few scientists challenge that explanation, contending 
that AIDS may result from a combination of forces or another virus. AIDS 
activists who hold that view welcomed the newly published report on Tuesday, 
saying that it supports their suspicions. 
The federal researchers, headed by Shyh-Ching Lo of the Armed Forces Institute, 
originally identified the new virus-like infectious agent, called VLIA, in a 
single patient with Kaposi's sarcoma, a form of cancer that affects some AIDS 
patients. 
Using a series of sophisticated laboratory techniques, the scientists 
determined that the agent could infect cells. Through analysis, they also 
concluded that it was distinct from numerous other viruses, some of which have 
also been suspected of being co-factors in causing AIDS. 
They then examined DNA isolated from various organs in 10 people with AIDS; in 
seven, they found pieces of DNA apparently similar to that of the virus-like 
agent. When they examined DNA from people without AIDS, they found no such 
similarities. 
"Our findings suggest that VLIA may represent a new opportunistic infection in 
these severely (debilitated) patients, or an agent which plays a more 
fundamental role as a co-factor in the process associated with infection by 
HIV," the researchers reported. 
Through intermediaries, Lo declined Tuesday to discuss his findings. 
The journal in which the report appeared this month is published by the 
American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Virologists described the 
journal, mailed monthly to 3,600 specialists, as a respected forum for issues 
concerning tropical medicine. 
All reports must be reviewed and approved in advance by experts in the field. 
Virologists contacted Tuesday declined to speculate on the significance of Lo's 
findings. Some also declined to be quoted by name on the subject. They said the 
viral agent could prove to be anything from a contributing cause of AIDS to 
nothing more than a contaminant. 
"I'm convinced that the agent does exist," said Rapoza, who said he has 
followed Lo's work for 18 months. "I don't think he's faking it. He has 
something; he has a virus. The question is, where did it come from?" 
Another prominent virologist said "it would be nice" to see additional evidence 
-- for example, confirmation by other researchers, a good electron microscopic 
picture of the agent and more proof that the agent is common in AIDS patients. 
Meanwhile, in separate work, U.S. scientists announced Tuesday that they have 
successfully modified the AIDS drug AZT in the hope of making it more potent in 
counteracting HIV and reducing its side-effects, such as anemia and bone marrow 
disorders. 
Dr. Sudhir Gogu of Tulane University School of Medicine announced the 
development of so-called DP-AZT at a meeting of the Federation of American 
Societies for Experimental Biology in New Orleans. He reported "promising 
results" in mice cells. 
AZT, also known as retrovir or zidovudine, is the only approved treatment for 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome on the U.S. market. Although not a cure, 
the drug can prolong the lives of AIDS victims by slowing the spread of 
infection from cell to cell.
