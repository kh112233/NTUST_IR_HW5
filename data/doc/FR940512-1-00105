(f)*** 
(1) The requirements of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 48214846) and implementing
regulations at part 35 of this title (except as superseded in paragraph (f)(2) of this section) apply to the dwellings
(except zero-bedroom dwelling units) in housing assisted under this subpart that was constructed or substantially
rehabilitated before 1978 and in which any child less than six years of age resides or is expected to reside. (2)(i)***
This paragraph (f)(2)(i) is promulgated under 35.24(b)(6) of this title and supersedes, with respect to the
program, the requirements prescribed in part 35, subpart C, of this title. 
(ii) The following definitions apply to paragraph (f) of this section: 


Chewable surface

 means any intact protruding painted surface up to five feet from the floor or ground that is readily accessible to children
less than six years of age (e.g., protruding corners, windowsills and frames, doors and frames, and other protruding
woodwork). 


Defective paint surface

 means the same as the term is defined in 35.22 of this title. 


Elevated blood lead level or EBL

 means the same as the term is defined in 35.3 of this title. 


* * * * * 


(iii)*** Defective paint surfaces either must be tested for lead content or, if defective
paint surfaces are not tested, the presence of lead-based paint shall be assumed and the surfaces abated in accordance
with 35.24(b) of this


title. *** 


(iv) In the case of a structure constructed or substantially rehabilitated before 1978, if the Borrower is presented
with test results that indicate that a child under the age of six years occupies the structure and has an elevated blood
lead level (EBL), the Borrower must cause the unit to be tested for lead-based paint on chewable surfaces. Testing
must be conducted by a State or local health or housing agency, by an inspector certified or regulated by a State or local
health or housing agency, or by an organization recognized by HUD. Lead content shall be tested by using an X-ray fluorescence
analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of 1 mg/cm

2

 or higher using an XRF shall be considered positive for the presence of lead-based paint. If the laboratory reports
the results in percent by weight 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million (ppm) is the standard. When lead-based paint
on chewable surfaces is identified, covering or removal of the paint surface in accordance with 35.24(b)(4)
of this title is required. 
(v) When abatement will result from rehabilitation activities planned (i.e., when all defective paint or chewable
surfaces will be replaced, covered, or otherwise abated as described in this part), these surfaces need not be tested.

(vi) In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section, at its discretion the Borrower may
abate all interior and exterior chewable surfaces in accordance with the methods set out in 35.24(b)(4) of
this title.
