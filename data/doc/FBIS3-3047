  [Text] Yichang, March 4 (XINHUA) -- Some 119 Chinese 
experts in water resources and hydro-electric power recently 
gathered at Yichang, in central China's Hubei Province, where 
the Three Gorges dam will be built, to further discuss the 
project's technical design. 
  The project is now at the preparatory stage and the 
construction of the main project will soon be started. 
  To decrease risks, shorten construction period and save 
costs, the Three Gorges project construction committee of the 
State Council has authorized the China Chang Jiang Three Gorges 
Development Corporation to take charge of the examination of the 
technical design. 
  To fulfill the task, the corporation has set up a technical 
committee and eight expert groups which will thoroughly examine 
eight major topics, including the dam, the power plant houses, a 
permanent floodgate, a ship lift, a deepwater coffer dam, sand 
and mud at the dam area and generation installation. 
  Foreign institutions and experts will be invited for 
consultation if necessary, according to Lu Youmei, general 
manager of the corporation. 
  Discussion of the site and the preliminary design have taken 
several decades and Chinese experts concluded after lengthy 
study that China definitely has the ability to solve major 
technical problems. 
  Soon ten symposiums will be held on technical issues 
concerning the project and some major technical issues will be 
deeply discussed. 
  From now on the technical committee will start an overall 
examination of the general layout, the design principle, major 
and key indices of every single project.
