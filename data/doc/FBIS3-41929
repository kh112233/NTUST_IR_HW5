  [Text] Moscow, RIA -- The contract for supplies of rocket 
engines and technology from Russia to India, concluded in 1991 
between the commercial company Glavkosmos and the Indian Space 
Research Organisation [ISRO], may be saved, a Glavkosmos 
official, asking not to be identified, suggested in an interview 
with a RIA correspondent. 
  The fulfilment of the 2.250 million rupees contract was 
suspended after the United States accused Russia of violating 
the regime of control over the transfer of rocket technologies. 
In the opinion of the American side, India could use the 
Russian engines for launching its ballistic missiles. 
  In December 1993 a delegation of Glavkosmos held talks with 
the representatives of ISRO, during which a new version of the 
agreement was worked out. It has been sent for approval to the 
Russian Government. In the opinion of Glavkosmos experts, there 
is now hope that this version will be approved because ``both 
politically and economically it is advantageous to Russia and 
does not violate the terms of the control regime.'' 
  Glavkosmos has already received over 1 billion rupees from 
the ISRO and is planning on account of the remaining part of the 
contract to transfer to India two take-off rocket blocks and 
equipment for their operation. India, in turn, guarantees 
Glavkosmos specialists access to the places of assembly, testing 
and launching of its rockets with mounted Russian engines.
