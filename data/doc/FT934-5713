FT  29 NOV 93 / DTI faces Scott inquiry grilling
The Department of Trade and Industry is bracing itself for some
unprecedented public scrutiny of its export control regime when the Scott
arms-for-Iraq inquiry hearings resume today after a two-week adjournment,
Jimmy Burns writes.
Lord Justice Scott and his counsel, Miss Presiley Baxendale QC, plan to
question senior DTI officials about statements they made to Customs and
Excise which led to the prosecution last year of three executives of the
machine-tool manufacturer Matrix Churchill for breaching export regulations.
The focus on the DTI is being greeted with some relief by the Foreign
Office, which considers itself to have unfairly borne the brunt of public
examination by the inquiry.
Appearing today will be Mr Eric Beston, the head of the DTI's overseas
branch responsible for export controls and licensing from 1985-1990.
He will be followed over the next two weeks by Mr Michael Petter, former
head of the DTI's Middle East exports branch and at present an assessor for
the Queen's Awards to Industry, and two other senior DTI officials, Mr
Anthony Steadman and Mr Michael Coolican.
The DTI will come under pressure to explain why it gave witness statements
to Customs and Excise claiming that officials had no idea that machine tools
being exported by the UK were used by the Iraqis for munitions manufacture.
