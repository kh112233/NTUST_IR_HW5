FT  13 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Skanska in Colombian contract
Skanska, Scandinavia's largest construction group, has finally secured a
Dollars 240m contract to build a hydroelectric power plant in Colombia, nine
years after first signing a contract for the work, Christopher Brown-Humes
reports from Stockholm.
A group of banks in the Nordic countries, Canada, Venezuela and Colombia are
putting up the funding for the project, which has mainly been hampered by
financing difficulties. Skanska's share of the project is 80 per cent.
The plant, which will have an installed capacity of 340MW and annual
production of 1,420 GWh, is to be built in Cordoba province near the
Caribbean in northern Colombia. Construction work is scheduled to start in
September and take six years.
Skanska will be working alongside the Colombian contracting company
Conciviles on the civil works and will be assisted with services and
purchasing by the Foundation Company of Canada.
