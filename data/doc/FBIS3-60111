Exposed in Switzerland"] 
  [Excerpt] Freiburg, 10 January -- A large-scale 
international drug ring, which sold several kilograms of heroin 
and cocaine, was exposed in Switzerland. Freiburg police 
reported on Monday [10 January] that more than 100 persons were 
arrested in several cantons and are now helping police with 
inquiries. The investigations have been coordinated by the 
Addictive Drugs Section of the Federal Public Prosecutor. 
  The investigations have been going on for 17 months. They 
began with monitoring a Nigerian drug dealer who "directed" a 
branch of the huge international trafficking ring from Freiburg. 
He lived in a hotel and carried out his activities under a 
false name. The man was arrested, together with two other 
persons, in April 1993. He alone will have to stand trial for 
selling more than 20 kilograms of heroin and cocaine.
