FT  02 SEP 94 / Basques want to follow Northern Ireland lead on peace talks
Herri Batasuna, the radical Basque nationalist coalition that supports Eta's
separatist gunmen and has close links with Ireland's Sinn Fein, yesterday
called on the Spanish government to imitate the example of the British
cabinet by recognising the political nature of violence in the Basque
country, writes Tom Burns. 'The logic of the (John) Major government is in
direct contrast to the closed and hostile position of the Spanish government
which, in the words of (interior and justice minister Juan Alberto) Belloch,
has only yesterday rejected all avenues towards an understanding and called,
once more, for repression,' the Basque coalition said in a statement. The
Basques described the developments in Ireland as 'common sense'.
