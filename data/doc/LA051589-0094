LOCAL; 
3 O.C. OFFICERS SLAIN IN '88 HONORED 
Police from throughout Orange County this morning solemnly dedicated plaques to 
the memory of three officers killed in the line of duty in 1988. 
The plaques were added to the Orange County Peace Officers Memorial in the 
Plaza of the Flags at the Santa Ana Civic Center. The memorial honors police 
and sheriff's deputies who have died while performing their work. 
The three new plaques bring to 28 the number of officers commemorated by the 
memorial. The new plaques honor Seal Beach Police Officer Edward Clavell Jr., 
Anaheim Police Officer Robert Roulston and Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Mark 
Tonkin. All died in the line of duty during the last year.
