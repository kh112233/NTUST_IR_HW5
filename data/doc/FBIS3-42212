  [Excerpt] Algiers, Feb 2 (AFP) -- Suspected Moslem 
fundamentalists have assassinated an activist in Algeria's 
Attahadi (Challenge) political party, Mohamed Touali, the party 
announced in a statement Wednesday. 
  Touali, 32, was kidnapped overnight Tuesday and his body was 
subsequently discovered, the party said. 
  He was the second member of Attahadi and the fourth 
political 
activist to be slain by suspected Islamic extremists since the 
January 27 murder of another official in the party, Ferhat 
Chibout. 
  The statement did not specify where Touali lived nor where 
the body was found. He was an employee of a state-owned company 
in the eastern town of Constantine. 
  His murder followed the killing Tuesday in the Casbah 
district of Algiers of French journalist Olivier Quemeneur and 
the wounding by gunmen of the cameraman's Australian colleague, 
Scott Allan White. 
  On Wednesday, White was at the Ain Nadja military hospital 
in 
a suburb of the capital, in very serious condition. [passage
