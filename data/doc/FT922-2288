FT  18 JUN 92 / Agreement on Prague government
RIVAL Czech and Slovak leaders reached basic agreement yesterday on forming
a new government, but remained deadlocked on how to prevent Czechoslovakia
splitting apart, Reuter reports from Prague.
'The short-term goal is to assure the functioning of the federal government
as soon as possible, and we've agreed on its basic structure,' said Mr
Vaclav Klaus, finance minister, after talks with Mr Vladimir Meciar, the
Slovak leader.
Neither Mr Klaus nor Mr Meciar, head of the Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia (HZDS), which wants to transform Czechoslovakia into a loose
confederation of two sovereign republics, named ministers in the new
government.
But Mr Klaus, chairman of the Civic Democratic Party, said he would stand
for the post of premier of the Czech republic, rather than become federal
prime minister. 'We do not put much faith in the functioning nature of the
state we are now constructing,' he said.
Mr Meciar said the new government had to function as a confederal body, with
most powers residing in the two individual republics, which he wants to have
their own independent international status.
