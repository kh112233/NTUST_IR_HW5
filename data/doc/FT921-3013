FT  17 MAR 92 / Letter: Where power lies in business
Sir, I would like to add a few thoughts to Christopher Lorenz's article 'Sum
total adds up to more than figures' (March 6) and Peter McGregor's letter
(March 9). One has to ask how accountants have achieved their power within
the UK business world. This I believe can be traced to the importance of the
stock market in corporate ownership, with power delegated to senior
managers. The accountant in this scenario acts as a policeman working on
behalf of the owners. Having realised this situation the accountants have
then organised the best closed shop.
If we consider the long-term as practised in Germany and Japan we find
ownership more closely involved in management and able to see financial
conditions for itself. Under this arrangement creativity and evolutionary
product design come to the fore. Interestingly, creativity as represented by
intuition and measured by psychometric assessment is found more among
scientists than accountants.
I write as one educated as a scientist who chose a business career, passed
through business school and later looked after the financial affairs of a
group of companies.
