CONFRONTATION AT TUSTIN'S ABORTION CLINIC 
It was heartening to be part of the Pro-Choice Majority at the Tustin Clinic on 
July 8. I was, however, dismayed to read in The Times that "each group declared 
it was the victor." The true victors were the patients who successfully 
obtained the health care they sought, thanks to the support of those of us who 
don't believe that religion should dictate our laws. 
I was also confused when I read in The Times that the "Tustin demonstration was 
largely nonviolent." I was there, and I saw people being pushed and shoved in a 
very violent manner. I was there and saw one woman jabbed so hard in the 
stomach that she couldn't catch her breath -- just one of many instances of 
violence initiated by anti-choice demonstrators. 
I commend the Tustin clinic personnel who, despite their busy schedule that 
day, took those injured people into the clinic and tended them. Please don't 
perpetuate the myth that Operation Rescue people are nonviolent. I've seen them 
for the fanatic, violent group they are because I was there.
