FT  29 JAN 94 / Channel freight terminal approved
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has given conditional planning
permission for the biggest Channel tunnel freight terminal, distribution and
manufacturing business park proposed in the Midlands.
The condition is that the developer arranges road access from the site to
the motorway network.
The interim decision announced yesterday, which follows a public inquiry in
late 1992 and early 1993, concerns nearly 600 acres of redundant
power-station land at Hams Hall, near Coleshill, Warwickshire. The land,
beside the planned Birmingham northern relief road, is owned by PowerGen,
the electricity generator. It will be developed by Trafalgar House Business
Parks.
