  [Excerpt] Beijing, Feb 4 (AFP)--China has released three 
dissidents who were jailed after the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement, a U.S. human rights activist said Friday. 
  John Kamm, a U.S. businessman and human-rights campaigner, 
said he was told by the Chinese government that the three had 
been released. The three are Xiao Bin, a worker from Liaoning, 
Liao Yiwu, a leading poet from Sichuan province, and Ding Junze 
(eds correct), former assistant professor of philosophy at 
Shanxi University, Kamm said in a statement received here. 
  The justice ministry, questioned Friday, said it had "no 
news" about any such release. 
  Xiao was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on June 10, 
1989 
on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement. 
He was arrested after giving numerous interviews to foreign 
correspondents, including an interview broadcast by ABC News in 
which he reported having witnessed many students killed in the 
military crackdown on June 4. Xiao, whose 10-year sentence was 
reduced by six months in December 1991, was paroled for good 
behaviour on Wednesday. 
  Liao had been sentenced to four years in jail in March 1990 
for counter-revolutionary incitement. He was released on Monday 
[31 January], two months ahead of scheduled, for good behaviour, 
by a court in Sichuan. Ding, jailed for 10 years in June 1989, 
was also released on January 31 on medical grounds. Aged 52, he 
has been suffering from spine problems and a heart condition, 
Kamm said. 
  Kamm, who is based in Hong Kong, had predicted on January 22 
that three dissidents would be released before the Lunar New 
Year, on Febuary 10. Kamm said he had made enquiries about 
other dissidents arrested after the bloody crackdown in 
Tiananmen Square, including Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao, who are 
serving 13-year terms, but he did not get a definite reply.
