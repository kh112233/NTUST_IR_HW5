FT  07 MAY 93 / Britain extends S Georgia waters
BRITAIN is to extend from 12 to 200 miles its territorial waters around
South Georgia and the South Sandwich islands, neighbours of the Falklands in
the South Atlantic, because of concern about over-fishing, the British
Foreign Office said yesterday.
Senior officials in Argentina said last night it would protest at the move,
once formal notification had arrived from London. Argentina has long claimed
the two more distant archipelagoes, as well as the Falklands themselves.
It was Britain's expulsion of a team of Argentine workers from a whaling
station on South Georgia that triggered the Argentine invasion in 1982,
leading to the Falklands war.
Warned of the British move, Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentine deputy foreign
minister, had said earlier: 'Argentina does not agree and nor does it seem
constructive to us.'
Announcing the move in London, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office
minister, said that there was a need to reinforce conservation arrangements
in the area. Chile, Russia and Japan are among the nations fishing in these
waters.
The anxieties about fish conservation had been discussed with the Argentine
government, 'with whom we have extensive exchanges on South Atlantic
matters', and ministers looked forward to pursuing this dialogue, he said.
The Foreign Office said that the UK government did not believe the extension
of jurisdiction to be provocative. Argentina had been consulted because of
its claim (disputed by the UK) to sovereignty over the islands, not because
Argentine boats were seen as mainly responsible for over-fishing.
The foreign office also emphasised that no rules had yet been made under the
extended jurisdiction, and that the proclamation to be made today simply
gave the UK the right to make rules.
