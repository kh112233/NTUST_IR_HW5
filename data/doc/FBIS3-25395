  [Text] Freetown, 16 Feb (AFP) -- Thirty-eight civilians 
were killed on the morning of 15 February during an attack by 
United Revolutionary Front [RUF] rebels in the Pujehun Region 
(210 km southeast of Freetown), according to reports by local 
journalists contacted by telephone from Freetown. 
  The reports stated that the rebels attacked the village of 
Bandasuma shortly before dawn, killing 38 persons before they 
were repelled by government soldiers, who killed 18 of the 
assailants and took eight prisoner after nearly two hours of 
fighting. 
  At the end of January, Sierra Leonean authorities declared 
"total war" against RUF rebels, who have been fighting in 
eastern Sierra Leone for the past two years.
