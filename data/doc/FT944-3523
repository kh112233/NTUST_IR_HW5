FT  13 DEC 94 / Technology: Drugs to tackle infections
Some microscopic bacteria and viruses are carcinogenic. Infections may
account for 10-15 per cent of all cancers, according to epidemiologists at
the Imperial Cancer Research Fund.
Five kinds of germ have been identified as possible cancer triggers:
Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium which survives in the stomach. It
irritates the stomach lining which may respond with ulcers or cancer.
Epstein-Barr virus is associated with Burkitt's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal
carcinoma, cancers more common in central Africa and China respectively than
in the west. EBV may be linked to cancer in people with suppressed immune
systems, perhaps after an organ transplant.
Human Papilloma virus (HPV) causes genital warts. Some sub-types have been
linked to cervical and vaginal cancers.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) survives for long periods in about 10 per cent of
the population, who are then at increased risk from liver disease, including
cancer.
Human T-cell Lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) have been implicated in leukaemia
in some populations such as Japan.
In principle, antibiotics and vaccines can beat these infections.
There are several hepatitis B vaccines on the market. Biotechnology
companies, including Isis in the US and Cantab in the UK, and the UK's
Cancer Research Campaign, are developing better HBV vaccines. The CRC says
its vaccine might even help patients already with cancer. Work is being done
too on broad spectrum antiviral drugs. California's Gilead has a material
which shows promise against EBV and HPV. And an industry is growing up
around H pylori. Diagnostics companies are launching saliva tests to replace
blood or tissue analysis, and Swedish drug company Astra this year won UK
approval for an antibiotic-based ulcer treatment.
