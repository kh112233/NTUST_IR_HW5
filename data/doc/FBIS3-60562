  AIDS -- More than 600 AIDS cases have been reported in

  Tropical Neuropathy -- ``More than 300 cases of tropical 
neuropathy were recently reported in Mongincual District,

NAMIBIA 
  Polio -- A minor outbreak of polio has occurred in Namibia 
with eight confirmed cases of the disease, currently restricted 
to the southern half of the country, the South African National 
Health Department said on 24 November. It said South Africans 
travelling to Namibia were advised to ensure polio immunisation 
of children under five years was up to date. The Namibian 
Health Ministry had launched a mass immunisation campaign to 
halt the spread of polio, an infectious viral disease which can 
result in paralysis of groups of muscles. The last polio 
epidemic in South Africa occurred in 1988 in Natal/kwaZulu, with 
the last case reported in 1990. (Johannesburg SAPA in English

<H5>  South Africa </H5>
  Typhoid -- An outbreak of typhoid fever has caused a health 
scare in the Botileng township outside Delmas. Since Friday, 
nearly 500 people with symptoms of the deadly disease have been 
treated. Although it is still not known whether all the cases 
are typhoid-related, 21 patients have been tested positive for 
the disease. All the people treated have shown tell-tale 
symptoms of the disease, which include severe headaches, stomach 
cramps, vomiting, and dehydration. The Delmas town council was 
unable to treat the large number of patients in local hospitals, 
so the South African Defense Force was called in. A make-shift 
hospital was equipped in an old hangar near the township. 
Between 300 and 350 people have since been transferred to 
hospitals in the Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging area, some 
as far afield as Hillbrow. No deaths related to the disease 
have been confirmed. (Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in English

  Further on Typhoid -- The toll in the Delmas typhoid 
epidemic 
has risen to six, while 307 people arer still being treated in 
hospital, the Transvaal Provincial Administration said on 
Friday. A sixth person died of the disease on Thursday night. 
One of the new admissions to the Far East Rand Hospital was a 
white angler from Springs, who had been fishing in the Delmas 
area, the statement said. The source of infection was still not 
known. The statement stressed that all people visiting the 
Delmas district were entering a ``high risk area'' and that it 
was important to take sufficient precautionary measures. A 
total of 177 patients were still being treated in provincial 
hospitals, 123 in the field hospital, four in the Heidelberg 
hospital and three in the Boksburg-Benoni hospital. A joint 
epidemiological survey by the Universities of Pretoria and the 
Witwatersrand commenced on Thursday. (Johannesburg SAPA in
