FT  28 AUG 92 / Technology: Paint by number - Researchers have found a
simple method of detecting disease
A rapid new technique for showing up genetic abnormalities, known as
chromosome painting, promises to make the diagnosis of cancer and certain
genetic diseases faster and cheaper.
The first chromosomal paint to reach the market is the result of a joint
venture between the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and
Imagenetics, a medical diagnostics company based in Illinois.
They have developed fluorescent tags which can specifically label each of
the 23 pairs of chromosomes present in normal human cells. Each tag is a
pool of between 10,000 to 100,000 fragments of DNA that will identify only
the chromosome from which they have been made.
Another chromosome painting kit has been developed in the UK at Cambridge
University's department of pathology and is being commercialised in
collaboration with Cambio, a biological reagents supplier also based in
Cambridge.
The products were developed initially for scientific research. Doctors are
now hoping they receive quick approval from the regulatory authorities in
the US and Europe for use in routine clinical diagnosis.
The technology enables scientists quickly and accurately to spot defects
within cells, such as missing or extra chromosomes, or genetic material
exchanged incorrectly between two chromosomes. The ability to identify
genetic changes in evolving cancer cells should help doctors both to direct
therapy to specific targets and to analyse the effectiveness of treatment.
Last October Imagenetics began commercial production of orange paints for
nine chromosomes. Each paint kit can perform 20 tests and sells for Dollars
400 (Pounds 200). Sales took off much more quickly than expected for a
product sold for research purposes only, and according to the marketing
company Life Technologies, the paint has generated record telephone
inquiries.
The initial success recently led Imagenetics to offer the original nine
chromosomal paints in an additional green colour, which will allow two
chromosomes to be identified simultaneously within any cell. A second set,
containing nine more chromosomal paints, will become available later this
year.
Doctors using the paints appear to have no doubt about their usefulness. For
example, in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, genetic material from
chromosomes 9 and 22 is mixed together - which can be identified using the
paints.
If the leukaemia is progressing rapidly, several additional copies of
chromosome 8 may be present within a cell. 'Painting is proving to be very
important as a specific indicator of chromosome 8,' says Robert Jenkins,
co-director of the cytogenetics laboratory at the Mayo Clinic. 'This enables
us to monitor the progress of leukaemia patients and to diagnose the
effectiveness of treatment much more cheaply and more accurately than with
conventional methods.'
It costs Dollars 500-Dollars 600 for each normal bone marrow sample, but
only Dollars 20 plus labour costs for each paint probe. 'I would love the
paints to be FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved for clinical use -
we have patients we could use them on tomorrow,' says Jenkins.
In addition to the leukaemia research, scientists are developing specific
chromosome probes to diagnose and track the aberrations associated with
congenital abnormalities. Joe Gray and Dan Pinkel, who first developed the
staining techniques at Livermore, left last year to head a team at the
University of California Medical Centre in San Francisco, working on such
probes for clinical application.
For example, they now have a probe comprising part of Chromosome 21 which
can determine whether a foetus has Downs Syndrome. And they are making
progress with probes to identify solid tumours including breast and prostate
cancers.
Tom Mozer, project manager at Imagenetics, is hopeful that second-generation
forms of chromosomal paints will achieve widespread clinical use. 'The
company and its clients are working very closely with the FDA to get
approval for the clinical use of the second-generation probes. Any
application is a test case, however, as the FDA has never approved a
specific cell stain of this type, and has only approved one genetic test for
leukaemia.'
A separate line of research is continuing at Livermore, where senior
biomedical scientist James Tucker is using the staining to examine the
genetic consequences for people who have been exposed to radiation. He is
working with both Chernobyl victims and workers at British Nuclear Fuel's
Sellafield plant.
So far blood samples from 14 Sellafield workers have been 'painted' over the
course of a year to quantify the damage that has accumulated to their white
blood cells from long-term occupational exposure to radiation. British
Nuclear Fuels says that up to 170 Sellafield workers will have been tested
by the time the project is finished in 1994. Results will be published then.
