PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR HIRED IN LONG BEACH POLICE PROBE 
A private investigator has been hired to check out allegations of misconduct in 
the Long Beach Police Department, city officials said Monday. 
Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said the investigation involved employees "pretty 
high up" in the department, but he would not name them or say what actions are 
under review. The investigator, Leslie (Pete) Norregard of Irvine, will report 
directly to City Manager James C. Hankla, according to a Police Department 
memo. 
One police officer who confirmed that he was interviewed by Norregard said he 
was asked whether Deputy Chief David Dusenbury was involved in any misconduct, 
including an incident three years ago in which Dusenbury allegedly hired as his 
secretary a woman with misdemeanor arrest record of prostitution and petty 
theft. 
The officer, Jack O'Neil Jr., said he was asked similar questions in December 
by a deputy police chief who oversees the department's internal affairs 
section. 
Dusenbury, who once headed the department's vice squad and had a reputation for 
being tough on prostitution, refused to comment. He referred questions to 
Police Chief Lawrence L. Binkley, who also said he could not to comment. 
One former police official, retired Deputy Chief William Stovall, said Monday 
that he raised questions about Dusenbury's choice of a secretary with 
then-Chief Charles B. Ussery. Dusenbury told him he knew of the woman's 
criminal past and promised to fire her if she got in trouble again, Stovall 
said. But Stovall said he was worried because the woman had access to police 
computer records. 
The secretary worked for the police force for only a month, Stovall said. He 
did not know why she left. 
Before he retired in August, 1987, Stovall said, he also told the new Police 
Chief Binkley about the incident. 
The current investigation was disclosed recently in a memorandum to the city's 
650 police officers. In it, Binkley asked that all department employees 
cooperate with Norregard in an inquiry that is "being conducted under and 
directly for" Hankla. 
Kell said the hiring of a private detective was unusual but may become more 
commonplace to lend credibility to investigations of alleged police misconduct. 
"It hasn't worked too well having the police investigate the police," the mayor 
said. 
Three plans to create a police review board or have an independent investigator 
are being reviewed by the Long Beach City Council. The proposals are an 
outgrowth of the Jan. 14 confrontation between a white Long Beach police 
officer and Don Jackson, a black Hawthorne police sergeant who conducted a 
secretly videotaped "sting" in the city to demonstrate what he said was racism 
and brutality by police there. 
Jackson was arrested after a traffic stop, but the case against him was dropped 
and the officer himself charged for allegedly using excessive force and filing 
a false police report.
