FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: A new world of opportunity - John
Cuthbert looks at the mounting attractions of international growth unit
trusts
For years, buying an international growth unit trust meant geographical
diversification, with a dollop of Far East exposure thrown in for spice. Not
any more. Technology, increasing global competition and emerging stock
markets have shaped a new world of investment opportunity.
These changes have transformed the character of the international growth
sector. Trusts now come in three broad shapes and sizes: global growth,
emerging markets and specialist (from small companies to bio-technology).
The differences between the investment objectives, the managers' constraints
and the risks of these different types of international trust are now so
great that investors must take them into account when assessing past
performance. The best way to do this is to treat each of these three types
of separate classifications in their own right. For these reasons, we will
be reviewing the international growth sector in two parts*, starting with
global growth funds and following with emerging market and specialist funds.
This division also helps to redress the domination of the cumulative total
return tables by emerging market and specialist funds - a situation which
obscures the existence of a number of global growth performances of equal
worth.
The main aim of this review is to spotlight the funds with the best
historical performances. To do this, we have adopted three performance
standards. The first is the FT-A World ex-Japan index, which acts as our
benchmark for selecting the best performances. Only funds that have
outperformed this index in the four years to November 30 1993 are worth
considering.
We have selected the World ex-Japan rather than the FT-A World because the
high weighting and poor performance of the Japan market has acted as a
considerable drag on the World index. Thus, managers could have beaten the
FT-A World simply by underweighting Japan alone. How managers have reacted
to Japan is an important measure of their asset allocation skills but should
not be the overwhelming one.
A global growth fund could just as easily have beaten the benchmark by
exposure to the emerging markets. In fact, this is exactly what many funds
have tried to do, with trusts increasing their emerging markets holdings.
Baring Global, for example, has maintained a 25 per cent emerging market
weighting. Martin Currie International Growth has opted for even more. For
these reasons, performance assessment has to take risk into account. So, our
second performance standard is the ratio of a fund's risk to its return. The
figure for the FT-A World ex-Japan index is 0.21. Good fund managers must
aim to beat this.
This approach has produced dramatic results. Strong total-return performers
like Baring Global, Templeton Global, GAM International and GT
International, which are otherwise well-managed, are excluded from our
'magnificent seven' list because of their higher than average risk profiles.
On the other hand, Martin Currie and Framlington International Growth have
achieved high risk/return scores in spite of their higher risk. This is
evidence of managerial ability.
The final standard is consistent outperformance of the chosen benchmark.
Each fund's performance has been divided into four year-on-year total
returns. It is paramount that performance should be assessed in this way,
rather than on a cumulative basis.
In the past four years, most global funds have been very wrong on Japan. But
a four-year cumulative total-return figure does not show this because many
global funds also have a heavy UK weighting. The explosive performance of
the UK market in the past year has allowed many managers to catch up all
they have lost in the previous three.
Consistency is a way to measure the success of the manager's asset
allocation strategy. Like our other two measures, consistency is a measure
of manager ability.
In all, the international growth sector has 159 funds. We have surveyed the
80 or so of these which qualify as global growth funds with four-year
records, and the seven best performances are shown in our main table.
To these seven could have been added a further four. Rock Asset Managed,
Cannon Global, GA Growth Portfolio and GT International have all beaten the
benchmark on a total return and risk/return basis. In addition, there are
younger funds with risk/return performances that would have merited
inclusion here were it not for their youth. The best of these are Clerical
and Medical UK and Overseas, Newton General, Prosperity Global PEP, and
Smith &amp; Williamson Thorobred.
Although our top seven have been ranked on the basis of risk/reward scores,
these figures reflect different strengths and weaknesses. Framlington and
BOI Worldwide Opportunities, for example, have made their way into the top
seven despite their high risk ratings. But that is about all they have in
common.
Whereas BOI Worldwide has the most distinguished record of outperforming the
benchmark consistently, Framlington's stock-picking history has been a
roller-coaster ride. Interestingly, Framlington's strong 1991 performance
was the result of quality stock selections in the US market where most other
managers have failed to make headway.
BOI, by contrast, has done well in Hong Kong, another market where many
managers have fought shy. Also, it has maintained a very high exposure to
emerging markets; hence the high risk rating. Investors have been rewarded
for this risk; hence the high risk/return score.
Martin Currie International's calamity was to have been exposed to Latin
America when the Bolsa turned belly-up, and its 1991 record suffers as a
result. Otherwise, this is a slight blemish on a record which stands out for
many reasons - including getting Japan just about right.
The tactical emphasis of Scottish Equitable's Worldwide Tactical performance
trust is at once both the fund's strength and an insight into the sector's
most troubling weakness. Whereas most international growth funds maintain
some exposure to a core group of markets regardless, Scottish Equitable buys
only in those markets which it deems attractive.
The most striking statistic is the 1990 return of the Perpetual PEP Growth
and Income fund; that year, the World ex-Japan index lost 19.35 per cent and
the international growth sector followed suit. But Perpetual PEP Growth made
money out of a highly defensive UK equity strategy.
Indeed, like BOI British and Overseas and Newton, Perpetual maintains a
minimum proportion of the fund in UK equities. In part, its high risk/return
rating results from the UK's strong performance, but its steadiness is
helped also by success in the US and the Far East.

KEY TO TABLE: Years are November-to-November. NB The four year total is
based upon monthly percentage changes so does not sum to the four
year-on-year totals. The Benchmark column shows the arithmetic
difference between the fund's return and the index's return. The BM or
benchmark ratio expresses the percentage outperformance by the fund
over the four years. Risk is total risk or volatility. Total risk is
measured by the monthly standard deviation over four years to November
30. Risk relative to sector is each fund's standard deviation divided
by the sector's average standard deviation of 4.52. Risk/return is the
division of the four year average monthly total return by the four year
monthly standard deviation. Return data is offer-to-offer, net income
reinvested. Source: Hardwick Stafford Wright. Other calculations: J
