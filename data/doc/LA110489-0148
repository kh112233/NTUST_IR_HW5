ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; 
PHONE FUND-RAISERS MISLEAD, POLICE SAY 
The Police Department is warning residents to beware of people soliciting money 
over the telephone in the name of the Newport Beach police. 
According to Andy Gonis, police spokesman, the majority of complaints have come 
from residents who have been contacted by a firm that is soliciting 
contributions for another police department. 
Gonis said some people have complained that the solicitors portray themselves 
either as Newport police officers or representatives of the department. Gonis 
said they are not. The Newport Beach Police Employees Assn. does not 
participate in any type of fund-raising by telephone or door-to-door 
solicitation, according to Gonis. 
Gonis noted, however, that some police organizations do solicit by telephone 
and that people should take the time to verify that all solicitations are 
legal.
