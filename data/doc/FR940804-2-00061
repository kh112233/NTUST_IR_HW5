k. Description of Project: The proposed project would not be located on any natural body of water, but would consist
of: (1) a 225-foot-high, 1,500-foot-long embankment impounding the 77-acre upper reservoir in a natural basin on
Big Mountain; (2) 8,600 feet of tunnel and penstock, including a surge shaft; (3) earthern embankments totaling 7,100
feet long, with a maximum height of 180 feet, containing the 102-acre lower reservoir at the foot of the mountain; (4)
an underground, 60-foot-diameter caisson-type powerhouse at the lower reservoir with an installed capacity of
200 megawatts, with a switchyard at the surface; and (5) a 19-mile-long transmission line connecting to PacifiCorp's
existing transmission system. Water for the initial fill and for make-up would be purchased from existing water rights
holders, and is expected to come from the local aquifer. 

The project would generate an estimated 627.5 Gwh of energy annually. The estimated cost of the studies to be conducted
under the preliminary permit is $1,000,000. No new roads would be needed for conducting studies under the preliminary
permit. 

l. Purpose of Project: Project power would be sold to PacifiCorp.

would occupy or affect public lands or reservations of the 
United States; (3) would utilize surplus water or water 
power from a government dam; or (4) if applicable, has 
involved or would involve any construction subsequent to 
1935 that may have increased or would increase the project's head or generating capacity, or have otherwise significantly
