  [Text] This year will see significant growth in Hainan's 
electric power industry. Plans for the entire year call for the 
installation of some 400,000 kilowatts in new capacity. In 
1994, Hainan's hydroelectric power and water conservance hub, 
the Daguangba hydropower station, the Nanshan power plant, and 
other projects will go on stream one after the other, basically 
easing the energy shortage.
