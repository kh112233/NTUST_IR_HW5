FT  01 MAY 91 / UK warning of tough stand on CAP reform
MR Norman Lamont, UK chancellor, yesterday served notice that Britain would
push hard for a reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural
Policy and the liberalisation of world trade in agriculture.
In a hard-hitting speech to the development committee of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank he also said Britain would only be prepared to
give assistance to east European countries that maintained democratic
institutions and respect for human rights. He said the IMF and World Bank
should put more pressure on countries they were helping with economic reform
programmes to avoid excessive spending on arms.
Mr Lamont said that EC farm support was 'spiralling upwards' in the wake of
rising production and surplus stocks. The CAP was again imposing severe
strains on Community finances and taxpayers in addition to the substantial
costs borne by EC consumers through high food prices.
He said the dumping of European farm surpluses on foreign markets was
damaging many agricultural producers in the developing world.
It was 'nonsensical' that richer nations should give financial aid to
eastern Europe and third world nations at the same time as frustrating their
efforts to export the goods and agricultural products which the aid had
helped them to produce.
Mr Lamont called on fellow finance ministers to back Britain's proposals to
ease the debt burden of the poorest developing nations.
He said he hoped the Paris Club of creditor nations would develop a
practical package of measures incorporating the main elements of the
so-called Trinidad terms.
These terms, first proposed by Britain last autumn, envisage creditor
countries writing off two thirds of the official debt owed by very poor and
insolvent developing nations that are implementing economic reforms and
stretched out repayment terms for the debt that would remain.
