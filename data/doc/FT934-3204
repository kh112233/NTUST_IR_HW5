FT  09 DEC 93 / Two jailed for attack on Turks
Two German skinheads found guilty of murdering three Turks last year were
sentenced yesterday to maximum jail sentences. Michael Peters, 26, was
jailed for life and Lars Christiansen, 20, received a 10-year prison
sentence - the maximum for a juvenile.
The verdict was 'the strongest signal yet given to neo-Nazis by a German
court', said Mr Hans-Christian Stobele, the prosecutor in the case.
The two skinheads were charged with three counts of murder for burning down
the home of a Turkish family in the northern town of Molln in November 1992
and causing the death of an elderly woman and two young girls.
The Mo lln attack shocked west Germans, many of whom demonstrated in
candle-lit marches across various cities. Candles and flowers still mark the
site of the attack where the destroyed house has now been replaced by
condominiums.
The verdict was applauded by members of the Turkish community in Germany.
But they were quick to point out that police had still brought no-one to
trial for the murder of five Turks who died in an arson attack last spring
in Solingen.
Meanwhile, Mr Nobert Weise, the North Rhine-Westphalia prosecutor, said that
far right extremists had been compiling files, including names, addresses
and photographs of anti-fascist organisers in Germany and of members of the
far left.
