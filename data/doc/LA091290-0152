PROTESTERS TRY TO HALT DEPARTURE OF RECHRISTENED EXXON VALDEZ 
Protesters in inflatable boats surrounded the former Exxon Valdez before dawn 
today, climbing her sides to unfurl a banner and chaining themselves to her 
rudder. Nine protesters were arrested. 
Harbor Police using bolt cutters freed two protesters from the environmental 
activist group Greenpeace who had chained themselves to the tanker's rudder 
about 20 feet above the water. The pair, along with a third protester 
attempting to hang a banner from the rudder, were arrested, Sgt. David Rohowits 
said. 
Harbor Police Chief Arthur LeBlanc said nine people were arrested. 
Exxon spokesman Les Rogers in Houston said Greenpeace protesters in motorized 
inflatable boats pulled up to the stern of the tanker about 4:30 a.m. as the 
giant ship was preparing to get under way for the Middle East. 
The tanker, renamed the Exxon Mediterranean in July at the end of an 
unprecedented refitting, caused the worst oil spill in American history in 
Alaska's Prince William Sound in March, 1989. 
Kelly Quirke, a Greenpeace spokesman, said four people, including one who fell 
and hurt his arm, climbed the side of the ship to hang a banner that read "Sane 
Energy: When?" 
Protesters also floated an oil boom and a 20-foot inflatable globe about the 
ship. 
"We wanted to blockade the Valdez to call attention to the fact it represents a 
battleship in the war on the environment," Quirke said. "It has put us in the 
precarious position of being on the brink of war in the Middle East." 
Once the protest was over, a blanket of fog rolled in and the tanker's 
departure was put on hold.
