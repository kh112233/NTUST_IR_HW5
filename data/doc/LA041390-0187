STOCK SPECIALIST FIRM FINED FOR SECURITIES FRAUD 
A specialist firm on the New York Stock Exchange was fined $480,350 for 
securities fraud by a judge who said he imposed the sentence as a deterrent. 
"The trading while in possession of confidential material is a crime." U.S. 
District Judge Charles S. Haight said Thursday at the sentencing of Marcus 
Schloss &amp; Co. 
"It constitutes an affront to the fair operation of the marketplace." 
Prosecutors said Marcus Schloss was the first NYSE firm to be convicted of 
felony charges related to insider trading. 
The company was convicted last July of conspiracy to trade on inside 
information and of securities fraud in connection with its March 1986 purchase 
of stock in American Brands Inc. 
Marcus Schloss could have been fined a maximum of $1 million -- $500,000 for 
each of two counts. 
Haight, however, said he considered only a fine of $500,000 because both 
charges stemmed from the American Brands deal. 
From that amount, the judge said he subtracted $19,650 which the company 
previously paid the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil charges 
stemming from the American Brands trade.
