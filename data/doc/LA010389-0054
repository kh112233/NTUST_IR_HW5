SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 
Conine states that it would not be unfair to expect Social Security recipients 
to shoulder their share of cutting the deficit. He forgets one thing. Social 
Security recipients, by and large, live on a fixed income. Any new burden 
cannot be shouldered without extreme hardship. 
I was a notch-year baby so I do not get my fair share of Social Security. The 
tax reform bill raised my taxes, not lowered them. Now I must pay a lot more 
than I planned on for Medicare, $31.90 per month plus user taxes. 
Now, people like Mr. Conine feel that I must shoulder more taxes. I wish they 
could walk in my shoes for the proverbial mile.
