FT  27 JUL 93 / MP protests at whaling by Norway
MR TONY BANKS, Labour MP for Newham North West, was freed yesterday by
police after he chained himself to railings in central London in protest
against Norway's resumption of commercial whaling.
No charges were brought against Mr Banks, a strong animal rights campaigner.
'I will continue to protest,' he said after the fire brigade cut him free
from railings at Norway House just off Trafalgar Square. 'What form of
protest I take will depend on the opportunities and the occasion,' he added.
In all 35 people were arrested after the protest organised by Greenpeace,
the environmental group, outside the offices of the Norwegian tourist board,
state railways and chamber of commerce.
Norway announced in May that it planned to resume commercial whaling in
spite of the International Whaling Commission's 10-year moratorium, which
Norway has observed since 1987. A majority of the 39 member countries of the
IWC refused to lift the ban at their annual meeting in May in spite of
intense pressure from Norway and Japan.
Since then Norwegian whalers from the Lofoten Islands, 100 miles inside the
Arctic Circle, have caught more than 100 minke whales. Norway estimates that
there are 87,000 of the 25-foot whales in the north-east Atlantic.
