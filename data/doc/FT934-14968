FT  14 OCT 93 / Business chambers in Kent join forces
SMALL CHAMBERS of commerce in Kent are joining together to promote the
county's attractions as a business centre in competition with continental
markets.
The formal establishment of the single European market and the opening of
the Channel tunnel next year highlight the need for more effective business
support in the county.
The creation of the Kent Chamber of Commerce and Industry is intended to
boost local industry's exports, improve the quality of business information
and strengthen training.
Kent's fragmented chamber network, just across the Channel from powerful,
publicly funded chambers in France and Belgium, has long been regarded as an
example of the weakness of the British system.
Six of Kent's smaller chambers, including Maidstone and Dover, with a
combined membership of 1,500 businesses, have combined to form the new
chamber and talks are continuing to bring in a further five, including
Dartford, Ashford and Canter-bury.
Mr Graham said that if agreement could be reached between all 11 chambers,
the Kent chamber would have a membership of 3,000 businesses and rank third
among UK chambers after Birmingham and Thames Valley.
