FT  05 NOV 93 / Asylum seekers decline
THE number of asylum applicants seeking refuge in Germany last month
totalled 16,660, nearly the same as the previous month, but two-thirds lower
than the same period last year, the federal interior minister announced.
The figures are expected to fall further in view of July's new asylum law,
scrapping article 16 of the constitution giving asylum seekers an automatic
right to stay in Germany.
Nearly half the refugees entering Germany last month came from the former
Yugoslavia, a trend which has continued unabated since the war erupted in
June 1991. Romanians account for the second largest group.
