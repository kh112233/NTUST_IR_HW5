  [Text] National anti-mafia prosecutor Bruno Siclari was in 
Turin today to give details about the operation on Saturday that 
resulted in Italy's most important ever drug seizure. 
  Pure cocaine worth 300 billion lire was seized from several 
warehouses in the province of Turin in what was the largest 
anti-drug operation ever carried out in Italy against the South 
American drug-traffickers linked to the Mafia and the 
'Ndrangheta [Calabrian mafia]. 
  They had discovered a new way to transport vast quantities 
of 
cocaine to Italy by ship and long-haul vehicle. The mafia 
wanted to run its business from the old warehouses owned by 
small-time crooks at Borgaro in the province of Turin. 
Following 12 months of investigations, the anti-mafia 
investigative directorate under Siclari and Turin Chief Public 
Prosecutor Marcello Maddalena had the foot soldiers and heads of 
the organization arrested. The organization was to supply drugs 
to central Italy and eastern Europe. This is what Siclari said: 
  [Begin Siclari recording] This finding means that there is a 
definite link between Colombians and organized crime in Italy, 
because it is unthinkable that this amount of drugs would be 
sent if very solid links did not already exist. [end recording]
