  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rica's economic developments monitored through 
18 January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas has reported that, 
according to preliminary figures, imports amounted to $1.970 
billion and exports to $1.975 billion in 1993. He noted that 
exports increased $400 million (17 percent) over the previous 
year. Rojas added that despite problems, banana exports had 
increased $40 million, meat exports $26 million, and plants and 
flowers exports $15 million. The foreign trade minister also 
reported that the GNP had increased 6.5 percent. (San Jose LA 
REPUBLICA in Spanish 8 Jan 94 p 15A) 
  Central Bank President Jorge Corrales returned from a 
meeting 
with IMF officials in Washington on 7 January. He reported that 
the fiscal targets for 1993 had not been met because the 
economic adjustment program had failed to yield an expected $95 
million, which was to be used to replace domestic debt with 
foreign financing. He asserted, however, that the targets 
agreed upon with the IMF would be met easily and that the bank's 
international reserves amounted to $945.5 million on 31 
December. He highlighted that revenue from exports, tourism, 
and foreign investment had covered payments for goods and 
services imports; the nearly total cancellation of the foreign 
debt, including $90 million owed to the Paris Club; and the 
increase of the country's foreign exchange reserves. (San Jose 
LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 8 Jan 94 p 14A) 
  Central Bank President Jorge Corrales reported that Costa 
Rica's economy registered a substantial increase of 6.3 percent 
in 1993. He said the effects of the increase were starting to 
benefit the people, and he cited a General Directorate of 
Statistics and Census report that revealed that 50,000 new jobs 
opened in the country last year, prompting prompted the 
percentage of poor people in the country to decrease from 24.5 
percent in 1991 to 17.4 percent in 1993. Corrales said the 
unemployment rate was "one of the lowest in America -- only 4.4 
percent." He added that the consumer price index had decreased 
from 25 percent in 1991 to 9 percent in 1993 and that inflation 
had dropped from 12 percent to 9.8 percent. He said an 
important factor in the development of the country had been the 
drop in the public sector's overall deficit from 5.4 percent of 
GNP in 1990 to 2 percent in 1991, 1.4 percent in 1992, and 1.3 
percent in 1993. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0027 GMT 13 Jan

  The government Exports and Investments Promotion Center 
today 
reported that North American countries bought almost 50 percent 
($1.025 billion) of the country's total exports in 1993. The 
official organization reported that the second most important 
region was the European Union, which purchased 24 percent of the 
exports, while the Central American region bought 17 percent 
($348 million) of the total exports last year. The center 
highlighted that exports to Mexico had increased from $17 
million in 1992 to $63 million in 1993. Meanwhile, exports to 
Chile rose from $4 million in 1992 to $10 million last year. 
The export sector increased 17 percent last year mainly because 
of a rise in tourism, an activity that generated an average of 
$40 million a month, which is only surpassed by the nation's 
banana revenues. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1653 GMT 15 Jan
