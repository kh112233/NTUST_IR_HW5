for a `Clean' Fusion Reactor"] 
  [Text] The International Conference on Materials for 
Fusion Reactors, organized by the EC Commission and the Advanced 
Materials Institute of the Joint Research Center at Ispra 
(Varese), was held in Stresa, Italy. This was the sixth edition 
of the biennial conference following those held in Tokyo, 
Chicago, Karlsruhe, Kyoto, and Clearwater. 
  One of the short-term objectives of the EC is the 
construction of an experimental reactor as part of global 
cooperation. It will be based on the magnetic confinement of 
deuterium and tritium plasma, followed by the design and 
construction of a demonstration reactor. 
  The experimental fusion reactor, named ITER [International 
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor], is to be built around the 
year 2000 and already involves major research efforts into 
materials, subjected to the extreme service conditions which 
cause their deterioration. 
  The international conference in Stresa, attended by 400 
scientists from 23 countries (for the first time there was a 
major delegation from Russia), examined the mechanisms of 
degradation and the remedies for expanding the working potential 
of materials for fusion reactors. 
  More specifically materials can be developed which, though 
becoming partially radioactive due to the neutrons generated by 
the fusion process, will be able to lose their radioactivity 
gradually within 20-30 years. By using this type of material 
the energy generated by the fusion process may become clean.
