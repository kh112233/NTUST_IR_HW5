Building, Although It Is Possible To Make Use of the Scrap"] 
  [Text] Despite the image Ukraine has acquired as an 
unpredictable state because of its nuclear missiles, it is 
precisely Ukraine that strictly adheres to the agreement on the 
Reduction of Conventional Weapons in Europe. The photograph 
below shows how MiG-21's and MiG-23's are being destroyed. In 
accordance with the agreement, the destruction of the technology 
must be completed within three years, although 115 aircraft have 
already been eliminated. One circumstance is alarming: Since 
the technology is being dismantled at military units, what 
control over its utilization can one talk about? It is a pity. 
We have repeatedly witnessed how numerous commercial 
structures, which took advantage of the alleged secrecy of the 
operations, made good profits even on this valuable metal scrap. 
They turned over very small amounts of it, if at all, to the 
state treasury. What is going to happen now?
