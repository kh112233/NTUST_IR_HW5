  [Text] Ankara, April 16, IRNA -- The Iranian Embassy here 
has rejected accusations levelled by the Turkish Daily HURRIYET 
that Iran was selling missiles to Armenia and printing 
counterfeit dollars. 
  HURRIYET in its Tuesday [12 April] issue claimed that 
counterfeit dollars were printed by sophisticated printing 
machines in Iran and Iraq and then taken to Turkish markets. 
  In a statement released Thursday, the embassy said that 
HURRIYET's baseless allegations were aimed at tarnishing the 
image of the Islamic Republic of Iran before the Turkish public 
opinion. 
  The embassy also denied that Iran has sold missiles to 
Armenia.
