<ACTION>
ACTION: 

Notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and to conduct scoping for the U.S. Windpower,
Wyoming Wind Energy Project, Carbon County, Wyoming.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

Under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 as amended, the Bureau of Land Management,
Rawlins District Office, will direct the preparation of an EIS on the potential impacts of a proposed wind energy project.
A total of 1,390 wind turbines and associated facilities will be constructed on 62,000 acres (25,091 hectares) of
private, Federal and state lands over a 1012 year development period in Carbon County, Wyoming. The EIS will
be prepared by a third party contractor. If the project is approved, the BLM will issue a Right-of-Way Grant under section
501 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES: 

Comments will be accepted through February 25, 1994. Public Scoping Meetings will be held at the Jeffrey Center, Third
and Spruce Streets, Rawlins, Wyoming on February 2, 1994, at 7 p.m. and on February 3, 1994, at the Albany Country Public
Library, Large Meeting Room, 310 S. 8th Street, Laramie, Wyoming, at 7 p.m.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

U.S. Windpower proposes to construct a 500 megawatt (MW) Wind Energy Project to be located on Foote Creek Rim and Simpson
Ridge in Carbon County, Wyoming. The project area is located approximately 40 miles (64.35 Km) southeast of Rawlins
and 40 miles (64.36 Km) northwest of Laramie, Wyoming. The Foote Creek Rim portion is in all or portions of approximately
10 sections in Townships 19N and 20N, Ranges 78W and 79W north and west of Arlington. Access to the Foote Creek Rim site
is from I80 and State Highway 13. The Simpson Ridge portion is in all or portions of 92 sections in Townships 20N,
21N, and 22N, Ranges 80W and 81W, south of Hanna. Access to the Simpson Ridge portion is from I80 and State Highway
287 and State Highway 72. Land ownership in the project area is approximately 62% private, 28% Public (administered
by BLM), and 10% State of Wyoming. 




The project will be constructed in phases over a 1012 year period. The first phase, involving 75 MW of electrical
power generated by approximately 215 Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs), would be constructed on Foote Creek Rim in 199596.
Later phases would involve 50MW (approximately 75 WTGs/50 MW) increases per year, as utility contracts are approved,
until the 500 MW capacity is reached (for a total of 1,390 WTGs). Ancillary facilities include, but are not limited
to: above and below-ground electric and communication lines, access roads, substations, control/maintenance
building and transformer sites. The Bonneville Power Administration, Department of Energy, a Cooperating Agency
for the EIS, will execute a power output contract to purchase 25 MW of electricity from the project under element 2b
of BPA's Resource Supply Expansion Program. The Foote Creek Rim phase of the project would meet this requirement.

The wind turbines will be erected on 80 to 120 ft (24 to 37 m) lattice towers with height determined by specific meteorological
and geographic characteristics. The WTGs are variable speed, up-wind, three-fiberglass-bladed machines with
a rotor diameter of 108 ft (33 m). The WTGs will be spaced approximately 162 to 216 ft (49 to 66 m) apart with approximately
1,080 to 1,620 ft (329 to 494 m) between each row. 

Two potential electrical utility interconnections are proposed. The first is with the PacifiCorp 230 kV system at
the Miner's substation at Hanna, WY. A wood pole 230 kV line would be erected from the project site northwest, approximately
25 mi (40 Km), to the Miner's substation. The second proposed interconnection would be with the Western Area Power
Administration's parallel 115 kV lines at a site in T21N, R77W, Sec. 34. A transmission line of approximately 7 mi (11
Km) would extend from the project site northeast to the proposed tap substation.
