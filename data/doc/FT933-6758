FT  26 AUG 93 / Attali given old post
FRANCE'S Jacques Attali, controversial former president of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), was given back his former French
state job yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
A cabinet announcement said he was reinstated as a member of the Council of
State, the country's top administrative court which also advises the
government on legislation. Mr Attali, a 49-year-old former aide of Socialist
president Francois Mitterrand, served on the council before founding the
EBRD in 1990.
He resigned last month after he was criticised for overspending on its
London headquarters and not lending enough to the East European states it
was set up to help. He was succeeded by former Bank of France governor
Jacques de Larosiere.
