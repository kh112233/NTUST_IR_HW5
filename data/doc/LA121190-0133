BLOODHOUND LEADS DEPUTIES TO BANK ROBBERY SUSPECT 
A man who allegedly robbed a bank Monday afternoon was tracked down three hours 
later by a bloodhound and arrested, sheriff's deputies said. 
According to Sheriff's Lt. Larry Richey, Mikaele Luamanuvae, 31, of El Toro 
walked into the Bank of America branch at 22491 El Toro Road at about 3:30 
p.m., handed a note to a teller demanding money and fled with $1,040. 
No weapons were involved. 
Three hours later, a sheriff's helicopter located a brown 1977 Toyota believed 
used in the robbery at the Irvine Medical Center on Sand Canyon Avenue, Richey 
said. Deputies found the money in the car and then summoned Reserve Sgt. Larry 
Harris and his bloodhound Duchess. 
"The dog took a good sniff of the vehicle, went out of the parking lot, went 
into the medical center, went up three flights of stairs and went directly to 
the suspect," Richey said. "And when the suspect saw the dog and the officers, 
he gave himself up." 
Luamanuvae was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of robbery, Richey 
said, adding that it was not clear why the suspect had gone to the medical 
center.
