IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
POLIO LOOKS TO BE ON THE WAY OUT 
International health officials predicted last week that they probably will 
succeed in eliminating polio from the Western Hemisphere by the end of this 
year, a major step in a campaign to eradicate the crippling disease from the 
globe by the year 2000. Polio, or poliomyelitis, caused by a virus in 
contaminated water and food, produced tens of thousands of cases of paralysis 
annually in the United States until the first effective vaccine was introduced 
in 1954. 
So far this year, despite intensive case-tracking efforts, only three confirmed 
cases of polio caused by the natural virus have been found in the Americas, 
compared with 45 by this time last year, said Ciro de Quadros, regional adviser 
to the Expanded Program of Immunization for the Pan American Health 
Organization. Rare cases of paralytic polio also occur in recipients of the 
live-virus vaccine. 
Because of successful vaccination programs, polio cases in the Western 
Hemisphere have been declining steeply over the last decade, from about 6,000 
annually in the late 1970s to 132 last year. 
Polio is a far bigger problem in the Eastern Hemisphere, causing more than 
200,000 cases of paralysis annually.
