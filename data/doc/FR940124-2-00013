SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 Section 156 of Title 35, United States Code, generally provides that the term of a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years if the patent claims a product, or a method of making or using a product, that has been subject to certain
defined regulatory review. Under section 156, a patent is eligible for term extension only if regulatory review of
the claimed product was completed before the original patent term expired.



On December 3, 1993, section 156 was amended by Pub. L. No. 103179 to provide that if the owner of record of the
patent or its agent reasonably expects the applicable regulatory review period to extend beyond the expiration of
the patent, the owner or its agent may submit an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks for an interim
extension of the patent term. If the Commissioner determines that, except for permission to market or use the product
commercially, the patent would be eligible for a statutory extension of the patent term, the Commissioner shall issue
to the applicant a certificate of interim extension for a period of not more than one year.

On January 7, 1994, Procter  Gamble Company, owner of record in the Patent and Trademark Office of U.S. Patent
No. 4,005,196, filed an application for interim extension of the term of this patent under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5). The
application states that the patent claims a composition of matter comprising the food additive product olestra.
The application indicates that the product is currently undergoing a regulatory review before the Food and Drug Administration
for permission to market or use the product commercially. The original term of the patent is set to expire on January
25, 1994. Applicant requests an interim extension of the term of the patent for a period of one year.

Review of the application indicates that, except for permission to market or use the product commercially, the subject
patent would be eligible for an extension of the patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156. Since it is apparent that the regulatory
review period may extend beyond the expiration of the original patent term, an interim extension of the patent term
under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) is appropriate. Accordingly, an interim extension under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) of the term
of U.S. Patent No. 4,005,196 has been granted for a period of one year from the original expiration date of the patent.
