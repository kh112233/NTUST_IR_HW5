BANKS DIG DEEPER TO KEEP EUROTUNNEL CONSTRUCTION GOING 
The Channel tunnel project between France and Britain was given a new lease on 
life today after banks agreed to release funds to keep workers digging for at 
least four more months. 
A banker involved in talks with Eurotunnel SA, the Anglo-French consortium 
overseeing construction and operation of the rail link, estimated the new funds 
at between $500 million and $665 million. 
He told Reuters an official announcement will probably be made Friday. 
The agreement was reached after Eurotunnel settled a dispute with Transmanche 
Link, a group of French and British firms that is building the tunnel, over 
costs that have jumped to more than $11.6 billion from an original estimate of 
$6.6 billion. 
Eurotunnel had said the future of the 31-mile undersea link, due to open in 
1993, was in doubt if the banks did not release the funds.
