FT  12 FEB 92 / Islamic guerrillas held in Algeria
Security forces arrested four Islamic guerrilla fighters, confiscating
weapons and an attack plan, police said yesterday, while courts charged or
sentenced at least 170 Moslem fundamentalists on the second full day of a
state of emergency, AP reports from Algiers.
Algerian radio reported that police found an arsenal of weapons at a mosque
east of Algiers where Moslem extremists killed two police officers on Monday
in a prayer room.
Police denied reports that the killers took hostages at the mosque, in Bordj
Menaeil, 70km east of the capital, as witnesses had said.
