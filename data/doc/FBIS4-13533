  [Text] Asyut, April 20 (AFP)--Islamic militants on 
Wednesday [20 April] shot dead a police general and his 
bodyguard in the fundamentalist hotbed of Asyut, police said. 
  Three militants gunned down General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi and 
his 
police bodyguard in a hail of automatic weapons fire which also 
wounded the general's driver. 
  The dying bodyguard managed to fire back and wound one of 
the 
militants, while the other two fled. The shooting occurred as 
Fahmi was leaving his home. 
  The general's wife witnessed the shooting from a balcony, 
tearing off window shutters and throwing them in a vain attempt 
to drive off the killers. 
  Security officials said the wounded gunman, Hasan Khalifah 
'Uthman, was a key member of the outlawed fundamentalist 
organization al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) in the 
region, a hotbed of Islamic militancy. 
  'Uthman, who was hospitalised, was wanted for a series of 
attacks, the most recent being the killing of a policeman in the 
Asyut region last week. 
  In a statement sent to AFP in Cairo, al-Jama'ah claimed 
responsibility for the latest killing and warned that "the 
liquidation of leading officials in the (interior) ministry is a 
cornerstone of our armed campaign." 
  The aim is to make the authorities "respect the rights of 
Muslims" and end their abuse of human rights in Egyptian 
prisons, the group said. 
  Fahmi, appointed police chief in Asyut for one year last 
August, was the second police general murdered this month. On 
April 9, the general leading the battle against Islamic 
militants, Ra'uf Khayrat, was shot dead in Cairo. 
  More than 130 policemen have been killed since Islamic 
militants declared war on the secular government of President 
Husni Mubarak in March 1992. The confrontation has claimed a 
total of more than 360 lives.
