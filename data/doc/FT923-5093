FT  03 SEP 92 / Church files suit against FDA
The Church of Scientology yesterday filed a lawsuit against the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) claiming the government agency ignored proper
scientific procedures in approving Prozac, Eli Lilley's anti-depressant
drug, writes Patrick Harverson from New York.
The suit has been filed by the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, a group
controlled by the Scientologists, who claim the best-selling drug makes
people suicidal.
