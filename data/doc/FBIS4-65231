  [Text] Ankara, 12 May 1994 (A.A.) -- Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Ferhat Ataman declared on Thursday [12 May] that 
Athens' desire to extend its territorial waters to 12 nautical 
miles is unacceptable. 
  Until 1936, Greece had limited its territorial waters to 3 
miles. After the Montreux Convention on the straits, it extended 
its territorial waters to 6 nautical miles. 
  Turkey claims that Athens' extension of its territorial 
waters to 12 nautical miles will be considered a declaration of 
war. 
  Greek Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas [name as 
received] affirmed that it is Greece's sovereign right to extend 
its waters to 12 nautical miles.
