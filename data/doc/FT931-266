FT  31 MAR 93 / Delhi asks Bank to scrap dam loan
India yesterday asked the World Bank to cancel funding for the half-built
Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) scheme to dam the Narmada river in north-west
India, writes Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. India said it would continue
building the dams from its own resources. The World Bank has lent Dollars
280m of the Dollars 450m it pledged to the project and will now retain the
remaining Dollars 170m.
The bank is dropping the scheme after mounting criticism about the project's
environmental impact. An independent review of the scheme found many
criticisms justified and prompted the bank last October to set tough new
conditions for its continued support.
India has judged it cannot meet the bank's terms, which included a deadline
set for today for preparing detailed proposals on improving the conditions
under which displaced villagers are resettled, and for an environmental
master-plan.
