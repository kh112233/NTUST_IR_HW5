FT  04 NOV 93 / Iraqi shot dead in border kidnap bid
A KUWAITI surveyor shot and killed an Iraqi policeman, wounding a second, in
a skirmish inside the Gulf state's United Nations-defined northern border,
UN observers said yesterday. The incident is among the most serious for nine
months on the border, the demarcation of which Iraq has refused to accept.
The UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (Unikom) said the shooting occurred on
Monday afternoon after three Iraqi policemen crossed into Kuwaiti territory
2km west of Umm Qasr port in an apparent attempt to arrest six Kuwaiti
surveyors. The Kuwaitis were making a survey of properties along the border
strip.
The spokesman said the Iraqi police ignored Unikom warnings to leave the
area. One then opened the door of a car in which the Kuwaitis were sitting
and the Iraqis fired three shots in the air. One of the Kuwaitis then drew a
gun and shot at two of the Iraqis, wounding one in the hand and hitting
another in the chest. The two wounded men were taken to the Unikom
headquarters in Basra, southern Iraq. The UN spokesman said the more
seriously wounded Iraqi later died.
More than 300 unarmed UN observers have sustained a 24-hour watch over the
15km demilitarised zone saddling the Iraq-Kuwait border since the end of the
Gulf war. UN officers said yesterday that there have been sporadic
shootings, from both sides, over the border, but described Monday's incident
as among the most serious since since January, when teams of Iraqis made
organised incursions into northern Kuwait in an attempt to retrieve military
hardwear left after the war.
However, the UN officials said the incident did not appear to signal rising
tensions in the border area. Kuwait is nearing completion of a 3m-deep by
5m-wide trench along the length of its 207km border to prevent Iraqi
incursions.
