  [Text] The Navy General Staff press spokesman denied a 
statement by the Albanian Defense Ministry that last Monday [10 
January] Greek ships violated the Albanian territorial waters. 
  According to the spokesman, the sole purpose of the torpedo 
boat and the patrol ship posted in that area is to avert the 
entry of illegal immigrants into our country. 
  The Albanian Defense Ministry protested to the Greek 
authorities and noted that this was the 3d violation of the 
Albanian territorial waters by Greek ships in less than two 
months.
