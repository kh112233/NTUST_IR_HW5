  [Text] The government yesterday signed a cease-fire 
agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] in 
another step toward ending the secessionist war that has killed 
more than 50,000 people over the last 20 years. 
  Ambassador Manuel Yan, the chief government negotiator in 
the 
talks with the MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari, signed the agreement 
after a government panel finished studying it. Misuari signed 
the agreement on Wednesday. Government officials said Yan did 
not immediately sign to give senior officials time to review the 
pact. The 10-page accord covers 13 provinces in Mindanao and 
Palawan. 
  Hostile actions banned under the agreement include 
kidnapping, hijacking, piracy, bombings, grenade throwing, 
aircraft bomb attacks, artillery shelling, and naval gunfire. 
The MNLF will also identify the location and unit commanders of 
its forces so responsibility for any violation of the agreement 
can easily be pinpointed.
