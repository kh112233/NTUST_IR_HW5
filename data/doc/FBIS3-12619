  [Text] The talks held by Iraqi Foreign Ministry Under 
Secretary Sa'd 'Abd-al-Majid al-Faysal in Tehran have not 
yielded the results Iraq sought to achieve; namely, breaking its 
regional and international isolation. 
  Knowledgeable sources in Tehran have asserted to AL-WASAT 
that the Iraqi official was surprised by Iran's hard-line 
approach toward attempts at normalization between Tehran and 
Baghdad, unlike the previous rounds of talks held late last year 
in Karachi, New York, and Baghdad. 
  The sources said Iran rejected a proposal by al-Faysal to 
resume trade trips along the joint border "because Iran does not 
want to violate the international trade embargo" against Iraq. 
  The sources added that "trade borders, which had been open 
on 
humanitarian grounds and within the framework of the 
international resolutions regarding the economic embargo, were 
shut off completely by a direct decision issued by Ayatollah 
'Ali Khamene'i, the spiritual guide of the revolution." 
Khamene'i stressed that the border shall remain closed to trade 
until further notice in the wake of the killing of several 
Iranian border guards during trade operations last year. 
  The sources said Khamene'i made this decision after 
receiving 
information and warnings that the U.S. Administration is about 
to take "tangible" measures against Iran on charges of violating 
the international economic embargo against Iraq. 
  The sources further said that the Iraqi official suggested 
"sacrificing" the leaders of the opposition organization of 
Mojahedin-e Khalq if Iran agrees to resume trade operations. 
Iranian officials, who were interested several months ago in 
bringing the leaders of Mojahedin-e Khalq under control, 
rejected the tempting Iraqi offer because they believe the U.S. 
Administration is looking for "excuses to harass Iran".
