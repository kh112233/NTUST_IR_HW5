WHITE ENROLLMENT DROPS AGAIN, NEW CENSUS SHOWS 
The latest ethnic census of students in the San Diego Unified School District 
shows the number of whites continues to decline, dropping to 39% this year from 
41.4% a year ago and from 43% in 1988. 
Latino enrollment continues to show large increases, rising to 25.6% from 23.2% 
a year ago. 
Black enrollment remained steady at 16.2%, Filipino enrollment remained at 8% 
and Indochinese enrollment rose to 7.7% from 7.6% a year ago, the report 
indicates. 
The latest figures continue a trend that has seen white enrollment decline from 
more than 80,000 students in 1976 to 46,000, while minority enrollment has 
increased from 41,000 to 72,000. 
Total district enrollment is 118,600 students, now exceeding 1976 levels, after 
having dropped to fewer than 110,000 students in the early 1980s. White 
enrollment is even smaller in the district's 107 elementary schools, at 37.8%. 
The drop compounds district problems in maintaining integration programs and 
puts greater pressure on administrators to boost achievement of Latino and 
black students, who lag behind Asian and white students. 
Throughout the county, 57% of all students are white, 23.2% Latino, 8.3% black, 
5% Filipino and 4.9% Indochinese. 
San Diego city schools trustees Tuesday asked Supt. Tom Payzant for additional 
data on whether white enrollment is dropping proportionately to school 
population growth in the northern areas of the city, which are covered by the 
suburban San Dieguito and Poway school districts.
