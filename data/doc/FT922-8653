FT  12 MAY 92 / Court releases Ward on bail
Judith Ward celebrates release from 18 years in prison for a coach bombing
in which 12 people died. A court yesterday freed her on bail to await formal
quashing of her convictions after ruling that her confessions to the M62
Army coach attack and two other bombings of 1974 could no longer be relied
upon.
