ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
MAN SHOT BY OFFICER IS REPORTED STABLE 
A 19-year-old man who was shot by a police officer after allegedly pointing a 
gun at him was in stable condition Thursday at Western Medical Center-Santa 
Ana. 
Jesus Orejel of Santa Ana was shot in the chest and leg and suffered scratches 
from a police dog during the incident, which occurred about 8 p.m. Wednesday at 
Madison Park in Santa Ana. 
Orejel was taken into custody on suspicion of assaulting a police officer with 
a deadly weapon. 
Residents called police just before 8 p.m. to complain about a man who was 
firing a gun in the nearby park, Sgt. Dick Faust said. Two officers responded 
and when they confronted Orejel, he pointed a 9-millimeter semiautomatic 
handgun at one of the officers, police said. As the second officer approached, 
the suspect turned and pointed the weapon in his direction. The second officer 
then fired several shots at Orejel, police said. 
The suspect then tried to run away but was captured a few blocks away with the 
help of a police dog, according to authorities. 
The names of the officers involved in the incident were not released. Faust 
said that the officer who fired the shots will probably be placed on a 
three-day administrative assignment, which is customary in shooting cases.
