VALLEY EARNINGS: SALE OF AMGEN DRUG LIFTS INCOME TO $3.9 MILLION 
Amgen, a Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology firm that makes pharmaceutical 
products, reported that its net income surged to $3.9 million in the fiscal 
second quarter that ended September 30, more than 12 times the $320,000 in net 
income a year earlier. Revenue doubled to $42.5 million from $21.5 million. 
Gordon Blinder, Amgen's chief executive officer, said the strong third quarter 
results reflected rising demand for the company's drug for treating anemia in 
kidney dialysis patients. The drug, Epogen, received licensing in June and has 
been purchased by 95% of the dialysis centers in the country, Blinder said. 
In the six months that ended in September, Amgen earned $4.7 million, more than 
seven times the $625,000 in net income a year earlier. Revenues totaled $72.6 
million, a 77% gain from $41 million.
