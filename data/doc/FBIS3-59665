  [Text] Each ministry and agency has submitted estimated 
budget requests for fiscal year 1994. Within the austere fiscal 
climate, since the early doubling of the government's research 
and development budget in the outline of science and technology 
policy set forth last year, the importance placed on the science 
and technology budget related to basic research and lifestyle is 
a distinguishing feature. The particulars of the requests from 
each ministry or agency are summarized. 
  Science and Technology Agency The requested amount 
for the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and 
Technology is &yen;16.3 billion, a 22.6&percnt; increase over 
this 
fiscal year's original budget. A substantial increase is eyed 
for two consecutive years. 
  Science and technology useful in improving the quality of 
the 
lives of the citizenry are stressed. The construction of heavy 
particle beam cancer treatment facilities at comprehensive 
medical research radiation laboratories, disaster prevention, 
and safety measures like earthquake prediction were given 
priority. 
  A total of &yen;1.1 billion is requested for the 
establishment of the Ministry Network Promotion Program to 
disseminate research information by linking the national 
laboratories of each ministry and agency via high-speed 
circuits. In addition, &yen;12.7 billion, an additional &yen;3.7 
billion more than this fiscal year, is requested for the 
construction of a large-scale radiation facility. 
  As for space &yen;4.99 billion is requested for a target 
test 
flight around 1999 of an unmanned winged shuttle on which 
research and development have begun. 
  Ministry of International Trade and Industry The 
total amount requested in the budget outline related to 
technological development increased 7.5&percnt; over last year to 
&yen;301,707 million. 
  The amount requested for the New Sunshine Project which is 
approaching the second year of revamping the research and 
development system is &yen;561,768 million, an 8.6&percnt; 
increase. 
Although not new programs, existing projects, such as the wide 
area energy use network and the international clean energy 
system technology which use hydrogen, are being completed. 
  In industrial science and technological research and 
development (&yen;25,853 million, a 6.2&percnt; increase), the 
synergy 
ceramics (high-order structure control fused inorganic 
materials) project is being promoted as pioneering research. In 
addition, five themes including next generation metal 
manufacturing technology have been newly added. 
  Of the other projects, the fourth generation computer 
development (&yen;5,718 million, a 57&percnt; increase) and the 
joint 
international IMS (Intelligent Manufacturing System) program 
(&yen;1,614 million, a 48&percnt; increase) stand out. 
  Ministry of Education A science research expense 
assistance fund of &yen;83.9 billion, a substantial 14.0&percnt; 
increase, is requested. Also, the facilities expense for the 
aging national universities is 14.8&percnt; more than this 
fiscal year 
at &yen;125,019 million. In addition, a new request was made for 
funds to hasten renovation at national universities. 
  The total amount requested by the Ministry of Education was 
&yen;5,613,719 million, a 3.5&percnt; increase. This indicates 
the 
desire to improve the research environment at national 
universities and exceed the previous administration's support of 
research. 
  The total amount requested for promoting costs for basic 
research in specific fields, much of which is targeted to 
research costs of big science like space science, accelerators, 
and nuclear fusion, is &yen;62.58 billion, a 2.9&percnt; 
increase. 
  Ministry of Health and Welfare The request of 
&yen;3.2 billion in the first fiscal year budget for what is 
tentatively called the 10-Year Project To Conquer Cancer is the 
star. This is the successor to the 10-Year Comprehensive 
Strategy Against Cancer that ends this fiscal year. Previously, 
the emphasis was on basic research on explaining cancer. In the 
future, clinical research connected to practical treatments and 
prevention will be advanced. The Comprehensive Cancer Treatment 
Support System will be provided so medical treatment facilities 
nationwide can use the pioneering medical treatment information 
of the National Cancer Center. 
  The amount requested for health science research expenses is 
&yen;11.4 billion (a 20.9&percnt; increase). The overall rate of 
increase was a sizable 5.5&percnt;. The costs of preventive 
research 
on the side effects caused by combining many drugs as well as 
research on medical treatment problems such as the recent 
outbreak of hospital infections and side effects to preventive 
vaccinations have been added as new expenses. 
  In addition to having few patients, the hesitation by 
corporations to perform research, the increased research subsidy 
costs of medicines for rare illnesses, and the cost of 
sponsoring the international AIDS conference to be held next 
August in Japan are included. 
  Environment Agency In the request outlined for 
fiscal year 1994, the amount requested for the science and 
technology promotion fund budgeted for research and development 
is &yen;13,647 million, a 8.5&percnt; increase compared to the 
fiscal 
year 1993 budget. Of this amount, &yen;2,500 million are the 
promotion costs of comprehensive earth environment research. 
This is a 19&percnt; increase, &yen;400 million more than the 
current 
fiscal year. 
  The promotion cost is a budget for survey research targeted 
at preserving the earth's environment. Support is provided for 
joint projects advanced through the cooperation of experts from 
a wide range of research organizations which include not only 
the Environment Agency, but national universities and national 
research organizations under the umbrella of ministries and 
agencies, such as the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, 
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the Ministry of 
Construction. 
  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries&gt; med&gt; 
With the objective of basic and pioneering research, domestic 
animal genome analysis where the genes of domestic animals like 
cows and pigs are analyzed is a seven year project to begin next 
year. &yen;130 million is requested for the coming fiscal year. 
The DNA Bank which systematically accumulates and presents data 
obtained from rice plant genome analysis research will begin 
operation. As for environmental problems, investigations on 
agriculture, forestry, and fishery industrial environment 
restoration technologies will begin.
