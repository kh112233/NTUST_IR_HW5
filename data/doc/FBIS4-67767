  [Text] In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter 
on 13 April, Yelmakov, chief of the Reactor Bureau of Russia's 
Atomic Energy Ministry, who was attending the annual conference 
on atomic power in Hiroshima City, made it clear that Russia 
will seek Japan's cooperation in developing a new-type reactor 
to burn plutonium extracted from the dismantling of nuclear 
weapons. According to the Russian official, Russia will formally 
ask Japan in the near future to cooperate with it in developing 
the new-type reactor in accordance with the Japan-Russia Atomic 
Power Agreement. 
  The new-type reactor, for the development of which Russia 
plans to seek Japan's cooperation, is a fast breeder reactor 
(BN-800) capable of generating 800,000 kw. At present, the 
building of the new-type reactor remains suspended. Russia plans 
to replace the current reactor core capable of breeding fuel 
with a new reactor core capable of burning plutonium extracted 
from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and ultra uranium 
element to process them into fuel. 
  In the interview, Yelmakov also said that Russia intends to 
promote the development of the new-type reactor as "an 
international project like the International Thermonuclear 
Fusion Research Project."
