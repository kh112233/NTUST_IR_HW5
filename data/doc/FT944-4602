FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa steady after rally
Softer London equities and continued gold price weakness eroded early steady
sentiment to leave Johannesburg little changed, and with minimal clarity on
short term direction. A weaker financial rand, however, provided some
support for shares.
The overall index finished 3.2 ahead at 5,722.5, off an early high of
5,741.6. Industrials ended 4.0 better at 6,916.5 and golds gained a slight
0.7 at 1,881.8.
De Beers picked up 50 cents to R90.50 following news that a price fixing
case against General Electric, in which De Beers was implicated, had been
dropped in the US. Anglos lost R1.50 at R226.50.
