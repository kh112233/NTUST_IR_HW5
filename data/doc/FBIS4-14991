  [Text] Tallinn, April 5 -- After a meeting of Estonian 
agricultural leaders on Tuesday [5 April] at the Ministry of 
Agriculture on export and import of food products, the spokesman 
of the Ministry Valdur Telliskivi told ETA that Russia's 
"discriminatory tariffs policy towards Baltics" has lead to 
tensions, considerably decreasing the export of food products to 
Russia. 
  Telliskivi added that if in February Russia's part of 
Estonia's export of food products had constituted about a half, 
increase in tariffs for about a half made it economically 
senseless to export food products to Russia. 
  Minister of Agriculture Jaan Leetsar, however, said that 
when 
Russia raised tariffs, it was not an economic war against 
Baltics but a Russian "domestic problem", adding that the 
Russian new parliament was strongly influenced by agricultural 
leaders that aimed at protecting domestic producers and reducing 
profits made by the mediators. 
  Leetsar has been continuously advocating protection of 
domestic producers, saying that otherwise the Estonian 
agricultural producers, who are in great economic difficulties, 
would not survive the pressure of cheap subsidized food products 
from foreign countries. 
  New tariffs were applied by the State Customs Office of the 
Russian Federation on March 15 to all states that do not have 
most favoured nations status agreements with Russia, thus 
causing the Baltic states, that do not have such an agreement, 
to pay twice as high tariffs as the rest of Europe. Tariffs on 
export of Russian goods were not raised. 
  Leetsar said that a way out of the situation was for 
Estonian 
farmers and agricultural producers to form export associations, 
that would coordinate the export activities. Director of 
Tallinn Meat Factory Lembit Kivisild said, however, that the 
farmers and producers had so many other problems that it was too 
early to found such organisations.
