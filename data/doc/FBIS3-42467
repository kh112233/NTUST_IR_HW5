Article   Type:CSO 

  [Text] A team of American scientists from Livermore National 
Laboratory (California) under the leadership of R. Morrison have 
invented the new porous material Seagel with such a low density 
that the scientists' say it would float away if it were not 
weighed down by the air trapped in its microscopic pores. 
  Seagel, which is biodegradable, was obtained by processing 
agar, a component of brown algae [kelp] that is widely used as a 
thickener during the preparation of food items such as ice 
cream. Its developers say that Seagel is also suitable for food 
and only carbon dioxide and water are formed during its 
combustion. 
  To obtain Seagel, agar is first dissolved in water and then 
an organic solvent and an emulsifying agent are added to the 
mixture which disperses the agar evenly throughout the liquid as 
tiny droplets. The liquid then sets into a gel and is 
freeze-dried to obtain the final product. Depending on the 
conditions of the process and the concentration of the initial 
products, you can obtain a material with different properties 
depending on the individual application: from packaging 
materials to slow-release capsules for medicines. 
  Seagel should find the greatest application with a density 
of 
40-50 mg/cm[.sup]3[/]. This compares with the 60 
mg/cm[.sup]3[/] density of balsa wood, which is widely used 
as an insulating material in supertankers and as a 
noise-absorbing material in high-speed trains. Seagel can also 
replace polyurethane and polystyrene styrofoam, however, you 
need to take into account that the material must be hermetically 
sealed because it dissolves in water at a temperature of 
approximately 50C. However, even this property can be 
useful if Seagel is used as a mold for casting because it 
permits it to be easily washed away to reveal the finished 
product.
