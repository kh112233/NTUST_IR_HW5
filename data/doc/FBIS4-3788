Briefings; from the "Current Affairs" program] 
  [Text] Coming to the issue of ties with Vietnam, Wu Jianmin 
reiterated China's sovereignty over the Nansha [Spratly] 
Islands. The spokesman said China's stand on the islands and 
their adjacent waters enjoys the international legal basis; and 
Vietnam, which had carried out a number of illegal oil and gas 
explorations there in recent years, has infringed on China's 
sovereignty. Wu Jianmin said Beijing has repeatedly stated its 
position to Hanoi. He said while bilateral ties in general have 
been developing steadily, China hopes negotiations on 
territorial disputes will make progress on basic principles 
already reached between the two sides.
