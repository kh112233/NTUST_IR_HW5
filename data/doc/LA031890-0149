UCI HOUSING FOR MARRIED STUDENTS FILLS KEY NEED 
UC Irvine protesters who insist on placing gays in married student housing may 
jeopardize their credibility and lose sympathy with their cause. The insistence 
on placing gays in housing designed for married people because they are 
declared lovers seems self-serving. 
Should heterosexuals who wish to date or "go steady" also have this right? 
The social construct of marriage exists primarily to provide for shared and 
defined responsibility in raising children. That the construct provides for 
social approval of cohabitation is a secondary result. 
Married student housing at universities has evolved to meet the special needs 
of those who have made a legal commitment to live together and raise children. 
Provisions are made for children, including playgrounds, schooling and 
segregation away from single students who might object to their noise level. By 
providing for married student housing, universities acknowledge the coexistence 
of study with societal commitment to raise families. 
Single parents with children are usually placed in married student housing. 
Where they choose to date or have live-ins, it has often been tacitly allowed 
by universities. Those gays who are rearing children and are legally 
responsible for their upbringing presumably should be granted the same rights. 
Focus on the actual needs and desires of gay students in housing would seem 
more appropriate than civil disobedience. 
Do some gays wish to be segregated from heterosexuals? Do they find it 
frustrating or an affront to be assigned to live with a member of the same sex 
who is not a lover? 
Administrators need to be sensitive to the needs of gays, and the assignment of 
an ombudsman is the first step in this direction. Since the door is open to 
meeting actual needs at UC Irvine, one would hope that gays and their advocates 
would not block the door for others to pass through.
