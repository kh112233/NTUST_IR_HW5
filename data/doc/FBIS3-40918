"Checks Revealed No Violations"] 
  [tText] During 1993 15 foreign inspection groups, from 
among other places the United States, Spain, the FRG, Britain, 
Italy, Norway, and Switzerland, worked at combined units and 
other units of the Moscow Military District in accordance with 
the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. 
  These inspections involved visits to troop deployment 
locations and installations where arms and ammunition are 
stored; they found no discrepancies between the district's 
stated stock of armaments and those actually found to be there.
