FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Initiative launched to encourage
women's involvement in politics
Sisters under the skin: Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, and a model of Lady
Thatcher at the launch yesterday of an initiative encouraging women's
involvement in politics. Lady Thatcher will tomorrow unveil a plaque to
Emily Wilding, who threw herself under the King's horse in the 1913 Derby.
The exhibition marks the 163 women MPs since Nancy Astor took her seat in
1919.
