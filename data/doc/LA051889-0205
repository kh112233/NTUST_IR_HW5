WORLD; 
HUSSEIN REJECTS ISRAELI ELECTION PLAN 
King Hussein today rejected an Israeli plan for elections in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying it is an attempt to buy time. 
The Israeli blueprint avoids "facing increasing world pressures to solve the 
(Palestinian) problem in a just and durable way," Hussein said. 
Earlier this week, the Palestine Liberation Organization leadership also 
rejected the plan, which excludes participation by PLO members. Speaking at 
Marka air base near Amman, Hussein said: "This (the PLO decision) is a 
Palestinian move, and I believe it is my duty and the duty of all our Arab 
brethren to support it."
