RIVAL CHRISTIAN MILITIAS DUEL IN EAST BEIRUT 
Rival Christian militias exchanged tank and artillery fire Wednesday in East 
Beirut, violating a shaky 12-day-old truce and sending panicked civilians to 
underground shelters. 
Security sources said that troops loyal to Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun and fighters 
of the Lebanese Forces militia fought at dawn around the hilltop neighborhood 
of Ashrafiyeh. 
The thud of explosions shook the capital and sent panicked civilians rushing to 
bunkers for cover as artillery and mortar shells slammed into residential 
areas. The fighting died down after about an hour. 
More than 700 people have been killed since the battle for control of the 
Christian enclave erupted Jan. 31, when Aoun ordered Samir Geagea's Lebanese 
Forces to disarm. 
Meanwhile, a senior Muslim militia official told Reuters news agency that the 
United States and Iran have held secret talks on releasing eight American 
hostages held by pro-Iranian extremist groups in Lebanon. 
The official, who asked not to be identified, said senior Iranian Foreign 
Ministry officials and an American negotiator met in New York in December. A 
second round of talks took place in Geneva in January. 
U.S. officials on Tuesday denied reports of such direct talks. 
In London, Peggy Say, the sister of journalist Terry A. Anderson, the 
longest-held Western hostage, said she is hopeful that the United States, Syria 
and Iran are cooperating toward the release of the 16 foreign hostages.
