FT  15 NOV 94 / Human Rights Watch report on Angola released
About 100,000 civilians have been killed in Angola since the country's civil
war resumed two years ago, Human Rights Watch said in a report due for
publication today, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
The New York-based organisation said both sides had been guilty of torture,
summary executions and the recruitment of child soldiers. It urged the
United Nations to enforce an arms embargo against the two sides.
The report, released on the same day as the Angolan government and the rebel
movement Unita had been due to sign a new peace agreement, also demanded
that the UN deploy human rights monitors throughout the country.
The report, entitled 'Angola: Arms Trade and Violations of the Law since the
1992 Elections', said the Angolan government had become the biggest arms
importer in sub-Saharan Africa, buying more than Dollars 3.5bn of military
equipment over the past two years. 'The government is believed to have
mortgaged the next seven years of oil production to finance this huge
build-up of weaponry,' it said.
