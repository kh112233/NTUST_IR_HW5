FT  21 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): New source for fish oils
Dwindling fish stocks could lead to a shortage of the fish oils that are in
great demand for nutritional supplements. So an alternative source is being
developed by an Anglo-French joint venture, Clive Cookson writes.
Scotia Pharmaceuticals of the UK and Heliosynthese of France are pooling
their expertise to produce commercial quantities of polyunsaturated fatty
acids, the active ingredients of fish oil, in bioreactors stocked with
microscopic algae. Plants could be built off the Scottish and French coasts.
Heliosynthese has already screened hundreds of strains of ocean algae to
discover ones that grow well and make the desired fatty acids. Scotia plans
to use the output first in nutritional supplements, for example to enrich
infant formulae, and then as the basis for a new range of pharmaceutical
products.
