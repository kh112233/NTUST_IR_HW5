ALL THE TRIMMINGS 
By early this week, the Salvation Army in Torrance had filled two garages with 
canned food donated by individuals, businesses and service organizations, 
including Epson America, Del Amo Fashion Center, Kiwanis and Rotary clubs, 
local schools and Scouting and YMCA groups. 
The food, collected by city workers, will be distributed to about 150 needy 
families before Christmas Day. Other South Bay groups are helping the needy 
this holiday season. Among them are students at Peninsula Heritage School, who 
collected canned food, toys and candy for the "Feed My People" program at 
Rolling Hills Covenant Church, and the Sandpipers, a philanthropic organization 
that expects to assist 43 families, including 131 children, with donations of 
food, toys, clothes and money.
