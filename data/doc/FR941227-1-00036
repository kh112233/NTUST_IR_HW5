SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background



Section4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 

et seq.

), requires that, for any petition to revise the List of Threatened and Endangered Species that contains substantial
scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted, a finding must be made
within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (i) not warranted, (ii) warranted,
or (iii) warranted but precluded by the efforts to revise the list and expeditious progress is being made in listing
and delisting species. Upon making the finding, a notice shall be promptly published in the 

Federal Register

. With this notice, the Service announces its 12-month finding on the petition to list the Canada lynx is not warranted.
This finding is based on various documents, including published and unpublished studies, agency files, field survey
records, and consultations with other Federal and State agencies. This notice summarizes information contained
in the 12-month finding and represents the conclusion of the Service's status review.

In August 1991, the U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition from several conservation organizations
requesting that the Service list the lynx of the North Cascades ecosystem as an endangered species and designate critical
habitat.

On October 6, 1992, the Service published a notice of a petition finding indicating that there was not substantial
information to indicate that listing the North Cascades population of the Canada lynx as endangered may be warranted
(57 FR 46007). On July 9, 1993, the Service published a notice of a second finding on the North Cascades petition after
evaluating new information and again found that there was not substantial information to indicate that listing the
population may be warranted (58 FR 36924). 

Following publication of the notice, the petitioners filed suit challenging the finding. A settlement agreement
was reached on November 30, 1993, where the Service agreed to conduct a full status review of the lynx throughout its
range in the lower 48 States and to determine whether it qualified as endangered or threatened pursuant to 16 U.S.C.
Part 1533(a). On February 2, 1994, the Service published a notice (59 FR 4887) announcing continuation of a status
review initiated in 1982. The Service reviewed and considered public comments during its evaluation of the status
of the lynx in the contiguous U.S.
