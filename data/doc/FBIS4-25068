  [Text] Lanzhou, June 6 (XINHUA) -- Two wild horses are due 
to be born at a breeding farm in the north-west desert -- good 
news for the species at the brink of extinction worldwide. 
  There are only 900 of this breed of horses left all over the 
world, according to a report from the International Wild Horse 
Association. 
  The two pregnant mares are being taken care of in Gansu 
Province by the endangered wild life breeding center, which lies 
in the heart of the Tenggeli Desert. 
  Years ago the wild horse almost became extinct in China -- 
its original birth place. The rescue work started in 1988 when 
the center imported ten horses from the United States and 
Germany. Now altogether 16 horses live in this desert, which 
has nearly half of its area green-covered. 
  Other wildlife, such as saiga antelope, Asiatic wild ass, 
takin, wild camel, gold-haired monkey and white-lipped deer, 
have also found their paradise here. 
  In the monkey village, the youngest is only one month old 
while the oldest is the 13-year-old king. 
  The breeding center will be extended to 6,600 hectares this 
autumn.
