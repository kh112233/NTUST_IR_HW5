FT  13 JUL 94 / Carton-board verdict due
The European Commission is today expected to give its final verdict on
allegations that European carton-board makers are operating an illegal
cartel. The three-year-old case could result in some of the biggest fines
ever to be levied against a group of companies following a Commission
investigation into alleged price-fixing. In April 1991, the Commission
raided 15 companies across the EU after the British Printing Industries
Federation complained that manufacturers had co-ordinated price rises across
Europe. All the main EU producers were involved in the original inquiry
including subsidiaries and sales agents for non-EU companies in Sweden,
Austria and Canada. Today, after considering responses from the 15
companies, the commission is expected to conclude whether a
cartel-arrangement between the companies hindered competition.
