FT  11 NOV 94 / Painful rebirth from the ashes: The economic transition of
the former communist countries is starting to pay off - The fall of the wall
On both sides of Europe, businessmen, bankers, politicians and economists
have been frantically at work since the demolition of the Berlin Wall in
1989. The degree of waste and inefficiency in planned economies has proved
greater than anticipated. But the biggest surprise  - both for east
Europeans and for westerners, who had taken it for granted - has been the
subtlety and sophistication of the market economy.
Mr Dennis Skinner, Midland Bank's representative in Moscow 10 years ago, at
that time described the Soviet-style economy as 'a giant cartwheel' with a
powerful rim, hub and spokes. 'But in between the spokes, in the space which
market economies fill with a rich, interconnecting tissue of financial
services, advertising and marketing, pension funds and the like, was a
void,' he explained.
In essence the past five years have been spent cutting back the bloated
bureaucracies and militarised, monopoly producers, fostering private
enterprise and filling up the space between the spokes.
Thousands of would-be entrepreneurs, bankers and stockbrokers from the east
have set out on a quest to discover the secret of abundance, and the
mechanisms by which wealth is created. And an army of western economists,
consultants, accountants and lawyers has sprung into action to satisfy this
demand.
A new institution, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was
set up to facilitate the transition, while the European Union and individual
governments set up special funds, such as the UK's Know-How Fund, to channel
aid and transfer skills.
Fundamental principles were rediscovered. The most important was the crucial
role of private ownership and the linkage between legality, democracy and
prosperity. The communist state began by seizing private property. The
restitution of private property and privatisation of state-owned assets have
been at the heart of the transition to a law-based, multi-party market
economy and society.
By early next year, with the completion of the second round of mass
privatisation, the Czech government forecasts that 80 per cent of the
economy will be in private ownership. The private sector in most other
central European states now constitutes between 40-65 per cent of the
economy. Even Russia, where macro-economic stabilisation policies are still
being formulated, has managed to privatise about 50 per cent of the economy.
Privatisation has never before taken place on such a scale and at such
frantic speed. And while the privatisation itself has not created enterprise
capital or managerial expertise, it has generated the need for efficient
banks, stock markets and investment funds and sparked off a hunt for foreign
equity investment and managerial skills. The distance from the old command
economy is already enormous.
However, the pain has been greater than originally imagined. Although, the
death agonies of the old system have been exaggerated by a statistical
reporting system based mainly on output from state enterprises, the first
two to three years of reform did see a 20 to 40 per cent fall in industrial
output.
Production of armaments, shoddy consumer goods and obsolete industrial
equipment fell. Millions of workers in what had been secure jobs were
sacked, placing a large burden of social payments on state budgets at the
same time as revenues from taxes on state enterprise profits were
collapsing. Entire industries and company towns have closed or have
stockpiled unwanted goods, failed to pay wages and run up impossible debts.
This industrial decline has been accelerated by the collapse of the Comecon
trade and transferable rouble payments system in late 1990, and exacerbated
by recession and protectionism in the west. Most central European countries
now do more than 50 per cent of their trade with the EU, which, through a
series of bilateral and 'asymmetric' association agreements, offers free
trade in many industrial products but retains restrictions on 'sensitive'
products such as iron, steel, textiles and foodstuffs backed by anti-dumping
and other blocking measures.
In the confusion of the transition to a market economy, many of the state's
best assets have been hived off by communist era factory managers. This has
left the loss-making cores of thousands of enterprises facing bankruptcy. In
Ukraine, Russia and those former Soviet republics where output was
concentrated in military or related sectors, severe problems remain.
But the important point is that the unreformable Soviet system had to be
destroyed if resources were to be freed for productive purposes and export,
instead of being turned into arms or pollution.
Millions of jobs have been created in trade, services and private
enterprises. A wide range of consumer goods, previously unavailable or
restricted to an elite, is now on sale in privatised shops and kiosks. Some
people have grown very rich; the weak, sick and unemployed have become
poorer. But overall the dynamism of the private sector is impressive and
remains under-recorded.
Countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic, which established
macro-economic stabilisation and internally convertible currencies at an
early stage, are now leading an economic upswing throughout central Europe.
The great question of five years ago, of how to create capitalism without
capital, has been largely answered: it has been accumulated from the savings
made by reducing waste and through the privatisation of poorly used former
state assets.
But in the former Soviet Union, in particular, billions of dollars of
capital have been created through the often clandestine expropriation and
export of raw materials, energy and other resources. Many 'robber barons'
have set up foreign bank accounts, awaiting the legal reforms in Russia that
will allow them to repatriate their suitably laundered funds. This capital,
like that amassed by the US and European equivalents in the 19th century, is
needed to capitalise the new private banks and to finance the plants and
infrastructure required to begin the industrial transformation of Russia.
Foreign investment to date has been modest, relative to other emerging
economies in Asia or Latin America. The EBRD calculates that total foreign
direct investment in 1990-93 in the entire former Soviet controlled area,
with 450m inhabitants, totalled Dollars 12.42bn. Singapore alone, with only
3m people, received Dollars 5.6bn just in 1992.
But the slow start was inevitable, given the absence of property title and
the lack of legal and administrative frameworks required to attract and
absorb foreign capital. Foreign investment is now rising, as companies
discover the region's potential and east European governments introduce
institutional changes and open up strategic sectors, such as
telecommunications.
Successful foreign debt reduction and rescheduling agreements by Poland and
Bulgaria have also played a part. Poland, which claims to have received
Dollars 4.5bn in foreign investment to date, expects a similar amount in the
next year or so.
Governments throughout the region have become more sophisticated and more
aware of the global competition for foreign investment. They have learnt
that foreign investment brings more than capital: it also provides
technology, managerial skills and access to world markets.
The big US multinationals and their European equivalents, such as Asea Brown
Boveri, Unilever and Nestle, have been among the first to see the potential
of the east. But close observers, such as Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard
University, argue that EU nations must declare war on their protectionist
lobbies, abolish trade barriers and speed up investment if eastern Europe is
to achieve 'Asian tiger' rates of growth.
