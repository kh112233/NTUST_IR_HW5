  [Text] The population in South Africa is not growing as 
fast as it was, 57 percent is urbanised, and the country's 
education levels are improving slowly. Cape Town, in the 
meantime, has become one of the fastest growing cities in africa. 
  These trends emerge from statistics supplied by the latest 
[South African Institute of] Race Relations survey. The survey, 
recording the results of the most recent census, shows that 
between 1986 and 1991 the population of South Africa (excluding 
the `independent' homelands) grew at an average rate of 1.9 
percent. A year, compared with 2.3 percent. Between 1980 and 
1985. 
  Nevertheless, by the year 2018 the country's population will 
be close to 80m [million], the maximum number of people South 
Africa's water and other resources can support. 
  In 1993 the total population (including the ten homelands) 
was 40.3m, according to an Urban Foundation estimate quoted in 
the survey. 
  Key projections, recorded in the survey, indicate that by 
2010, 69 percent (33.2m) of the total African population will 
live in urban areas and 31 percent (15.2m) in rural areas. This 
means that some 22m additional people will have to be provided 
for in urban areas by 2010. 
  By 2000 the population of Natal will comprise 23 percent of 
the total South African population, of which 54 percent will be 
living in the Durban area. With an average growth rate for its 
African population of more than 13 percent a year between 1982 
and 1992, Cape Town is one of the fastest growing cities in 
Africa. The African population of Cape Town more than trebled 
between 1982 and 1992 from 200,000 in 1982 to more than 900,000 
in 1992 -- an increase of 350 percent. 
  Despite widespread school disruptions, the survey records 
that the proportion of the population with standard six or more 
increased from 32.6 percent in 1985 to 37.4 percent in 1991. 
Those with some form of post-matric education increased from 3 
percent in 1985 to 3.7 percent in 1991. 
  The survey notes, however, that 3m people over the age of 18 
(10 percent of the population) have no schooling at all, while 
1.4m (14 percent of the population of school-going age) are not 
at school. 
  The survey records that Zulu, Afrikaans and northern Sotho 
are the most widely spoken home languages in the country and the 
majority of South Africans are Christians. Of these the largest 
proportion (5.4m people) belong to African independent churches, 
followed by the Dutch Reformed Church (3.2m people) and the 
Roman Catholic Church (2.3m people). 
  According to the World Bank, the survey notes, the pattern 
of 
urbanised land in South Africa is contributing to the 
inefficiencies of its cities. This includes the spatial 
separation of (former) black and white cities, the high 
concentration of jobs and services in (former) white areas, and 
the location of high-density, low-income areas on the fringe of 
the cities. 
  Recommended solutions include increasing the densities of 
residential areas (which would require a change in current 
land-use zoning regulations) and concentrating settlements 
around urban centres.
