 

FSIS has carefully considered whether there is a need to establish minimum protein and/or maximum fat content(s)
for product derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems. FSIS believes that such
action is not necessary because protein and fat are nutrients whose declaration becomes mandatory on the labeling
of most multi-ingredient meat and poultry products upon the effective date of the nutrition labeling regulations
which is July 6, 1994 (58 FR 632). These regulations also establish a voluntary nutrition labeling program for single-ingredient,
raw products, and specify that FSIS will evaluate significant participation of the voluntary program. If significant
participation is not found, FSIS shall initiate rulemaking to require nutrition labeling on those products under
the voluntary program. Therefore, with certain exceptions, consumers will have complete information about the
two nutrients in muscle meat that are the sole source of calories and are characteristic of the nutrient profile of
meat. Such information will ensure that consumers are not misled about the composition of products containing meat
obtained using advanced meat/bone separation machinery.


FSIS recognizes that not all products sold to consumers at the retail level will carry nutrition labeling. FSIS's
final regulation on nutrition labeling provided for certain exceptions, including products produced by small businesses
and products in individually wrapped packages of less than 1/2 ounce net weight, provided that the labels for these
products bear no nutrition claims or nutrition information. However, labeling will be required on most processed
products purchased by consumers in retail stores so that, together with the voluntary program for retail store information
on single-ingredient, raw products, consumers will have information on protein and fat for most products purchased
for consumption at home. Furthermore, FSIS believes that the fat and protein contents of meat derived from advanced
meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems would be comparable to the fat and protein contents of meat derived
from hand-deboning. Based on these considerations, FSIS maintains that there is no need to establish minimum protein
and/or maximum fat contents for products derived from advanced meat/bone separation and recovery systems.



a. 

Calcium content. 

FSIS is proposing to include in the amendment to the definition of ``meat,'' criteria on maximum calcium content (as
a measure of bone solids content) of this meat to assure that the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery
and recovery systems is both consistent with consumer expectations of ``meat,'' e.g., beef trimmings, and comparable
to ``meat,'' as traditionally defined, that is used to formulate further processed meat food products. The criteria
is a measure designed to ensure that bones are not crushed, ground, or pulverized during processing. The maximum calcium
content of 0.15 percent or 150 mg/100 gm of product is supported by data submitted to FSIS for the product derived from
advanced meat/bone separation machinery.

 Furthermore, based upon analytical repeatability studies conducted by the Agency for calcium, FSIS proposes to
establish a tolerance, i.e., allowance for statistical variability, of 0.03 percent or 30 mg/100 gm for individual
samples.

b. 

Protein quality. 

FSIS is proposing to require that meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems
meet a minimum protein quality requirement_a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score of not less than
40 expressed as a percent and to accept as evidence of compliance with this requirement an alternative measurement_the
content of 7 essential amino acids being at least 33 percent of the total of 17 amino acids present. Protein quality
is a measure of the content, proportion, and availability of essential amino acids in food protein and a measure of
the ability of the food protein to support human growth and body protein maintenance.


When the regulations on MS(S) were published in 1982 (47 FR 28214), one of the methods specified for measuring protein
quality was the Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) procedure. The PER method measures the ability of a protein source
to support growth in young growing rats, and is an expensive and time-consuming assay. FSIS adopted a newer method
for measuring protein quality, in order to assure the value of the protein contributed by meat and poultry to human
dietary needs, in its final regulations on nutrition labeling of meat and poultry products published in the 

Federal Register

 on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 632). The newer procedure, termed the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score
method, is contained in ``Protein Quality Evaluation, Report of the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Protein
Quality Evaluation,'' Rome, 1990.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method is based on human amino acid requirements and, therefore,
is more appropriate for evaluating the protein quality of foods for human consumption than the PER which is based on
amino acid requirements of rats. The protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score method measures the ability
of amino acids in food proteins to meet the dietary protein needs of humans.
