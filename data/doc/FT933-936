FT  27 SEP 93 / World Bank/IMF Meeting: Complaints panel to be set up
The World Bank has voted to set up an inspection panel to review complaints
from board members or people affected by its loans, completing a series of
reforms of its operating practices, writes George Graham. The panel will
investigate complaints by any party which believes it has been adversely
affected by the bank's failure to follow its own rules and procedures.
