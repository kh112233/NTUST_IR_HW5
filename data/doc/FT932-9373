FT  14 MAY 93 / US changes tack on African debt
THE CLINTON administration has pledged to write off a small portion of
African debt, in a departure from the hostility to debt forgiveness of
preceeding Republican administrations, writes Leslie Crawford.
Up to now, the US was the only leading industrial country to refuse to
cancel official debt when African countries came to the Paris Club of
creditor nations for debt reschedulings.
Mr Lawrence Summers, US under-secretary for international affairs, told an
African Development Bank meeting in Abidjan the new policy was 'a valuable
first step'.
He earlier told a US congressional committee that with an investment of only
Dollars 14m (Pounds 9m) over the next two fiscal years, the US could erase
Dollars 228m in debt for as many as 18 of the poorest countries, most of
them located in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the initiative is expected to
win congressional approval, it will only make a small dent in the Dollars
255bn Africa owes its donors.
