TEN OF THE HARBOR'S BEST BETS 
There are many things to see and do when visiting Oceanside Harbor. The 
following are just a few ideas. For more information on events in Oceanside, 
contact the Oceanside Chamber of Commerce, 722-1534. 
1) Beer Can Races every Wednesday night, June 13-Aug. 29. Sponsored by the 
Oceanside Yacht Club. Boats race on short courses inside and outside the 
harbor. Sometimes 30 boats compete. Open to anyone with a sailboat. The Yacht 
Club opens to the public after the races for race clinics and barbecues. 
Usually sailed in light, northwesterly winds. For information, call 722-5751. 
2) Nightly bonfires at fire rings lining the beaches of Oceanside Harbor. There 
are plenty of rings, and more are being installed for summer. Roast hot dogs 
and marshmallows to the sound of the roaring ocean. No alcohol, pets or glass 
items allowed on the beach. Bring lots of wood. 
3) Whale watching or fishing on one of Helgren's Sportfishing boats. The
