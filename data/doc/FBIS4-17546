<F P=106> [Olga Gerasimenko and Vasiliy Ustyuzhanin article: "The </F>
Deputies Have Not Gone Round With the Hat, But They Have Done 
Quite a Bit of Traveling -- Such Are the Preliminary Results of 
the State Duma's First 100 Days"] 
  [Text] As one deputy joked rather aptly -- it's funny, but 
the Duma is working. The first 100 days of its work overturned 
the numerous forecasts about an untimely fate for the new 
parliament. To all appearances, nobody (and this particular Mr. 
"Nobody" is very well known) intends to launch another 
antiparliamentary putsch just yet. Indeed, it has to be 
admitted that the Duma members are giving no cause for such 
action. They suffer their everyday hardships stoically (yes, 
they grumble, they appeal for help to our fraternal newspaper, 
PRAVDA, but they are not blackmailing the Kremlin, nor, touch 
wood, are they taking up arms.) And they are legislating with 
tolerable proficiency. The Federation Council, for instance, 
needed 10 days of table thumping to confirm the budget for the 
second quarter, whereas it took the State Duma just one. 
Approximately 100 decrees have been adopted, several dozen laws 
were passed on their first reading, and three, including the 
most important one -- "On the Status of Deputies of the First 
Convocation" -- even went straight through without further 
review. 
  Speaker Ivan Rybkin attributes this work capacity of the 
Duma 
to its well-formulated internal structure. Each Duma committee 
has become a kind of mini-parliament which does not take nine 
months to give birth to laws like the former Supreme Soviet but 
merely brings the presidential and government drafts up to 
standard by means of argument and reconciliation, after which 
thse drafts are discussed in the State Duma Council where the 
faction and committee leaders come to a uniform opinion. Even 
the actual sessional sitting itself serves more as a channel for 
public pronunciation of a decision than for heated debate. 
  Russians are entitled to reproach the Duma for living beyond 
its means -- what with ministerial salaries, cars, dachas, 
foreign trips, and so on and so forth. But each charge acquires 
virtue in comparison. The former parliament, for instance, had 
a fleet of 1,000 cars at its disposal. The Duma is provided 
with just 72, plus 12 buses. But a decision on the allocation 
of a further 300 vehicles has already been prepared. Come 
summer, deputies will be able to take off with their families to 
one of 14 vacation homes, chalets, and dachas. Incidentally, 
the Empress Catherine II also allowed "distinguished citizens" 
to "ride around the city in a coach and two or four, and to own 
suburban courts and gardens." So the roots of deputies' 
privileges (and not only theirs) run deep. 
  Of all the Duma members, just 25 (first come, first served) 
have as yet received apartments following their enforced move 
[za vyseleniyem], and the rest "drift" between the Moskva, Mir, 
and Rossiya Hotels. 
  Unlike the deputies of yesteryear, today's have been 
relieved 
of the need to stand in line for their wages twice a month. 
They line up just once (as in all respectable parliaments 
around the world), which means they receive a lot all at once. 
A deputy's salary fluctuates between 450,000 and 800,000 
[rubles] depending on his post. 
  But let's be honest here: Parliamentarism a priori is an 
expensive luxury. Totalitarianism is cheaper by far, but who 
will be first in line for this option? We are better off 
recalling (and with good cause!) Vasiliy Shulgin, a famous 
deputy from the Fourth State Duma: "...while the deputies 
debate, while they brawl in the parliaments, the machine guns 
lie still. But as soon as these outlets are silenced...the 
malice is directed through other channels." Very well, it is 
better to let deputies get about in a Volvo or a Mercedes, and 
so be it if Zhirinovskiy, like Panikovskiy, feels the blunt end 
of a rubber-soled boot, and all the better if it is painful, for 
through this extravagance and sacrifice they will simultaneously 
save Russian democracy. Is there any more noble lot for the 
people's elected? 
  The Most Diligent, the Most Important [subhead] 
  Do you know, reader, who the most disciplined member of the 
Duma is? It is the Communist Aleksandr Mikhaylov. He has not 
missed a single session, nor skipped a single ballot. Not far 
behind him are L. Gagut, M. Sidorov, and V. Gusev, members of 
the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], the Agrarian S.A. 
Ponomarev, and F. Arslanova of "Women of Russia." They have 
missed just half a session in all. And who is the least 
disciplined? The hypnotist Anatoliy Kashpirovskiy and Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev -- neither has once (!) attended the 
Duma assemblies. 
  Government Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha has attended 
just one session, and then only by necessity: He turned up to 
defend agriculturally related budget stances in front of the 
Duma members. Other ministers have only just bettered these 
records -- Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State Committee for 
the Management of State Property, has attended one session in 
33; Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin -- one in 14; 
Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin -- one in 10; Nationalities 
Affairs Minister Sergey Shakhray -- one in nine; and Minister of 
Justice Yuriy Kalmykov -- one in seven. The most diligent of 
all was Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan, who attended one in 
four. It's enough to make anybody want to become a deputy. 
  Among the most disciplined are the following factions (draw 
your own conclusions, voters) -- "Communists of Russia," 
"Agrarian Party," and the LDPR, while the least disciplined are 
Boris Fedorov's "Liberal Democratic Union of 12 December," 
Gaydar's "Russia's Choice," and Shakhray's Party of Russian 
Unity and Accord [PRUA], and Yavlinskiy's "Yabloko."

  By far the most influential deputies, according to a poll 
conducted by the Sociological Center for the Study of Political 
Culture, are Speaker Ivan Rybkin, Yegor Gaydar, and Gennadiy 
Zyuganov. The top 50 "most influential" includes 11 
representatives of Russia's Choice, six from "Yabloko," and five 
from the Communist Party of Russia, the LDPR, PRUA, and the 
Agrarian Party. So the level of attendance is not directly 
proportional to degree of importance. Rather, it is the other 
way around. 
<H5>  A Journey May Beckon Tomorrow </H5>
  The deputies have done quite a bit of traveling to various 
parts of the world. In less than four months, 72 members of the 
Duma visited 26 countries. As a Volgograd deputy told us, 
foreign trips are often a matter of chance. A breathless 
colleague races up (or, maybe, bumps into you in the elevator) 
and asks: "Do you have a foreign travel passport?" "Yes." 
"Come on, then, we fly this evening." "Where?" "Give me your 
passport, you will find out soon enough." The stunned colleague 
does not resist, and, indeed, by evening he is walking carefully 
up the gangway and onto an airbus. It's a REEEAL honor to be a 
deputy. 
  Admittedly, the State Duma has not yet ratified a single 
international treaty, although the president and the government 
have sent it around 60. Well, we live in hope. This, after 
all, is the way we are: It takes a while to break this animal. 
  The altogether most heated debates at the sittings center 
on whom to send where. There was an unimaginably desperate 
political-platform duel, for instance, over a problem of great 
moment for Russia -- whom to send as observers for the elections 
in South Africa. It emerged that there were oh so many worthy 
people! Admittedly, we never had the slightest doubt that, in 
our country, every member of the Duma is prepared to assist not 
only de Klerk and Mandela, but also Clinton, and even 'Arafat. 
<H5>  That's the Duma's Lot </H5>
  We do not know how things stand in Rwanda or Burundi, but 
parliamentarians in Russia are under absolutely no threat of 
physical inactivity. We once saw Vladimir Lukin, former Russian 
ambassador to the United States, negotiate 10 stories in 
succession by foot. Then, on the 10th, he suddenly hopped into 
the elevator and, without breathing in (the "Overload" button 
glowed dimly), and pressing himself up against the other 
unbreathing bodies, he went on up to his International Affairs 
Committee on the 24th Floor. Alas, in the former City Hall 
building, the very same trouble is experienced with the 
elevators as with attendance. 
  Just why Duma members are so unenthusiastic about plenary 
sessions is a particular topic of conversation. But an obvious 
guess would be: In running for parliament they were laying 
claim not only, and not necessarily primarily, to the role of 
legislator. For most of them the Duma platform is a useful 
springboard from which to launch themselves into "celebrity 
status" and win popularity. But the Duma denied itself the 
chance of daily televised coverage, which means there is no 
point racing to grab the microphones: Where is the sense in 
pontificating solely for the benefit of fellow deputies and a 
handful of journalists. Surely this explains the fact that even 
some faction leaders -- Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, for instance -- 
have never once delivered incendiary speeches actually inside 
the assembly hall in the entire 100 days, while outside such 
speeches are too numerous to count. 
  Building a political image and maintaining a reputation 
earned requires skilled tactics. And rhetorical speechifying at 
the microphones is not always appropriate here. Incidentally, a 
word about reputation. In the opinion of many Duma members from 
the provinces, it is impossible, even in two years, to break 
into the world of the famous through the powerful armor of the 
capital's monster politicians (faction and party leaders, and 
the Mr. Ministers). This is probably why new shining stars in 
the Duma firmament are hardly even glimmering. 
  On the contrary, another trend is emerging: The provincial 
deputies attack their own electoral districts ever more 
resolutely, getting their governorship and mayorality 
campaigning off to an early start. In point of fact, a new 
political local elite is forming in Moscow. And right here 
there is no shortage of such Duma members. 
  We'll place a small wager -- one in three of those who stand 
for the next elections to local administrative bodies will be 
from among today's Children of the Arbat (the Duma is 
still located on the Arbat, No. 36). They will, of course, have 
powerful competition from the "children of Dmitrovka" (the 
Federation Council is installed at No. 46, Dmitrovka). But 
this, to all intents and purposes, is one and the same group. 
<H5>  Our Conclusion </H5>
  The Duma has not justified the worst expectations. But 
nobody got anywhere near the best. Even for this the Duma 
members are worthy of our recognition. Admittedly, the deputies 
of the current convocation, like their Soviet predecessors, feel 
most painfully every shred of criticism directed at them. But, 
in our view, this vice can be forgiven. The Duma members, it 
seems, do not read the foreign press much. Their colleagues 
abroad frankly have to put up with far more from our foreign 
colleagues. So this infantile disorder of parliamentarism is 
just something you have to go through. 
  That there are very few places where the president and the 
government would place the supreme representative authority in 
the humiliating conditions experienced in Russia is another 
matter. But this is a topic for another article.
