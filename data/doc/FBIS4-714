  [Excerpts] Heavy fighting took place last night in the 
Rwandan capital, Kigali. [passage omitted] The situation is 
confused. Some parts of the city are in the hands of government 
troops, others in the hands of the rebel Patriotic Front or 
civilian militias. 
  Yesterday afternoon more foreigners were evacuated from 
Kigali. They were about a dozen Belgian journalists and around a 
dozen other foreigners. They were flown to Nairobi. Two 
hundred Belgian paratroopers also left. Another dozen or so 
Belgian journalists are still in Kigali. This morning flights 
were delayed by mist. [passage omitted] 
  The Belgian troops under the United Nations have gathered at 
the airport, awaiting a decision from the United Nations 
Security Council and the government to withdraw. 
  Information has also been received of the death of around 30 
Rwandan Red Cross workers and seven UNICEF staff. [passage 
omitted] Supporters of the killed president, Habyarimana, have 
also perpetrated a massacre in a church not far from Kigali. 
Almost 1,200 people were murdered. The majority were children.
