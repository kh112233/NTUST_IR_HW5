U.N. SANCTIONS LIMIT MEDICINE, DOCTOR SAYS 
The U.N. trade embargo is depriving Iraqi civilians, including children, of 
critically needed medical supplies, a U.S. doctor who recently toured the 
region said Monday. 
"We found that sanctions are working, and working brutally, right now," Dr. 
Bernard Lown of the Harvard University School of Public Health said in an 
interview on NBC-TV's "Today" program. 
Baghdad hospitals, including pediatric hospitals, lack insulin, intravenous 
solution and injectable forms of other antibiotics and anesthestics, he said. 
However, the U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, 
allow trade in medicine and some foodstuffs. 
Lown is co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear 
War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985.
