FT  02 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Taking the pain out of cleaning
glass
Nippon Soda of Japan says it has jointly developed a glass that cleans
itself by dissolving dirt and contamination using ultra violet rays as a
catalyst, writes Emiko Terazono. Research was carried out with the
University of Tokyo and a science and technology group backed by the
Kanagawa municipal government.
The process uses titanium dioxide which deodorises and sterilises material
when placed under ultra violet rays from the sun or from a regular
fluorescent room light. A colourless transparent titanium dioxide film on
glass decomposes bacteria and odorous gases. The glass is coated with
silicon film before the titanium dioxide is applied to prevent reaction with
sodium in the glass. Nippon Soda hopes the glass will be used for windows in
buildings and cars.
