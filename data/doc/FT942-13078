FT  27 APR 94 / UK calls for aid shift to private sector
Britain is to push for a restructuring of the World Bank's activities so as
to give a greater role to the International Finance Corporation, the World
Bank affiliate that provides finance for the private sector in developing
countries.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, yesterday hinted that Britain wanted to
discuss transferring resources from the bank to the IFC, so as to reflect
the growing importance of private-sector finance in developing nations.
'Over time, the relative balance between bank lending and IFC investments
will inevitably alter, with IFC growing faster than the bank. We must
explore ways of expanding the IFC's activities without further early calls
on shareholder resources,' he told a meeting yesterday of the development
committee of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
He is concerned that, for every Dollars 19 (Pounds 12.75) provided for
development by the World Bank, the IFC invests only Dollars 1. Britain
believes that the IFC's activities need to be strengthened to build on its
work of providing support for private-sector investment, financial
institutions and capital markets, and on the private provision of
infrastructure and services in developing nations.
The chancellor's concern about World Bank activities was echoed by Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, US treasury secretary. The development committee meeting yesterday
adopted a proposal from Mr Bentsen to create a task force in order to review
the role of the World Bank and other multilateral development banks.
The task force, which has yet to be appointed, will focus on cutting out
overlapping activities. It aims to report by October 1995.
