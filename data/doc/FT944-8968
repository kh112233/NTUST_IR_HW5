FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Tax concession for 'Dutch mixers'
UK multinationals with subsidiaries in the Netherlands through which they
channel US dividends appear to have won a vital concession over their status
ahead of a new income tax treaty.
Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, said an announcement by the US Internal
Revenue Service at a conference of the American Tax Institute could
radically reduce the treaty's impact on UK companies with so-called 'Dutch
mixers'.
The number of multinationals using Dutch mixers is unknown, but Ernst &amp;
Young said it had notified 100 of the IRS statement and was urging them to
apply for tax relief. The accountants estimate that without the IRS
concessions, UK multinationals could have faced doubled tax bills on
dividends from US subsidiaries.
Mr Chuck Merriman, internal tax partner with Ernst &amp; Young, said: 'Although
no blanket relief will be granted by the IRS for all UK mixer companies,
this is certainly a positive indication from the IRS that ruling requests
will be seriously considered.'
The US-Netherlands income tax treaty comes into force on January 1 and is in
part designed to stop 'treaty shopping' by excluding some multinationals
from reaping the benefits of tax concessions.
UK multinationals use Dutch mixers to maximize their UK tax credits by
blending the flow of dividends from overseas subsidiaries which carry
differing levels of tax at source.
Several applications for discretionary relief have been made under Article
26 (7) of the treaty. Mr Merriman said the IRS had indicated that the
results of two cases were near and that they would be favourable to the
applicants.
