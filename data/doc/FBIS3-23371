  [Text] Algiers, March 19 (AFP) -- Gunmen shot dead a 
journalist outside his home in an Islamic stronghold in the 
capital Algiers, the security service press office said Saturday. 
  Djamel Benzaghou, a journalist for a number of years with 
the 
pro-government El Moudajhid and Horizons newspapers, was killed 
early Wednesday in the Bab El Oued district where he lived. 
  Although no group has yet claimed responsibility for the 
killing, Islamic extremists have targeted journalists during 
their insurgency against the secular, military-backed 
authorities.
