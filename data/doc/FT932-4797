FT  08 JUN 93 / World Bank board demands first class
MEMBERS of the World Bank's executive board want to travel first class, in
spite of mounting criticism of the bank staff's lavish benefits, AP-DJ
writes from Washington.
The bank's board is poised to exempt itself from an air travel policy
designed to curb first-class bookings, which it adopted last year, bank
officials say.
The board also recently backed a proposal to spend Dollars 4.7m (Pounds 3m)
on a special air-conditioning system that would let directors smoke in their
offices once the bank had introduced a smoke-free policy.
With the World Bank's headquarters reconstruction project already Dollars
43m over budget, those close to the board say the special air-conditioner is
unlikely to win approval, but the travel exemption, due to be considered
next month, could.
Such action could cause a fiscal backlash in the US Congress, where members
are questioning spending by the World Bank and other institutions.
Senator Jesse Helms, ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, is delaying Senate confirmation of US alternate governors of the
World Bank and four other development banks, while waiting for an air travel
report from the US Treasury.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, has requested reports on travel
policies from the US executive directors at the institutions. The Treasury's
report, expected shortly, is likely to reveal some stark contrasts among the
various development banks, Clinton administration officials say.
A House of Representatives sub-committee has already trimmed by Dollars 200m
the administration's request for funding the US share of a capital
replenishment for the World Bank's concessional loan arm.
The sub-committee sent a stronger signal over its displeasure with the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for lavish spending.
