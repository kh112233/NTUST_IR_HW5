the three Baltic Foreign Ministers with German Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel in Bonn, on Tuesday [8 March], Estonian Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Juri Luik told ETA that Kinkel had clearly 
expressed his support to Estonian aspirations in saying that 
Russian troops have to be gone from Estonia by August 31, 1994 
without any additional conditions. 
  As to other international issues the ministers discussed 
relations of the Baltic states with the European Union [EU]. 
Kinkel expressed hope that the Baltic states would become 
members of EU as quickly as possible, for which talks on the 
free trade agreements should be concluded already at the 
beginning of this summer. 
  Luik said that the meeting had also dwelt upon Estonia's 
relations with other international organizations. In May 
meeting of the Baltic Sea states Foreign Ministers will take 
place in Tallinn, where both Klaus Kinkel and Russian Foreign
