FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The two plums at the top of the trust
tree - Philip Coggan compares the records of collective funds
THE consistent records of two firms of investment managers stand out from
the lists of the top performing unit and investment trusts over the past
decade.
Capel-Cure Asset Management has three unit trusts in the top five (and
another one, Capability Growth, not far behind) while the newly-merged
Henderson Touche Remnant has three investment trusts in the closed-end fund
top five.
Over a 10-year period, equities have traditionally outperformed other
financial investments, such as bonds or cash. When investing in an
equity-based fund such as a unit or investment trust, investors should not
be concentrating on a short-term period such as a year.
Three years is probably the minimum period over which equity investors have
a chance of seeing sufficient capital and dividend growth to overcome the
costs of investment and the risks of a short-term market fall. But the
three-year tables show that the short-term chart toppers are often highly
specialist. Among unit trusts, three of the leaders are based in the Hong
Kong market, which, until recently, had performed very strongly on the back
of hopes for the capitalist development of China.
But only a brave man would predict that Hong Kong funds will top the tables
over the next three years, given the political tensions between the colony
and the mainland.
In the investment trust field, the leaders over three years include two
venture capital funds (one of which, Manakin, is in the process of
liquidating itself); two zero coupon shares (which have benefited from
falling interest rates); and Templeton Emerging Markets, which seeks out the
potential of developing countries in areas such as Latin America and south
east Asia.
The 10-year champions come from the UK equity market (although this is
partly because there were fewer geographical specialist funds in 1983). Most
experts agree that the UK market should be the starting point for the
investor who wants to move into equities.
So how has Capel-Cure managed to produce its long-term success? Kenneth
Levy, who manages both Capability Special Situations and Capability Growth,
follows a strategy which he admits is remarkably similar to that advocated
by Jim Slater in his recent book The Zulu Principle. He looks for companies
which can show positive earnings growth over the past five years and which
have a price-earnings ratio which is attractive relative to the market, a
recent positive statement from the chairman and a strong balance sheet. He
also pays great attention to what is called the 'technical' position (how
the recent share price movements look on the charts) and likes to 'run with
the winners'.
Leonard Klahr, who runs N &amp; P UK Income (which used to be known as Key
Income) and Capability Income &amp; Growth, follows a different high-yield,
contrarian strategy. This was highly successful throughout most of the 1980s
but has run into problems in the past two years as the recession cut into
companies' dividend-paying ability.
Some would argue that 10 years is too long a period on which to judge unit
trusts, since the good performance might have occurred many years ago under
a different manager and thus may not be relevant to current prospects.
As the article 'How to beat the average' on page VI indicates, there is some
evidence that the investor would do well to pick trusts which have been top,
or consistently above average, performers in the past. Both Capability
Special Situations and Capability Growth are in the top quartile (best 25
per cent) of their sector over one, three, five and 10 years, while
Capability Income &amp; Growth is above average in its sector over one, three,
five and 10 years. However, N &amp; P UK Income has been below average over the
three and five-year periods.
The James Capel Income fund has managed to increase its dividend by more
than the rate of inflation for all but two years since it was launched in
1975. The fund aims for a yield equal to around 125 per cent of that on the
FT-A All-Share Index. John Knight, who has managed the fund for the past
three years, says he looks for stocks with the best combination of dividend
yield, growth potential and cash flow. The James Capel fund has a consistent
record with above-average performances in its sector over one, three, five
and ten years.
Two of the top investment trust performers (Law Debenture and TR City of
London) have had the same fund manager for much of the past 10 years  -
Michael Moule. According to TR's Paul Manduca, Moule owes his success to a
concentration on larger companies (small stocks have underperformed over the
past few years), no exposure to the unquoted sector and little investment
overseas in a decade when sterling was relatively strong.
The trust which is top of the tables - Capital Gearing - is a real oddity.
It is small (a market capitalisation of Pounds 8.3m as of January 1),
invests exclusively in the shares of other trusts and has achieved the knack
of standing at a premium to assets (although not at the moment).
The investment trust figures are calculated on a mid-market to mid-market
basis with net income reinvested (unit trust performances, as usual, are
based on offer-to-bid with net income reinvested; all figures from
Micropal). Some would argue that investment trusts are best judged on net
asset value performance, since this measures what the managers have actually
achieved with the portfolio.
But to private investors, it is the return they actually receive which
counts, and taking advantage of narrowing discounts is all part of the skill
of trust investment. Nevertheless, small investors deciding between unit and
investment trusts should realise that the basis for calculations modestly
favours the latter; a mid-market basis does not reflect all the costs of
dealing or indeed income reinvestment. And, of course, discounts can widen
as well as narrow.
