FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Insurers' report leaves cause of death open
A PRELIMINARY report prepared for insurers reaches no conclusions about the
cause of the death of the publisher, Mr Robert Maxwell.
It is understood that the report, which has been drafted by Dr Iain West,
the Guys hospital pathologist, was circulating in the London insurance
market yesterday.
Dr West is working on behalf of a number of insurers who underwrote a Pounds
20m policy insuring against Mr Maxwell's accidental death. The policy will
pay out if Mr Maxwell died accidentally or was murdered. It would not cover
his death from either suicide or natural causes.
Dr West's work has been delayed by his failure to obtain a copy of an
earlier 500 page report prepared by Spanish pathologists. Insurers will base
their decision on Dr West's final report which he is expected to complete
after studying the conclusions of the Spanish document. The burden of proof
is on the Maxwell companies that took out the policy and are the
beneficiaries.
Dr West was a member of a team of British and Isareli doctors who performed
an autopsy on Mr Maxwell in Israel. He has dismissed claims by the magazine
Paris Match that a video tape of the autopsy showed Mr Maxwell had been
beaten before he died.
Mr Carlos Lopez de Lamela, director of the Las Palmas Forensic Institute who
was part of the Spanish team who did the first autopsy, said yesterday that
he totally rejected any suggestion that Mr Maxwell had sustained injuries.
