FT  19 AUG 93 / Maxwell policy writ issued
THE ADMINISTRATORS to the companies formerly owned by Robert Maxwell have
begun legal proceedings against insurers that are refusing to settle a
policy on the life of the publisher.
A writ has been issued seeking payment of more than Pounds 10m on a personal
accident policy taken out for Mr Maxwell by four companies.
The companies are Maxwell Communication Corporation, Mirror Group
Newspapers, and two businesses within the private empire, Robert Maxwell
Group and Headington Investments.
The writ and statement of claim lodged in the High Court name more than a
dozen companies including several UK large composite insurers.
The move follows a breakdown in discussions for a compromise out-of-court
settlement without an acceptance of liability by all the insurers involved
which would have generated Pounds 6.5m.
Just over half of the insurers involved agreed to the settlement, which has
led to payments so far of about Pounds 3.5m. Those now being sued are being
pursued for their share of the value of the gross claim, which was Pounds
20m.
The insurers have argued that if Maxwell was assassinated or committed
suicide, his policy would be void.
Under a recent tentative agreement - subject to final approval by creditors'
committees - MCC and MGN will each receive about one third of the proceeds
of the policy, and the two private companies will take the remainder, which
will be divided equally between them.
