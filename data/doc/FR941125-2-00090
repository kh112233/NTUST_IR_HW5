SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 
Purpose and Background: 


The fee schedule for sanitation inspections of passenger cruise ships currently inspected under the Vessel Sanitation
Program (VSP) was first published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 24, 1987 (52 FR 45019), and CDC began collecting fees on March 1, 1988. Since then, CDC has revised the fee
schedule annually. This notice announces fees effective January 1, 1995. 
The formula used to determine the fees is as follows: 







<IMPORT>



E:GraphicsEN25no94.009





</IMPORT>





Average cost per inspection = Total Cost of VSP Weighted No. of Annual Inspections 
The average cost per inspection is multiplied by a size/cost factor to determine the fee for vessels in each size category.
The size/cost factor was established in the proposed fee schedule published in the 

Federal Register

 on July 17, 1987 (52 FR 27060), and revised in a schedule published in the 

Federal Register

 on November 28, 1989 (54 FR 48942). The revised cost/factor is presented below in Appendix A. 


Fees 


The fee schedule is presented in Appendix A and will be effective January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1995. However,
should there be a substantial increase in the cost of air transportation, it may be necessary to re-adjust the fees
prior to December 31, 1995, since travel constitutes a sizable portion of the costs of this program. If such a re-adjustment
in the fee schedule is necessary, a notice will be published in the 

Federal Register

 30 days prior to the effective date. 


Applicability 


The fees will be applicable to all passenger cruise vessels for which sanitation inspections are conducted as part
of the Vessel Sanitation Program, CDC. 



Dated: November 17, 1994.
