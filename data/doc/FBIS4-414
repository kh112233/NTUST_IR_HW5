  [Text] The international aid effort in Liberia continues to 
be hampered by the activities of rebel groups. Last week, 
several aid agencies including the French charity, Medecins Sans 
Frontieres, or MSF, accused the Liberian Peace Council of 
murdering two nurses in Grand Bassa County, and they expressed 
concern for the lack of respect being shown for humanitarian 
efforts. Well, today, the Liberian Peace Council's secretary 
general, Octavius Walker, called us up from Monrovia, and he 
told Josephine Hazely that he objected to the claim that they 
had been involved in the killing of the two MSF workers. 
  [Begin recording] [Walker] Sorry, it is not true. It is just 
designed to spoil the good reputation of the Liberian Peace 
Council. Since the war started, we have never killed any 
civilians. We have never killed any civilians, so when the 
story came out I went to the Medecins sans Frontieres office in 
Monrovia and their director showed me a copy of the release that 
(?reported it). They told me that it was a local newspaper that 
accused the Peace Council of killing the two nurses. But 
according to the release, no faction's name was mentioned. In 
fact, on that particular day, the Liberia Peace Council and the 
NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] fought so they do not 
know exactly which faction killed the two nurses. 
  [Hazely] But it is a bit superfluous for you to say since 
the 
war started you have not killed any civilians, is it not? 
  [Walker] I can prove it, yes, it is true. We have never 
killed any civilians. Even if the NPFL fighters surrender to 
us, we do not kill them. 
  [Hazely] Why are you so sure that you did not kill the two 
male nurses of Medecins sans Frontieres? After all, you were 
fighting, it could have been you. 
  [Walker] I am sure my boys....[pauses] In fact we are 
fighting a professional fight. We do not shoot when NPFL are 
shooting at us. We wait till they are tired before we attack 
them. So my boys are professionals and I trust them. 
  [Hazely] Our reports say these two aid workers were killed 
at 
Compound No. 2. Now, who controls Compound No. 2? 
  [Walker] The Liberian Peace Council presently controls 
Compound No. 2. 
  [Hazely] Well, so, there you are. You could have killed 
them. 
  [Walker] No way. We took over 6,000 civilians from that camp 
and turned them over to ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] in Bassa. We have 
never killed any civilians. 
  [Hazely] All right, then. The aid agencies were generally 
complaining about the manner in which you are harassing and 
making their work completely difficult in Grand Bassa, where you 
are. Now why are you preventing the aid agencies from operating 
normally? 
  [Walker] For the aid agencies now going to our territory, 
they and myself are now negotiating. For the past two weeks, 
they have been inviting us to meetings and they went to my 
chairman, Dr. George Foley, and we have worked out modalities. 
Just on the 29th of last month, March, we (?carried) ECOMOG 
chief of staff with other members of the (?High Command) of 
ECOMOG. We went to Rivercess, and our territory and they saw 
the whole area, so we are working out modalities for the 
Medecins sans Frontieres to go and start their work. 
  [Hazely] Well, okay. Have you or have you not been stopping 
aid agencies from working in your areas? 
  [Walker] We have never stopped anybody. They came to us to 
talk to us to allow them to go in. We have never [words 
indistinct] those modalities yet. [end recording]
