  [Text] The ANC leader, Nelson Mandela, has pledged to back 
a tax system favorable to investment in South Africa, saying he 
won't seize privately owned land for redistribution. Mr. 
Mandela said the country needed massive resources, including 
foreign capital, to rebuild the economy. He said he expected 
foreign capital, much of it from the United States, to play a 
vital if not decisive role in helping to rebuild the South 
African economy. 
  The ANC leader added that he believed the four days of 
voting 
last week had been free and fair, despite some problems that he 
said would not affect the outcome.
