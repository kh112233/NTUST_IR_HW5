SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 4B4416) has been filed by Shell Oil Co., One Shell Plaza, P.O. Box 4320, Houston, TX 77210. The
petition proposes to amend the food additive regulations in 175.250 

Paraffin (synthetic)

 (21 CFR 175.250) to incorporate broadened specifications for congealing point and oil content for synthetic paraffinic
waxes produced by the Fischer-Tropsch process to more closely resemble specifications for other synthetic paraffin
waxes permitted for use in food packaging under other regulations.
 


The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act, (40 CFR 1501.4 (b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before May
18, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and
4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will also place on public display any amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's
environmental assessment without further announcement in the 

Federal Register

. If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition
results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the 

Federal Register

 in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).
