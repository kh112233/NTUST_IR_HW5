<F P=106> [Report by Salah Ni'mat: "Jordanian Sources Cast Doubt on </F>
Trial of Defendants Suspected of Blowing Up Trade Center"] 
  [Excerpt] Amman -- Official Jordanian sources yesterday 
cast doubt on the proceedings at the trial of the four 
defendants convicted of blowing up the World Trade Center in New 
York. They said that the jury's decision to convict the four 
defendants on all the charges leveled at them "was based on a 
weak argument and conflicting testimonies that do not rise to 
the level of legal evidence." 
  A source who followed the proceedings of the trial in New 
York told AL-HAYAH that the prosecution in the case, 
representing the U.S. Government, "based its argument on 
circumstantial evidence and a group of unlinked events" in an 
endeavor to convict Muhammad Salamah and Nidal 'Ayyad 
(Jordanians of Palestinian origin) and Mahmud Abu-Halimah and 
Ahmad 'Ajjaj. The source added that the prosecution "reached 
its conclusion about the defendants' implication by producing 
evidence and testimonies that do not rise to the level of 
irrefutable evidence." [passage omitted]
