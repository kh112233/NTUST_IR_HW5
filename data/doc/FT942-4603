FT  09 JUN 94 / Jordan seeks to line up a cabinet for peace: Move to heal
rift with parliament
Jordan yesterday announced a big cabinet reshuffle, in the wake of progress
in the kingdom's peace talks with Israel, in which nearly all the main
political parties, apart from the Islamists, were given posts.
The changes to 16 portfolios were aimed at closing the gap between the
government and parliament, which have had a fractious relationship since
parliamentary elections in November 1993. The key portfolios of information,
foreign affairs and finance were not, however, affected.
But by appointing a number of MPs to cabinet posts Mr Abdel Salam al-Majali,
the prime minister, had hoped to soften rising dissatisfaction against his
policies of peace and economic adjustment in the lower house.
A number of leading politicians including members of the fundamentalist
Islamic Action Front (IAF), nevertheless refused to join.
The IAF, which holds the largest bloc of 16 seats in the 80-member
parliament, is opposed to Jordan's participation in the peace process which
has reached a crucial stage.
On Tuesday, Jordan agreed with Israel to push ahead with items on its common
agenda, signed in Washington last year. If successful this may include
resolving key issues such as territorial and water disputes over the next
few months.
Mr Jawad Anani, the Jordanian information minister, said that as a result of
new developments in the peace process, Jordan must 'mobilise all our
energies and unite'.
The regime's failure to persuade the Islamists and other influential figures
to join the government, however, is likely to mean that tension between
parliament and cabinet will continue. Despite this, King Hussein said he was
pleased with the new government and hoped that the Lower House and cabinet
would work together constructively towards peace.
