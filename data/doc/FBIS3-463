  [Text] Spoornet [rail network] has confirmed that an 
official investigation has been ordered into this morning's 
train accident at Marianhill, north of Durban, in which at least 
90 people were killed and 52 critically injured. The accident 
happened when a commuter train headed for Durban was derailed 
between Thornwood and Marianhill. Cranes are being used to free 
people trapped between coaches and the police, the air force, 
and the army are helping with the rescue operation. 
  Several survivors told reporters that they had been 
threatened by the train driver, who told them that he was a 
member of the right-wing group. The police asked witnesses to 
submit sworn statements and it has been reported that the driver 
has undergone a blood test. 
  Both the ANC [African National Congress] and King Goodwill 
Zwelithini of the Zulus have extended their condolences to the 
families of the victims and have asked that a disaster fund be 
established.
