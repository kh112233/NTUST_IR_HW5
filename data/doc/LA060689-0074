S.F. LAW RECOGNIZES UNMARRIED PARTNERS 
San Francisco became the first city in the country Monday to grant official 
public recognition to homosexual and unmarried heterosexual couples. 
Mayor Art Agnos signed the landmark law, calling it "one of the most important 
milestones in San Francisco's effort to adopt policies to recognize the 
diversity of families and to extend to all people in our city the basic human 
right to form families of their choice." 
Agnos also appointed a "Task Force on Family Policy" to determine guidelines 
for allowing unmarried city workers to add partners, adult children and 
extended family members to the city's health plan. 
Though denounced by leaders of the city's Roman Catholic Church as an attack on 
marriage and the traditional family, the new law won the unanimous support of 
the Board of Supervisors before going to Agnos for his signature.
