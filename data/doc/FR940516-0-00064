SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of February 16, 1994 (59 FR 7636) (effective date corrected in the 

Federal Register

 of February 22, 1994 (59 FR 8507)), FDA amended 21 CFR 74.1101 and 74.2101 to provide for the safe use of FDC Blue
No. 1 and FDC Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake for coloring drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye.


FDA gave interested persons until March 18, 1994, to file written objections or requests for a hearing. The agency
received no objections or requests for a hearing on the final rule. Therefore, FDA has concluded that the final rule
published in the 

Federal Register

 of February 16, 1994, should be confirmed as corrected on February 22, 1994.
