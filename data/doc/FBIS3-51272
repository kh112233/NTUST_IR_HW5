  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 17 Jan (AFP) -- Police have told 
AFP that an FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) 
guerrilla column consisting of approximately 250 men mercilessly 
occupied Florian, southwest of Santander Department, early 
today. The rebels killed two policemen, wounded a 
noncommissioned officer and another two agents and robbed a bank. 
  In a telephone call to Bucaramanga, the departmental 
capital, 
the police added that the attack was executed by subversives of 
the FARC's 23d Front who destroyed the local garrison but did 
not harm civilians. 
  Florian is located 300 km from Bucaramanga. The town woke up 
in a panic due to bullet noises from the two sides, the police 
command stated, adding that the municipality was already back to 
normal this afternoon. 
  According to the report, there were nine policemen and a 
noncommissioned officer stationed in the town. They responded 
to the rebel fire for six hours until they ran out of ammunition. 
  The guerrillas attacked the garrison with fragmentation 
grenades and mortar fire. After the policemen ran out of 
bullets, the rebels stole their weapons, which included seven 
rifles, two carbines, several revolvers, and three shotguns. 
  Prior to leaving for the mountains of Santander, a farming 
and cattle-breeding region 420 km from Bogota, the guerrillas 
dynamited the local bank's safe-deposit box and took the money 
that was deposited there.
