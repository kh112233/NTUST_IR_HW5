REPORT ACCUSES ROSE OF BETTING ON REDS' GAMES 
A special investigator's report to major league baseball on Pete Rose's alleged 
gambling, made public Monday by a Cincinnati judge, accuses the Cincinnati 
Reds' manager of betting not only on major league games but on his own team's 
games as well, from 1985 to 1987. 
Lawyers for Rose won a temporary restraining order Sunday, preventing baseball 
from conducting a hearing with Rose -- one was scheduled for today -- until at 
least July 6. 
But the Ohio Supreme Court, responding to a suit filed Monday by the Cleveland 
Plain Dealer, ordered Judge Norbert A. Nadel of Hamilton County Common Pleas 
Court to release the report or explain why. Nadel, the same judge who Sunday 
had issued the temporary restraining order, complied reluctantly with the 
court's order. 
The 225-page report, compiled after a four-month investigation by baseball 
investigator John M. Dowd, implicates Rose as having gambled extensively on 
baseball and Reds' games. 
"The testimony and the documentary evidence gathered in the course of the 
investigation demonstrates that Pete Rose bet on baseball, and, in particular, 
on games of the Cincinnati Reds baseball club, during the 1985, 1986 and 1987 
seasons," Dowd wrote in the report. 
A key element in the report is the transcript of Dowd's interview with Ron 
Peters, an Ohio bookmaker with whom Rose allegedly placed baseball bets of up 
to $2,000 a game. 
The exchange: 
Dowd: And when he bet baseball, did he bet on the Cincinnati Reds? 
Peters: Yes, he did. 
Dowd: And this was at a time that he was manager of the Cincinnati Reds? 
Peters: Yes, sir. 
Dowd: Is there any doubt in your mind? 
Peters: Absolutely not. 
Peters pleaded guilty recently to charges of tax evasion and conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine. 
Whether Rose bet on Reds' games is the critical element in the case, since 
gambling on one's own baseball team has traditionally carried a lifetime ban 
from the sport. Eight members of the Chicago White Sox were given lifetime bans 
in the wake of revelations that gamblers had rigged the 1919 World Series. 
Paul Janszen of Cincinnati, who was serving a six-month sentence for tax 
evasion when the report was compiled but who has since been released, testified 
that he placed baseball bets for Rose with Peters from April 17, 1987, through 
May 13, 1987. 
The report details specific incidents, described by Janszen, of Rose placing 
bets with Tommy Gioiosa, a one-time house guest of Rose, on the 1986 National 
League playoffs between the New York Mets and Houston Astros. 
Rose, since the investigation began, has admitted betting on other sports but 
had denied throughout that he ever bet on baseball games. 
The report also shows that during his deposition, Rose was shown gambling 
sheets, which investigators allege show Rose bet on baseball games, and that 
expert analysis showed the sheets were in Rose's handwriting. Rose has denied 
the writing was his. 
Another section describes Gioiosa's paying Peters $24,000 in Rose's alleged 
gambling debts at a cafe in Franklin, Ohio, in 1986. Peters recalled Gioiosa 
bringing him three $8,000 checks, all payable to cash and signed by Rose. 
Peters, according to testimony, told Gioiosa to cash the checks because he did 
not want his name on them. Gioiosa then cashed the checks and paid Peters in 
cash. 
Dowd wrote in the report that Peters' recollection of the incident is supported 
by Rose's own bank records. 
Rose is also accused in the report by Janszen of placing bets in New York and 
using Michael Bertolini of New York as his runner. 
Janszen said that Rose "within a three-month period of time . . . was in debt 
over $400,000 to the bookie in New York via Mike Bertolini, in baseball betting 
alone." 
Rose denied ever placing bets with Bertolini.
