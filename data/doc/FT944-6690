FT  29 NOV 94 / Turkish foreign minister quits
The Turkish foreign minister, Mr Mumtaz Soysal, resigned yesterday over a
dispute with prime minister Tansu Ciller on the appointment of his
assistant. The Anatolian news agency said Mrs Ciller had accepted the
resignation, but the foreign ministry made no announcement. Mr Soysal, a
member of the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrat People's party,
had resisted appointing Mrs Ciller's hand-picked candidate as his deputy
since he was named foreign minister during a cabinet reshuffle in July. Mr
Soysal has also clashed with Mrs Ciller on the issue of privatisation and
had pushed for an amendment in the anti-terrorism law, which gives officials
wide latitude to declare writings and speeches terrorist propaganda. Mr
Soysal, 65, spent more than 14 months in jail in the early 1970s under the
military regime on charges of making Communist propaganda, and has been a
university lecturer on constitutional law and a deputy president of Amnesty
International. His strong nationalist stance won him few friends in foreign
capitals. Mr Soysal has been particularly vocal in the row with Greece over
territorial waters in the Aegean Sea.
