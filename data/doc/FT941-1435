FT  25 MAR 94 / Teachers to lodge part-timer pay claims
Thousands of part-time teachers are preparing to lodge retrospective
compensation claims against local authorities in the light of the recent
House of Lords ruling on part-time workers, the National Union of Teachers
said yesterday.
The ruling, based on European law, found that the qualifying period for
unfair dismissal protection and redundancy pay for part-timers should be the
same as full-timers - two years instead of the current five.
The NUT said those who lost their jobs without the compensation the ruling
requires would be urged to claim. It said that claims had to be lodged
before June 3.
Other employers, particularly retailers and local authorities, could face
expensive retrospective compensation claims from tens of thousands of
part-time workers dismissed since 1976.
