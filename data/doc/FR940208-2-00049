<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is no longer contemplating the grant of an exclusive license in the
United States to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Number 4,797,368 (SN 06/712,236), entitled ``Adeno-Associated
Virus As Eukaryotic Expression Vector'' to Theragen, Inc., of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Based upon written evidence and
argument received in response to a 

Federal Register

 notice (Vol. 57, No. 169, Monday, August 31, 1992, page 39405), the NIH has established that the grant of the license
would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7 and that U.S. Patent 4,797,368 should
be licensed on a non-exclusive basis for the field of gene therapy. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned
to the United States of America.





The patent describes a novel expression vector based on the parvovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), which is valuable
for the stable maintenance or expression of DNA sequences or genes in eukaryotic cells. The use of many previously
available virus-based eukaryotic expression vectors has been limited because they do not integrate foreign DNA
into the host genome at high frequency and are not easily rescued from their host. This AAV-based expression vector
is easily rescued from the host and allows the host to express the foreign DNA or genes at high frequency.
