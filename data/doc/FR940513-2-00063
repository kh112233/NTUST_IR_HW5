Notice of adoption of standards.






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY: 

The purpose of this notice is to announce the adoption of a family of Federal Telecommunications Standards (FEDSTDs).
FEDSTD 1055, ``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements for Meteor Burst Radio Communications
Between Conventional Master and Remote Stations,'' FEDSTD 1056, ``Telecommunications: Interoperability
Requirements for the Encryption of Meteor Burst Radio Communications,'' and FEDSTD 1057, ``Telecommunications:
Interoperability Requirements for Meteor Burst Radio Communications Between Networks by Conventional Master
Stations'' are approved and will be published.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

(1) The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible, under the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative
Services Act of 1949, as amended, for the Federal Standardization Program. On August 14, 1972, the Administrator
of GSA designated the National Communications System (NCS) as the responsible agent for the development of telecommunications
standards for interoperability of U.S. Government communications systems.




(2) On April 7, 1992, a notice was published in the 

Federal Register

 (57 FR 11731) that proposed FEDSTD 1055 entitled ``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements
for Meteor Burst Radio Communications Between Conventional Master and Remote Stations''; FEDSTD 1056 entitled
``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements for the Encryption of Meteor Burst Radio Communications;''
and FEDSTD 1057 entitled ``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements for Meteor Burst Radio Communications
Between Networks by Conventional Master Stations'' were being proposed for Federal use and that comments were requested.
(3) The justification package as approved by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Defense-wide C3), Office
of the Assistant Secretary of Defense was presented to GSA by NCS with a recommendation for adoption of the standards.
These data are a part of the public record and are available for inspection and copying at the Office of Technology and
Standards, National Communications System, Washington, DC 203052010.
(4) A copy of each standard is provided as an attachment to this notice. Interested parties may purchase the standard
from GSA, acting as agent for the Superintendent of Documents. Copies are for sale at the GSA Federal Supply Service
Bureau (FSSB), Specifications Section, suite 8100, 490 East L'Enfant Plaza, SW., Washington, DC 20407; telephone
(202) 7550325.

Federal Standards 1055, 1056, and 1057 Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements for Meteor Burst Communications




1. Scope.

 The terms and accompanying definitions contained in these standards are drawn from authoritative U.S. Government
sources such as the Department of Defense and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and
several authoritative U.S. Government publications. The Meteor Burst Communications Subcommittee to the Federal
Telecommunications Standards Committee (FTSC) has developed a family of technical specifications for use by systems
that use meteor trails as the primary mechanism for communications.
1.2.

 Applicability.

 All Federal departments and agencies shall use Federal Standards FEDSTD 1055, ``Telecommunications: Interoperability
Requirements for Meteor Burst Radio Communications Between Conventional Master and Remote Stations,'' FEDSTD
1056, ``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements for the Encryption of Meteor Burst Radio Communications,''
and FEDSTD 1057, ``Telecommunications: Interoperability Requirements for meteor Burst Radio Communications
Between Networks by Conventional Master Stations'' in the design and procurement of all Meteor Burst Communication
equipment to be used on Government authorized radio frequencies, except for (1) Equipment used for remote sensing
applications; (2) equipment employing spread spectrum modulation; (3) equipment that dynamically changes data
rate during meteor trails. The use of these standards by all Federal departments and agencies is mandatory.
1.2. 

Purpose.

 The purpose of this standard is to improve the Federal acquisition process by providing Federal departments and agencies
with a comprehensive, authoritative source for meteor burst communications.
2. 

Requirements and Applicable Documents.

 The radio characteristics, modulation, data rates, and message broadcast procedures and format defined in these
standards are to be applied to the design and procurement of meteor burst communications equipment. These are a family
of Federal Telecommunications Standards and each contains a list of other Federal standards that may be applicable
to implementation of these standards.
3. 

Use.

 All Federal departments and agencies shall use these standards in the design and procurement of meteor burst communication
equipment. Only after determining that a requirement is not included in these documents may other sources be used.
4. 

Effective Date.

 The use of these approved standards by U.S. Government departments and agencies is mandatory, effective 180 days
following the publication date of this standard.
5. 

Changes.

 When a Federal department or agency considers that these standards do not provide for its essential needs, a statement
citing inadequacies shall be sent in duplicate to the General Services Administration, Regulations Analysis Division
(KMR), Washington, DC 20405, in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Information Resources Management
Regulation, Subpart 20120.3. The General Services Administration will determine the appropriate action
to be taken and will notify the agency. Federal departments and agencies are encouraged to submit updates and corrections
to these standards, which will be considered for the next revision of this standard. The General Services Administration
has delegated the compilation of suggested changes to the National Communications System whose address is given
below: Office of the Manager, National Communications System, Office of Techonolgy and Standards, Washington,
DC 203052010.
