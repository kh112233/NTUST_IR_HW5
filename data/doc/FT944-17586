FT  07 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Sparing cats the unkindest cut
A vaccine for neutering male cats has been developed that could avoid the
trauma of surgical castration. The vaccine, which was designed by Proteus
International, a specialist in computer-aided drug design, has undergone
trials which shows that it stops sperm production and reduces testosterone
levels in tom cats.
The vaccine interferes with the action of GnRH, a hormone which stimulates
the pituitary gland to produce hormones that trigger the production of
testosterone. It uses an analogue of GnRH which stimulates an immune
response that prevents GnRH from stimulating the pituitary gland.
Further tests are being conducted to examine how long the vaccine lasts and
whether its effects can be reversed. Proteus, which is in talks with a
number of potential partners, believes its use could be extended to neuter
female cats, dogs and cattle.
