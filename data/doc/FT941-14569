FT  20 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Japanese drug production falls
Japanese domestic pharmaceuticals production registered its first fall in
seven years during 1992, according to the latest data published by the Japan
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. The trade body blamed government
imposed price cuts and distribution system reforms for the 2.2 per cent fall
to Y5,574bn (Pounds 33.3bn).
The growing strength of overseas groups in Japan and the continuing
international weakness of Japanese companies helped the country register the
world's largest trade deficit in medicines during 1992, worth Y246.8bn.
Exports increased 15.5 per cent to Y183.3bn.
The largest export market was the US, worth Y41bn, followed by Germany
(Y17.9bn), Belgium (Y15bn), China (Y14bn), France (Y13bn), South Korea
(Y11bn), and Italy (Y10.7bn).
Only four Japanese companies generated more than 10 per cent of their sales
overseas during the year to March 1993. These were Yamanouchi (29 per cent),
Fujisawa (24.5 per cent), Tanabe (17.7 per cent) and Takeda (10.2 per cent).
Imports rose 4.3 per cent to Y430bn. Germany was the largest importer
generating sales of Y106bn, followed by the US (Y80bn), the UK (Y48bn),
Switzerland (Y46bn) and Sweden (Y26bn).
Japanese drugs groups have also been investing heavily in research and
development during recent years with the aim of creating world-class
medicines. In 1992 they spent Y590bn on R&amp;D, an increase of 14.3 per cent on
the previous year. Smaller companies accounted for most of the rise. Ten
years ago Japanese groups invested only Y239bn on R&amp;D.
