  [Text] Beijing, March 6 (AFP)--Chinese police detained 
1989 pro-democracy movement student leader Zhai Weimin on Sunday 
[6 March], continuing a crackdown on dissidents ahead of the US 
secretary of state's visit this week. A friend of Zhai said by 
telephone that the dissident, who was sixth on the government's 
"most wanted list" following the 1989 Tiananmen massacre, was 
picked up at 2:40 p.m. (0640 GMT) by four policemen driving a 
red Volkswagen Santana as he walked along a street in Beijing's 
university area. The dissident was released from jail on 
September 13, after serving a 3-1/2 year term for 
"counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement." 
  Chinese police have detained at least eight political 
activists in recent days, including Wei Jingsheng, the country's 
most famous dissident. Wei was released Saturday after spending 
more than 24 hours being interrogated on the northern outskirts 
of Beijing. He returned home late Saturday. "This is all part 
of the same thing as Wei," said Zhai's friend, who saw the 
dissident being taken away by car. "It's still going on, it's 
not over. They release some, but they keep on detaining others."
