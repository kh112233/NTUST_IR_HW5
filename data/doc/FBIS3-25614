  [Text] Kigali, 23 Feb (AFP) -- Tribal clashes in the 
Rwandan capital claimed several dozen civilian lives overnight, 
relief officials said Wednesday [23 February] as preparations 
went ahead to swear in transitional authorities to end ethnic 
conflict. Government officials gave no toll from the fighting, 
which followed the murder late Monday of Public Works Minister 
Felicien Gatabazi, a Hutu from the southern town of Butare, and 
the revenge lynching of radical Hutu leader Martin Bucyana. 
  Witnesses said they heard gunfire, and that former rebels of 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) soldiers, who are 
predominantly Tutsi, were fighting residents of the majority 
Hutu tribe in Kigali. A spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission 
for Rwanda said however that its troops always accompanied RPF 
men, and he could not confirm that former rebels were involved 
in armed incidents. Humanitarian agency sources said there had 
probably been casualties in what they described as "very 
localised" clashes, but most of the capital was calm, they added.
