FT  10 JUN 93 / Arts: Today's Television
With so many people these days calling themselves 'consultants' it is
interesting to be able to watch one who manages to charge Pounds 4,000 a
day. Business Matters considers the service offered by Michael
Hartley-Brewer, a negotiation consultant who trains executives such as those
in the Irish division of the computer company Hewlett Packard (7.30 BBC2).
Mavis Nicholson presents the first of eight programmes called Moment Of
Crisis (8.00 C4). The first subject is Annie Maguire who, in 1976, was sent
to prison for allegedly playing a part in the Guildford pub bombing. It took
nine years and four months for her conviction to be quashed. Her daughter
Annemarie was nine when Mrs Maguire was imprisoned. The two women talk about
the effect it still has on their lives. ITV begins a three-part crime drama
set in Wales: Telltale (9.00). The over-used Bernard Hill plays a detective
who becomes involved with a supergrass. True Stories (9.35 C4) investigates
the sort of animals on sale in Moscow's Bird Market. Under The Sun (9.35
BBC2) looks at'fraternal polyandry' in Nepal.
