  [Text] HANOI, May 20 (AFP) -- Vietnam is building a second 
lighthouse in the hotly-contested Spratlys archipelago in the 
South China Sea, the communist party's NHAN DAN newspaper said 
Friday. 
  The lighthouse going up on Da Tay island, 450 kilometers 
(280 
miles) from the Vietnam coast, will stand 20 meters (65 feet) 
high and cover an area of 25 kilometers (15 miles), the daily 
said. It illustrated its report with a photograph of Vietnamese 
workers at the site with incoming construction materials. 
  Vietnam built its first lighthouse in the Spratlys last 
October on Son Tu Tay island, in the northeast part of the 
far-flung archipelago, about 560 kilometers (350 miles) from the 
mainland naval base of Cam Ranh Bay. Standing 36 meters (120 
feet) high, it was fitted with radar. 
  Sovereignty over the Spratlys, which lie along strategic sea 
lanes and are supposedly rich in oil deposits, is disputed 
chiefly by China and Vietnam, with Brunei, Malaysia, the 
Philippines and Taiwan also making claims. 
  In charge of building the second lighthouse, requiring 6,500 
tonnes of material, is a company belonging to the Vietnamese 
government's civilian maritime affairs department. Work began 
last August, and is scheduled to be finished by the end of the 
year, an official of the department told AFP in Hanoi.
