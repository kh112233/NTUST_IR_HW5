FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (13): Fresh hope for Afro-optimists - Analysis /
Afro-optimists hope that a thriving post-apartheid South Africa will be the
engine of growth that will haul the ailing economies of the region out of
their protracted slump
In spite of the optimism over the long-term trade prospects for South
Africa, Afro-pessimists point to the enormity of the challenge facing the
region. African countries' GDP growth last year (excluding South Africa) was
1.4 per cent, according to the 1994 World Bank annual report - better than
1992, but still well below the region's population growth rate.
Whatever the outcome, no one under-estimates South Africa's dominant role in
the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, strikingly illustrated by one yardstick:
export credit guarantees extended to Pretoria, since Nelson Mandela's
inauguration, exceed the total cover available to other countries in the
region.
Whether trade opportunities are indeed going to pick up north of the Limpopo
depends on which analysts you believe; and the analysts assessment may well
be influenced by what they wish to sell.
For brokers extolling the merits of the dozen or so investment funds which
have identified Africa as an emerging market whose time has come, prospects
seem almost rosy.
'Out of the starting blocks' reads the caption on the cover of a bullish
analysis of sub-Saharan stock markets published last month.*
Vast commodity reserves and low cost production, privatisation getting under
way, and the easing or lifting of foreign exchange controls are features
noted elsewhere in the report.
But before the exporter to Africa sends out a sales team, a distinctly more
cautious comment should be taken into account.
'Small markets with low growth rates, poor infrastructure, high
indebtedness, slow progress in introducing market and private sector
orientated economic reforms, and low levels of technological capabilities,
all reduce the attractiveness of many African countries to foreign
investors,' says the recent 1994 World Investment Report.**
Neither the stock market nor foreign investment level are in themselves
adequate guide to the state of the African market: as much as half of the
region's imports may be aid financed, and aid flows have been rising. But
the comments of the Investment Report may serve as a useful indicator, for
higher levels of foreign investment are essential to Africa's economic
recovery.
Despite the reforms that got under way in many African countries during the
1980s, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows did not increase between the
second half of the 1980s and early 1990s, notes the report.
Averaging around Dollars 3bn a year, FDI flows to the entire region were
considerably less than those received by Malaysia in the early 1990s, it
points out.
Inflows are concentrated in oil exporting countries, notably Egypt, Angola
and Nigeria. Although the total value of FDI flows into Africa nearly
doubled from an annual average of Dollars 1.7bn during 1981-85, to an
average of almost Dollars 3bn during 1986-90, says the study, those
investments were concentrated in few countries, and modest when compared to
FDI flows to other regions of the developing world.
Average annual FDI flows into Africa as a proportion of all inflows in
developing countries declined between these two periods from 13 per cent to
11 per cent.
Worse was to come. Flows stagnated in the early 1990s to many African
countries, while flows to other developing countries continued to increase.
'As a result, Africa's share decined further to 6 per cent by 1992, thus
underlining the marginalisation of that continent in relation to FDI, apart
from its marginalisation in relation to international trade.'
Africa's reforms may have got it out of the starting blocks, but it has
several laps to go, it seems, before it breasts the finishing tape.
