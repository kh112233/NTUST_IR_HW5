  [Text] Pretoria Feb 18 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister 
Hernus Kriel has condemned the PAC's [Pan-Africanist Congress] 
youth wing for its reference on Thursday [17 February] to 
"killing a journalist", saying it would undoubtedly be 
interpreted as encouragement by some members of the organisation 
to do just that. 
  Mr Kriel said the statement, made by Azanian Youth Unity 
National Chairman Mosotho Petlane, was a direct threat to the 
freedom of the press and to democracy itself. "(It) will 
undoubtedly be interpreted by many PAC supporters as direct 
enouragement to murder journalists, who have already on a number 
of occasions been attacked by PAC supporters." 
  Alleging bias by the media, and particularly the SABC [South 
African Broadcasting Corporation], against the PAC, Mr Petlane 
said on Thursday: "We would like the media to advise us on what 
we must do. Must we kill one journalist before we get fair 
coverage? Or must we demand a PAC volkstaat [homeland]? Or 
must we threaten a civil war?" 
  Mr Kriel said in reply to this that he was himself concerned 
about bias by the SABC "at the expense of all except the ANC 
[African National Congress)...(but) it must be realised that no 
free and fair election is possible without a media free of both 
direct and indirect intimidation".
