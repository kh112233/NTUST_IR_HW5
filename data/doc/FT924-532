FT  24 DEC 92 / Dollars 25m damages over implants
A Texas jury awarded Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.4m) in damages yesterday to a
Houston woman who said silicone-gel breast implants caused an autoimmune
disease after rupturing inside her, Reuter reports from Houston.
Pamela Johnson won the award against Medical Engineering, a subsidiary of
Bristol-Myers Squibb, after claiming silicone leaked from two sets of
implants, attacked her immune system and caused various illnesses, forcing
her to have a partial mastectomy. Bristol-Myers Squibb, whose stock fell
Dollars 3.125 to Dollars 68.125 after the ruling, plans an appeal.
