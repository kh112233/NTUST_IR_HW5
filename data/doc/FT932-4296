FT  10 JUN 93 / UK seeks easing of poor countries' debt
THE UK is seeking to ease the official debt burden of the poorest, most
heavily indebted countries, by extending the scope of the so-called Trinidad
terms.
Mr Anthony Nelson, UK economic secretary, said yesterday he would visit
Washington shortly to urge members of the US administration and Congress to
back an international consensus on the terms which, when fully implemented,
imply a one-off cut of up to two thirds of eligible debt and an extended
repayment period.
The US has been the only member of the Group of Seven leading economic
nations to withhold its support for the Trinidad terms. However, the new
administration is seeking congressional approval for legislative and
budgetary measures to allow the US to implement debt or debt service
reduction.
The Trinidad terms are intended to help some 19 countries, mainly in
sub-Saharan Africa. Mr Nelson points out in a speech he is due to deliver
today that the total outstanding long-term debt stock of severely indebted
low income countries is over Dollars 150bn (Pounds 9.9bn).
Reduction of debt would help to ensure creditor nations get some return on
the remaining stock of debt outstanding, said Mr Nelson.
Concern about the plight of the poorest countries was also highlighted
yesterday by Actionaid, the UK charity. It released a report showing badly
targeted aid and cuts in public spending mean help is not reaching these
countries. With 13 out of 20 donor countries set to cut or freeze official
aid to the Third World, the report suggests that rich countries could double
the impact of help by targeting donations at those who need it most. Such a
move would not compromise public spending targets, it said.
Mr Martin Griffiths, Actionaid director, said estimates indicated only
around 10 per cent of the Pounds 32bn given by the biggest donor governments
was targeted directly at poverty alleviation.
