FT  08 JUN 93 / Ulster wins car radio plant
CARMEN Electronics, the South Korean car radio manufacturer, is to create
257 jobs at a new factory in Northern Ireland.
The company said yesterday that it was investing Pounds 9.5m at a site being
developed by the Industrial Development Board at Dungannon, Co Tyrone, an
unemployment blackspot.
Carmen, whose equipment is sold in the UK under the Goodmans name, will be
making car stereos at the plant and expects to complete its local
recruitment by 1996.
The IDB said it had secured the project in the face of stiff competition
from several other European countries.
Mr Robert Atkins, Ulster's economy minister, said the investment would
create significant employment and skills opportunities in the area. He said
Carmen had been attracted to Dungannon partly because of the successful
power-sharing arrangement on the local authority.
Unionist and Nationalist councillors introduced a power-sharing arrangement
several years ago whereby the mayor's post is rotated every six months.
Mr KH Choy, Carmen's president, said the company had decided to locate to
Northern Ireland because the province provided a cost-effective base to
expand into the European Community and develop sales in eastern Europe. 'We
selected Northern Ireland as our European manufacturing centre because it
provides an ideal springboard from which to expand our already substantial
field base throughout the EC,' he said.
