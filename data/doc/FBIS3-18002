  [Text] Tallinn, Mar 30, BNS -- The Estonian Customs 
Department foresees no difficulties in coping with the Baltic 
free-trade agreement that comes into force April 1, Jaanus Raud, 
head of the Customs Department foreign relations division, said 
at a press conference at the Foreign Ministry today. 
  Since Estonia has no customs restrictions, the goods coming 
from Latvia and Lithuania will not add to the workload of 
customs officers, Raud claimed. Free-trade agreements with 
members of the European Free Trade Agreement have allowed the 
Customs Department to gain enough experience in issuing 
certificates of origin, so the addition of Latvia and Lithuania 
will pose no problems, he added. 
  Latvians and Lithuanians, on the other hand, may run into 
difficulties, since they have established a domestic market 
protection system and now face the task of checking 
certificates, Foreign Ministry Deputy Chancellor Priit Kolbre 
claimed. 
  Signe Ratso, an official from the Economics Ministry 
international relations department, added that many Estonian 
enterprises are impatiently waiting for the free-trade agreement 
to take effect to begin export of their output into the 
neighboring countries.
