GROUP DONATES $100,000 FOR SALVATION ARMY SHELTER 
A $100,000 grant -- the largest ever given by the Glendale Community Foundation 
-- has been awarded to the Salvation Army toward purchase of the first shelter 
for homeless families in Glendale. 
The 34-year-old nonprofit group last week allocated the grant toward purchase 
of the Booth House, a private residence at 609 Chester St. that the Salvation 
Army plans to convert into a temporary shelter for displaced families. 
The Glendale City Council last month allocated $200,000 in federal grant money 
for the Booth House. The Salvation Army will use the foundation grant in paying 
the balance of the $460,000 purchase price at the close of escrow June 26. The 
shelter is expected to open in September. 
Tom Miller, executive director of the community group, said the foundation 
typically awards grants of $500 to $10,000 to individual charities and 
organizations. He said the unusually large grant was made at the request of a 
member who asked that a portion of his own funds be allocated to the shelter. 
Miller said the donor, who asked to remain anonymous, is a longtime trustee of 
the foundation and also a member of the Salvation Army's Advisory Board who 
supports efforts to assist the community's homeless. 
Foundation members can contribute to both unrestricted funds and "donor-advised 
funds" in which the donor recommends where his or her contributions should be 
spent. The final award is made by an executive board. 
The foundation last week also allocated $5,000 in unrestricted funds to assist 
in refurbishing the outdoor recreational area at the Salvation Army Day Care 
Center, $1,496 for desks and chairs for the new Glendale Family Services 
facility at 410 W. Arden St., $2,100 for a computer to replace typewriters at 
the Atwater Park Center and $2,500 for computer equipment for Goodwill 
Industries.
