FT  15 AUG 92 / Haiti returnees held
Haitian police yesterday detained more than 150 boat people minutes after
the US Coast Guard forcibly returned them to their homeland, AP reports from
Port-au-Prince. A police officer said they would be questioned about the
hijacking of the 40-ft vessel in which they made their escape.
