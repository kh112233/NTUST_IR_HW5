FT  11 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Kiwi fruit cartel probe in Japan
JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission is investigating a New Zealand based company
and nine local trading houses charged with forming an illegal cartel in kiwi
fruit, an FTC official said. Reuter reports from Tokyo.
New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board (Japan), sole importer of the fruit,
said it was questioned by the FTC over the allegation on September 3, but
the company denied it was involved in price fixing.
The official said the FTC had started questioning the trading companies,
including Mitsubishi and C. Itoh.
The New Zealand Kiwifruit company said: 'We are willing to co-operate with
the FTC on the investigation and watch the developments.'
Agriculture ministry data show that domestic production of kiwi fruit in
1991-92, ending March, was 45,700 tonnes, while imports were 42,700 tonnes.
About 99 per cent of imports come from New Zealand. The ministry said its
data showed Japan was the world's biggest kiwi fruit importer.
