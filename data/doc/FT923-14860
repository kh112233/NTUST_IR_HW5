FT  04 JUL 92 / Slovaks block Havel bid for re-election
CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S President Vaclav Havel failed yesterday to win re-election
to the federal presidency, as Slovak parliamentarians blocked his candidacy
in the federal assembly.
The popular playwright-turned-president was eclipsed by a handful of Slovak
members of parliament who failed to give him a majority in the Slovak side
of the federal assembly.
The constitution states a presidential candidate must receive a majority of
votes in both the lower chamber of the federal assembly and in the upper
chamber, where Czech and Slovak parliamentarians vote separately and have
equal weight.
This gave a virtual veto to the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS),
the nationalist group led by Mr Vladimir Meciar, who had pledged to block Mr
Havel's re-election.
Mr Havel will stay in office until October 5 unless another presidential
candidate is elected by then. A second round of voting is planned for July
16 and potential alternative candidates have until then to come forward. In
theory, Mr Havel could run again in subsequent rounds if no other candidate
has yet been elected.
Members of the Civic Democratic party (ODS), the Czech party led by Mr
Vaclav Klaus, the Czech premier, will equally be able to block another
candidate, however. Mr Klaus has said he will not support another candidate
for the federal presidency.
Failure to elect a president will plunge Czechoslovakia deeper into a crisis
which threatens to pull the Czech and Slovak republics apart. A recent
agreement between ODS and HZDS, gives the Czech and Slovak parliaments until
September 30 to decide on the federation's future.
