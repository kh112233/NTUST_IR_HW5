FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Florida fears
There was a Florida theme attached to the fortunes of a number of stocks
yesterday following the previous day's fallout from the murder of a British
tourist in the US state.
Rank Organisation chose yesterday to announce a multi-billion dollar
extension to its jointly owned Florida theme park. As well as worries that
the state's tourism would be badly hit in the long as well as the short term
by Tuesday's events, there were also rumblings of the need for a bumper
rights issue to fund the venture. Rank slid 21 to 773p in heavy trade of
1.9m.
Another casualty was Bass, which owns the Holiday Inn chain. Analysts said
the company received sizeable income from its hotels in the Florida region.
The stock was also hurt by Allied-Lyons' caution on the pace of US economic
recovery - as was Grand Metropolitan, off 13 at 418p. Bass finished 13 down
at 479p. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, on the other hand, firmed 3 to 483p on the
perceived benefits to its Centre Parcs holiday centres from a decline in
visitors to Florida. Hoare Govett was said to be positive on the stock.
