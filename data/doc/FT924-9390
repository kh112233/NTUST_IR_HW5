FT  06 NOV 92 / Caribbean in nuclear protest
SEVERAL Caribbean governments are seeking to stop a shipment of plutonium
through the region, despite Japanese assurances that the load is not
dangerous.
The members of the Caribbean Community say they will try to get the support
of the United Nations for a ban on shipments of plutonium and other
radioactive materials through the Caribbean Sea.
The governments claim the planned shipment, from Cherbourg in France on the
3,800-tonne Japanese vessel the 'Akatsuki Maru,' is the first of several to
Japan over the next eight years. It will pass through the Caribbean 'in a
few weeks,' according to environmentalists, followed by 38 more shipments
from Europe to Japan, where the plutonium is to be used in fast breeder
nuclear reactors.
The Japanese government has said that the ship carrying the plutonium will
'meet or exceed' all international standards for safety, and the shipment
will not threaten the marine environment.
The decision not to announce the planned route of the ship was to avoid a
possible hijacking by terrorists, Tokyo said. There was no indication of
when the ship would pass through the region, as the statement said only that
it will be 'in autumn of this year,' and that it will be escorted by an
armed vessel 'capable of continuously monitoring the neighbouring sea area'.
Governments in the region appear not to have been mollified, and say they
intend to ask the UN to have the Caribbean declared a nuclear-free zone for
the purposes of shipment, storing or dumping of material.
The ship has already been banned from the territorial waters of several
countries, and the cargo has raised concerns of governments of some states
along likely alternate routes.
