FT  16 SEP 93 / Bonn seeks new Nazi ban
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet yesterday decided to ask Germany's
constitutional court to ban the Free German Workers' Party (FAP), one of the
country's leading neo-Nazi groups, Reuter reports from Bonn.
The interior minister, Mr Manfred Kanther, said the decision showed the
government was determined to fight far-right extremists who threatened
democracy and disturbed the peace for both Germans and foreign residents.
