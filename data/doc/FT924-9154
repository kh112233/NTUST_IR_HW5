FT  07 NOV 92 / Amnesty seeks investigation into Angolan rights abuses
AMNESTY International, the human rights body, yesterday expressed concern
about reports of killings of Unita officials and supporters by
government-armed civilians.
Amnesty said it was calling on the government to establish an impartial and
independent investigation of the allegations of gross human rights abuses.
The call came amid continued efforts by South Africa, the US and the United
Nations to bring Unita, the former rebel movement, and the government
together for peace talks after fierce street fighting in Luanda and several
other provincial cities in the past seven days.
Those efforts are being hampered by the fact that many of the most senior
and western-educated leaders of Unita, who have been responsible for
negotiating with the government during the past 17 months, have been killed
or are missing.
Unita yesterday appealed to the US to intervene to stop fighting in the
war-ravaged country, which it claimed had left 15,000 people dead.
Unita officials said the government launched a 'brutal pogrom' intended to
wipe Unita out of the cities.
Listed among the Unita fatalities are Vice-President Jeremias Chitunda and
Mr Elias Salupeto Pena, Unita's representative to the joint body overseeing
the peace process. A Portuguese correspondent in Luanda who saw the corpses
of both men said they had received bullet wounds to their heads fired from
point blank range.
Diplomats in Luanda said earlier this week that during the fighting armed
civilians went on house-to-house manhunts for Unita supporters and that the
streets of the capital were littered with corpses.
