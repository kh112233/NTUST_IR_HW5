Wildlife officials in Alaska are confronting new problems related to the Exxon 
Valdez oil spill in March. Recently, it has been discovered that some bald 
eagles have abandoned their nests, sometimes with oil-blotched eggs containing 
dead embryos, said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials. Theories on why 
the birds are deserting their nests include the possibility that eagles 
scavenging on fouled shorelines may be getting their feathers soiled and 
spreading oil to their eggs, where it penetrates porous shells and kills unborn 
chicks. Or eagles may be frightened by cleanup crews working near their nests, 
experts said. Meanwhile, mother seals and pups are being coated with oil at 
rookeries. Even so, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Coast Guard 
warned against capturing seal pups because they are better off with their 
mothers in the wild.
