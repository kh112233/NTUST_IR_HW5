  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 05, BNS -- The Bank of Estonia predicts 
that earnings into the state budget for the first half of this 
year may well exceed the original estimates by as much as 
160-180 million kroons. 
  The more-than-predicted income may even exceed 200 million 
kroons if earnings from the corporate income tax and profits 
from state-owned companies reach the original estimates, the 
macroeconomics department at the Estonian central bank says. 
  The central bank says, however, that the total balance 
depends on the discipline of taxpayers and on the work of the 
tax department. 
  The report says a higher than predicted earnings level in 
all 
sections of the state budget will become a reality only if 
taxpayers attach equal importance to all their obligations. It 
cannot be ruled out that money will be lacking in some regions 
because of big regional differences in the payroll fund. 
  The higher than expected budgetary income is expected to 
have 
a big positive effect so that Estonia could be able to start 
paying higher pensions without the introduction of additional 
taxes. 
  The government departments directly involved in distributing 
budget funds have called increasing the pensions at the current 
tax burden level a too risky step.
