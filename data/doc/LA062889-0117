NEWSWIRE: TWO REPORTS SAY USE OF STEROIDS WIDESPREAD IN EAST GERMANY 
Two former athletes, one a world champion ski jumper, have charged that East 
Germany customarily gives young athletes steroids, two newspapers reported in 
Hamburg, West Germany. 
The reports said that all top East German sports stars are required to use the 
drugs and that such successful athletes as figure skater Katerina Witt, 
sprinter Renate Stecher and swimmer Kristin Otto are among those who have 
regularly used anabolic steroids. 
"Every athlete who competes internationally for East Germany is doped, every 
one," said Hans-Juergen Noczenski, former head of the East German Judo Assn. 
Noczenski fled East Germany last February and now lives in Austria. 
Hans-Georg Aschenbach, the former East German ski jumping star, was quoted as 
saying that he was told to take steroids during his athletic career and that it 
is required among all top East German athletes. 
"I swallowed and injected anabolics for eight years," Aschenbach, 38, was 
quoted as saying. "We had to take this medicine. We were required to. Whoever 
didn't was forced out of the national squad and faced great difficulties in 
private life." 
Aschenbach fled East Germany last year and now works as a doctor specializing 
in athlete treatment in the West German city of Freiburg. 
East German sports officials, Aschenbach said, give steroid pills to promising 
athletes as young as 13 without telling them what the pills contain. 
"That's one reason I fled," he was quoted as saying.
