  [Text] Superstition has been identified as the major 
contributory factory to the prevalence of yaws in the Birim 
North District of the Eastern Region. 
  A source close to the New Abirem Health Centre told the 
GRAPHIC that even though c300 is charged for the full treatment 
of the disease, the number of people treated is negligible. 
  As a result, only 460 out of 5,871 cases of yaws detected in 
a recent survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in the 
district have been treated. 
  The source said the superstitious belief of parents that 
injections would paralyse their children and poverty are the 
main causes for the low figure. 
  The district which is among one of the least developed areas 
in the country has the highest number of yaws cases in the 
Eastern Region. 
  It mentioned Mamago, Adauseua, Hhweakwae, Zongo as 
communities where the disease is spreading. 
  The disease is caused by a spirochaete and can be fatal if 
left untreated.
