IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE; 
U. OF UTAH PRESIDENT TO RETIRE 
University of Utah President Chase N. Peterson is retiring at the end of the 
next academic year, largely because of his role in the cold fusion controversy. 
Researchers at the university announced last year that they had developed a 
simple, table-top apparatus that produced more energy than it consumed, 
presumably through a fusion reaction similar to that which fuels the sun. 
Peterson has been a vocal proponent of the concept. 
Last month, controversy erupted when it became known that a $500,000 donation 
to the school's fusion research center that had been characterized by the 
university as an "anonymous" outside gift actually was the result of a 
Peterson-authorized transfer of money from the school's Research Foundation. 
Peterson on June 1 said that hiding the origin of the donation was a mistake. 
He said he had hoped to avoid jealousy within other departments, but had "hurt 
the credibility of the institute." 
Peterson was also criticized for his role in a another funding imbroglio. In 
June, Salt Lake medical equipment manufacturer James L. Sorenson donated $15 
million in pharmaceutical stock to the university with the understanding that 
the medical school and hospital would be renamed in his honor. Peterson was 
forced to return the donation after protests from doctors, faculty and 
students.
