FT  09 MAY 94 / Mandela's calls for reconciliation between races
South Africa's President-designate Nelson Mandela, whose African National
Congress will be formally installed as majority party at the opening of the
new national assembly this morning, stressed over the weekend what is likely
to become the dominant theme of his presidency, calling for reconciliation
between races.
Outgoing President FW de Klerk continued to juggle with his selection of
candidates for the six cabinet posts allocated his defeated National party,
at the same time pursuing efforts to secure one of the security portfolios,
both of which have been claimed by the ANC.
Speaking to a cheering crowd at a Christian thanksgiving service led by
Archbishop Desmond Tutu at a stadium outside Johannesburg yesterday, Mr
Mandela stressed the need for everyone to carry through the peaceful spirit
of the election period.
