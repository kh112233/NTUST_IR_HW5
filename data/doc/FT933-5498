FT  03 SEP 93 / Much talk, little action on help for war victims
THIS week's conference on the protection of war victims called by the
International Committee of the Red Cross demonstrated the gap between good
intentions and political realities.
The 160 or so countries taking part declared they would take stronger action
to enforce rules protecting civilians in wartime. But there must remain
doubts as to how the declaration will be translated into practice.
Before the conference Mr Cornelio Sommaruga, the ICRC president, urged the
US, Britain and France to ratify the 1977 protocols which outlaw methods of
warfare that cause unnecessary suffering and to extend the rules on
protection of non-combatants to civil conflicts. None of the three said it
would.
Similarly, there is a general recognition that better ways have to be found
to make humanitarian law effective in civil conflicts, where the fighting
may be done not by disciplined troops but by armed bands, and where
civilians are all too often deliberate targets rather than accidental
victims.
The general rules laid down in the Geneva Conventions and the later
protocols apply to internal wars but getting them to stick is another
matter.
The conference agreed to ask the Swiss government to convene a group of
experts to study 'practical means' of promoting full compliance with
international humanitarian law, but this is unlikely to produce results for
a year or so.
The declaration contained a specific call to outlaw anti-personnel mines,
some 85m of which remain uncleared around the world, inflicting a daily toll
of innocent victims.
