FT  19 APR 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Got nitrogen in the can
THE RACE by brewers to provide traditional beers in the latest thin-walled
drink cans could be speeded up by a development from BOC.
The Guildford company has filed a patent for a way of dissolving nitrogen
gas in the beer before it is canned. Tests on nitrogen show that it does not
alter the characteristics of the beer at all.
After packaging the nitrogen is released from the liquid and exerts pressure
on the aluminium or steel can walls, making them rigid. They can then be
stacked on supermarket shelves or pallets without damage.
BOC believes the technique is easier to control and monitor than existing
methods of canning beer, where liquid nitrogen is fed into the can just
before closure. BOC's Stackmaster process could also be used for soft
drinks, and for bottling in plastic (Pet - polyester terephthalate)
containers as well.
