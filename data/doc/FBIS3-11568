  [Excerpts] At 0617 today, 21 March, there was a railway 
accident in the place known as Cumbre, located in Placetas 
Municipality, Villa Clara Province. A train made up of 23 tanker 
cars full of oil coming from Cienfuegos Province crashed into 
another freight train, which was parked and waiting for the 
go-ahead. The crash resulted in serious injuries to two crew 
members. [passage omitted] 
  Of the train's 23 tank cars, only two suffered damage, and 
thanks to quick action taken, it was possible to save a great 
part of the fuel they were carrying. 
  Captain Ardelio Garcia, deputy provincial criminal 
investigations chief in Villa Clara Province, comments on the 
causes of the accident: 
  [Begin Garcia recording] It is nothing more than a violation 
of the railway's operating regulations. The human factor. We 
have seen that there was an obvious violation of the right of 
way. [end recording] 
  Just hours after the accident, the track had been put back 
in 
working order, and the material damages were being assessed.
