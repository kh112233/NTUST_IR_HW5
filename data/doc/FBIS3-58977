<H5>  Developments in Russia Are Cause for Concern </H5>
  [Acikel] The leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who made a very strong showing in the 
Russian elections, is constantly making statements against 
Turkey. How do you assess this? 
  [Ciller] Winds of nationalism are sweeping across our 
northern neighbor Russia. But it would be incorrect to say that 
President Yeltsin is also thinking along these lines. 
Nevertheless, Zhirinovskiy's election victory shows that this 
sentiment exists among the people. Therefore, we must be 
careful. I am not saying that this is a threat to us, but it 
poses a risk. We told the entire world that it stands to lose 
if it shapes its policy based on Yeltsin alone. There are 
serious developments there that are cause for concern. Turkey 
cannot act with laxity. 
<H5>  Warning to Papandreou </H5>
  [Acikel] Prime Minister Papandreou is moving fast on the 
Greek front. He sent military advisers and hardware to the 
Greek Cypriot sector, and started oil prospecting in the Aegean 
Sea. What will the future ties between Turkey and Greece be? 
  [Ciller] Papandreou is doing wrong. To enter into an armed 
clash jointly with the Greek Cypriots, or engage in oil 
prospecting to the dismay of Turkey would bring no gains to 
Greece. These are not sound things to do. Whenever Papandreou 
comes to power he resorts to activities disagreeable to Turkey. 
We will act according to developments. We will respond to 
friendship with friendship and understanding, and will give the 
necessary reply to wickedness. I am not saying this just for 
something to say. We are powerful. We have never given, and 
will not give, any concession of our power. 
<H5>  They Will Be the Losers </H5>
  [Acikel] Judging from your statements, it appears that 
feelings of enmity at Turkey's periphery have become pronounced. 
What are you going to say to these negative stances by Russia 
and Greece? 
  [Ciller] Disappointment awaits those countries that are not 
friendly to us. They will not get what they are after and will 
suffer enormous losses. I am stating this openly. I am saying 
this with a pride derived from being an Islamic country and a 
Muslim. They might threaten us and shout war cries, but they 
cannot give the slightest trouble to us. They will be the 
losers. I am not engaged in empty talk, and I am not issuing 
threats. We are an extremely powerful country. We are a very 
dynamic country in international forums. Threats are not the 
object of our power. No one should fear Turkey. I repeat, we 
will do what is required in case of any development to the 
detriment of Turkey's interests. Let them not harbor enmity, 
they will be sorry for it. 
  [Acikel] Britain and France are working to establish an 
independent Kurdish state within Iraq. They want to use their 
power as big states. What will Turkey's stance be on this issue? 
  [Ciller] We are opposed to the violation of Iraq's 
territorial integrity; we will not allow it. Those are oil 
regions. Any change or wrong move will set the place ablaze. 
Iraq's territorial integrity should be preserved not only for 
Turkey's interest but also for international stability. The 
creation of a Kurdish state will push that region into a 
historic mistake. World peace might be disrupted. Turkey is 
opposed to the creation of an independent Kurdish state; we will 
never allow it. 
  [Acikel] Why were discharges from army service postponed for 
three months? Do you not think that those who completed their 
service to the country were adversely affected by this decision? 
  [Ciller] As you can see, there are problems all around 
Turkey, undesirable developments are taking place. We extended 
the discharge periods to forestall painful developments. The 
situation in the north, west, and south is obvious to you. We 
could not have moved troops from our borders with Greece to the 
southeast, and from the southeast to our northern borders. We 
are thinking of Turkey's interests, and are protecting our 
people and country. We could not have pretended not to see 
these developments just because we are peace-loving and friendly 
country. To reduce the number of troops in these regions 
through discharges would have been a blow to our deterrent 
power. Neighboring countries might have taken advantage of it.
