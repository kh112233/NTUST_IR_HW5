  [Text] Cairo, Feb 10 (AFP) -- The main Moslem militant 
group on Thursday [10 February] claimed responsibility for the 
murder of a policeman in southern Egypt and warned bank 
depositors that time was running out for them to withdraw their 
funds. 
  The group said in a statement sent to AFP that Wednesday's 
shooting of a policeman was the fourth operation out of seven to 
avenge the killing of seven of its members last week by police. 
  Three other people were wounded when the policeman was shot 
outside a mosque in Aswan, 900 kilometers (540 miles) south of 
Cairo. 
  Some 300 people have died since the militants began their 
campaign two years ago, and the money-spinning tourist industry 
has been brought to its knees. 
  The al-Jama'ah on Tuesday gave bank clients two weeks to 
withdraw their money, warning that its campaign against "usury" 
will become "more violent and ferocious." Islam prohibits the 
charging of interest on loans. 
  It added Thursday that bank clients should "withdraw rapidly 
their funds before losing them." 
  The militants seek to bring down the government of President 
Husni Mubarak and install an Iranian-style Islamic republic.
