  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 2 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- [passage 
omitted] The hope for peace in Guatemala seems to fade with the 
murder of Chief Justice Eduardo Epaminondas Gonzalez, president 
of the country's highest constitutional authority, during the 
predawn hours of Holy Saturday. Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge 
Mario Garcia Laguardia said the murder is a "national absurdity" 
perpetrated by "savages" who have dealt a heavy blow against the 
Constitutionality Court. He expressed regret such actions could 
occur when there "seemed" to be hope for peace in the country, 
following the signing of the human rights agreements between the 
government and the guerrillas. He demanded the authorities find 
and punish the guilty. 
  Holy Week ceremonies have also seen attacks against a cousin 
of former President Jorge Serrano Elias and journalist Marco 
Tulio Roca, the murder of a street child, and the lynching of a 
U.S. tourist. The Catholic Church has asked Guatemalans not to 
"falter" in this wave of violence and impunity, and has asked 
the government to seriously face the task of attaining peace.
