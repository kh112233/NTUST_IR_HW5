  [Text] The security services informed us about two hours 
ago that after thorough investigations in the Casbah district 
the security forces have been able to eliminate the gang that 
assassinated our colleague the journalist Hassan Benaouda on 5 
March. The security forces stormed a house in the Casbah 
district that was used as a hideout. They were able to 
eliminate two members of the gang -- Keriati Salah, 24 years 
old, the ringleader of the crime, and Dakadjar Mohamed, 26 years 
old. Three members of the gang were arrested -- Cherchali 
Samir, 23 years old; Bouhedda Hocine, 19 years old; and Lehdjal 
Djamel, 23 years old. 
  Also Today EL WATAN, quoting security sources, said that 
those supposedly involved in the assassination of our journalist 
colleague Abdelkader Hireche had been eliminated after the 
security forces clashed with the armed gang consisting of six 
people in the Rue de Constantine where they lived. Three of 
them were killed, the other three were wounded, and the weapons 
in their possession were recovered. The three who were killed 
were Chelila Laid, unemployed; Seblal Mohamed, unemployed; and 
Benkhoutir Nabil who lived in Tarablus Street in Hocine Dey. 
  The security services also said that during this week their 
forces had been able to eliminate 57 terrorists in Blida, 
Algiers, Batna, and Bouira Provinces. A large quantity of 
weapons that had been in their possession was recovered. 
Numerous terrorist elements, many of whom had been identified 
and were wanted by the security and justice services, were 
arrested.
