  [Text] Colonel Alberto Antonio, spokesman for the Southern 
Front Military Command, says that the Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, 
continue to drive back attacks by the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces and will continue to 
respond firmly to provocative operations by that movement. He 
described the situation on the Southern Front as tense. Between 
5 and 31 March, the UNITA troops carried out 15 attacks on 
government positions, which were also shelled on 10 occasions. 
Col. Alberto Antonio also said that the rebels carried out 
numerous ambushes on civilian and military vehicles, abducted 
people, stole cattle, mined areas, and moved men and military 
equipment. 
  [Begin Antonio recording] In response to those provocative 
and criminal operations by the enemy forces, the FAA troops have 
inflicted severe losses on them, including: 69 soldiers killed 
and 55 AKM weapons, 31 clips, nine 60mm mortars, 10 RPG-7 rocket 
launchers, six (?mortars), 10 shells of various calibers, and 
assorted ammunition captured. Our forces are also holding one 
UNITA soldier who surrendered and two who were captured. 
  We regret having to report that six FAA soldiers were killed 
and another 16 wounded. We also regret the fact that 13 
civilians were killed and another 11 wounded. [end recording]
