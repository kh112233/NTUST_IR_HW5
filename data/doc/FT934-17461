FT  01 OCT 93 / Bonn split on crime plan
A PROGRAMME to fight rising crime, announced yesterday by Germany's interior
minister, Mr Manfred Kanther, has sparked virulent protests from the liberal
Free Democrats, adding to strains on the coalition government.
The programme, which Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his allies hope to put to
parliament in the autumn, aims to strengthen police forces and improve
co-ordination between them and security agencies.
Crime, from small burglaries to operations by organised gangs and growing
numbers of racist attacks, is expected to be a big issue in next year's
elections.
The measures, however, include permission to place listening devices in the
homes of suspects and allowing policemen, acting as undercover agents, to be
involved in criminal actions, steps which threaten to further divide the
Bonn coalition, already weakened by disputes over the choice of a
presidential candidate and a healthcare plan for the elderly.
The Free Democrats (FDP), junior partners in the coalition, are struggling
to sharpen their party's profile, and hope their opposition to the measures
will tap into the historical suspicions of many Germans about strengthening
the security forces and about state surveillance of individuals.
'We are convinced that some essential legal principles should not be given
up,' Mr Burkhard Hirsch, FDP deputy responsible for domestic security, said
yesterday. 'It is a populist simplification to fight crime by passing more
laws and closing your eyes to the causes behind it.'
The FDP also opposes plans for tougher penal sanctions against criminals
under 21 in order to deter delinquents from crime and clamp down on racial
violence. It argues that racial violence can only be tackled by changing the
status of foreigners in Germany and devising an immigration policy - an
issue on which conservative members of the government refuse to move.
