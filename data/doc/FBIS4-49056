  [Text] Johannesburg, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Nelson Mandela, 
president of the African National Congress, declared here 
tonight his party the victor in South Africa's first all-race 
elections. 
  Speaking at a victory celebration here, Mandela said: "I 
regard it as the highest honor to lead the ANC at this moment in 
our history, and that we have been chosen to lead our country 
into the new century." 
  Mandela said: "Although not yet final we have received the 
provisional results of the election and are delighted by the 
overwhelming support for the African National Congress." 
  The ANC leader reiterated that the victory for the ANC is a 
victory for the people. 
  "To the people of South Africa and the world who are 
watching... This is a joyous night for the human spirit. This 
is your victory too. You helped end apartheid. You stood with 
us through the transition," he said. 
  "This is one of the most important moments in the life of 
our 
country. I stand before you filled with deep pride and joy -- 
pride in the ordinary, humble people of this country," he said.
