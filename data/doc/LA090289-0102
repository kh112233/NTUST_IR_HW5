A government report said that anabolic steroids should be designated a 
federally controlled substance after a study found that steroids lead to 
increased risk of heart disease. 
The report by the General Accounting Office was based on 15 studies of steroid 
use in the United States. One study found that 6.6% of male high school seniors 
have used steroids, and a different study found that between 15% and 20% of 
college athletes have used steroids.
