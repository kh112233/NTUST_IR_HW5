PAIN PILLS TO BEAR WARNING OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS 
The government Wednesday directed makers of prescription pain pills to add new 
warnings informing doctors that such drugs may increase the risk of 
life-threatening gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers. 
The Food and Drug Administration announced that it had ordered manufacturers to 
add a warning citing studies that show that up to 4% of people who receive 
continued therapy with pain-relieving drugs may develop serious 
gastrointestinal reactions. 
The side effects, which include peptic ulcers and intestinal perforation, 
sometimes occur in people without any warning symptoms, the FDA noted. 
The prescription drugs in question are called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs, or NSAIDs. They generally are considered safer than steroid treatments, 
which they have largely replaced, and often are essential in treating serious 
arthritis. Some are approved for pain and menstrual cramps also. 
FDA data shows that the drugs are being prescribed for conditions, such as 
tendinitis, sprains or joint and muscle pain, that can be treated with other 
therapies bearing fewer side effects, according to the new labeling. 
FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young urged doctors "to discuss with their patients 
the risks and benefits of using these drugs." 
The drugs for which the new labels are required include: Voltaren, Nalfon, 
Tolectin, Indocin, Dolobid, Meclomen, Feldene, Ponstel, Anaprox, Naprosyn, 
Orudis, Butazolidin, Rufen, Motrin, Ansaid and generic versions of ibuprofen, 
indomethacin and phenylbutazone.
