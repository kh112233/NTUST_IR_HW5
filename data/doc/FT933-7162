FT  24 AUG 93 / Fishermen agree end to Valdez blockade
ALASKA'S Valdez oil terminal opened again yesterday after fishermen agreed
to end a blockade provoked by their complaints that the effects of the 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill had devastated their salmon catch.
Mr Bruce Babbitt, US interior secretary, intervened in the dispute on
Sunday, harshly criticising Exxon, the oil giant, for refusing to meet the
fishermen.
He also persuaded the protesters to move their fishing vessels from the
Valdez narrows, where they had prevented at least seven oil tankers from
docking to take on Alaskan crude oil.
The Alyeska pipeline which ends at Valdez handles about a quarter of US
crude oil production.
Mr Babbitt also promised action at a meeting in Anchorage yesterday to clean
up the operation of the Dollars 900m (Pounds 604m) trust fund set up with
Exxon money after the Exxon Valdez disaster.
The fund, administered by federal and Alaskan officials, has been criticised
in a new report from Congress's General Accounting Office, which found that
most of the Dollars 200m it had spent so far had gone to reimburse state and
federal agencies, and Exxon itself, for past clean-up work, and for
administrative and legal expenses.
The GAO said the trust fund had approved projects which 'either do not
appear to be directly linked to the oil spill or appear to duplicate
existing responsibilities of federal and state agencies'.
Congressman George Miller, who commissioned the report, added that 'the
bureaucrats gave top priority to feather-ing their own nests with
reimbursements and gold-plated studies of questionable merit.'
Mr Babbitt promised he would urge the fund's trustees at yesterday's meeting
to devote more money to buying land to protect the rivers where salmon
spawn.
Exxon said no scientific link had been established between this year's low
pink salmon catch and the 11m gallons of oil its tanker spilled into Alaska
waters when it ran aground in 1989.
