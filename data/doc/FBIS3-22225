  [Text] Riga, Feb 21, LETA -- The Estonian delegation from 
the Ministry of the Environment Protection last week paid a 
two-day visit to Latvia in order to work out the treaty on 
cooperation with the similar institution in Latvia and sign it. 
  According to the approved document, in future, the two 
ministries will jointly solve the problems of the improving of 
the waters in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga, coordinate 
economic activities in the pre-frontier land regions, take care 
of the maintenance of the sound environment in the places of 
migration of birds and in nature reserves. An agreement relating 
to the common positions in strengthening of the control over 
possible transit transportation of dangerous waste via Latvia 
and Estonia was also reached. The two states will regularly 
exchange business information with each other. 
  As soon as a corresponding ministry will be laid in the 
Republic of Lithuania, a trilateral treaty will be signed. Then, 
the joint programme of cooperation among the Baltic States in 
the sphere of the environment protection will be worked out.
