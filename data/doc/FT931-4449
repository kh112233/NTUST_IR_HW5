FT  11 MAR 93 / Another arrest over NY explosion
A THIRD person was arrested yesterday in connection with New York's World
Trade Centre explosion, which killed at least five people and injured more
than 1,000, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The suspect, identified by Cable News Network as Mr Nidal Ayyad, is believed
to be a 25-year-old chemical engineer. He is alleged to have taken part in
renting the van believed to have been used in the bombing.
Last week, Mr Mohammed Salameh was charged with aiding and abetting the
bombing and subsequent fire and with transporting explosives across state
lines.
