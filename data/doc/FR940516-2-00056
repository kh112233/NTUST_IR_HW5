 

Supplementary Information:
Grant Amounts


Approximately $12.5 million in discretionary grants to establish CHCs in new geographic areas and/or to establish
new CHC service delivery sites for existing CHCs in new or existing geographic areas will be made available under section
330 of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 254c). Of the approximately $12.5 million available, approximately $8.5 million will
be directed to new CHCs and approximately $4 million will be directed to new CHC service delivery sites that expand
the service capacity (i.e., increase the number of new patients served) of existing CHCs.


Number of Awards


Approximately 35 to 40 section 330 awards will be made. The awards will range up to $600,000, including a limit of $150,000
for capital requests. Awards will be made for a one year budget period. Project periods for new CHCs will be for up to
two years, while expansion grants will have project periods consistent with the ongoing grant.


Eligible Applicants


Eligible applicants for new CHCs are public or private nonprofit entities. Section 329 grantees not currently receiving
section 330 funds may request section 330 funds to support primary health services for other than migrant and seasonal
farmworkers and their families. The proposed service area must be a defined geographic area or population which is
federally designated, in whole or in part, as a MUA or MUP. Applicants must be prepared to provide the comprehensive
primary health services required under section 330, and supplemental services necessary to assure that required
primary health services are provided effectively.
Eligible applicants for CHC expansions must be current recipients of section 330 funds. The applicant's proposed
delivery system, in conjunction with its current delivery capacity, must provide the comprehensive primary health
services required under section 330, and supplemental services necessary to assure that required primary health
care services are provided effectively. The proposed service area must be a defined geographic area or population
which is federally designated, in whole or in part, as a MUA or MUP.


Criteria for Evaluation


When determining whether Federal support will be made available for CHC new start or expansion grants, the Department
will review the applications for compliance with standard criteria stipulated in the program regulations (42 CFR
51c.305 for operating CHCs). These include:
(a) The relative need of the population to be served for the services to be provided based on the following indicators:

For urban applicants: (1) Percentage of the population with incomes below 200 percent of the official poverty level;
(2) percentage of minority populations; (3) percentage of the population that is uninsured; (4) a shortage of necessary
primary care health professionals to meet the needs of the target population; and (5) other documented community
health issues such as a high unemployment rate, high growth rate of minority/special populations, high percentage
of immigrant population, high infant mortality rate/high percentage of low birthweight, late entry into prenatal
care, high teenage pregnancy rate, high morbidity rates due to specific diseases, high percentage geriatric population,
cultural/language barriers, or excessive travel time/distance to next nearest source of primary care for the target
population.
For rural applicants: (1) Percentage of the population with incomes below 200 percent of the official poverty level;
(2) geographic barriers based on average travel time/distance to next nearest source of primary care that is accessible
to the target population; (3) percentage of the population that is uninsured; (4) shortage of necessary primary care
health professionals to meet the needs of the target population; and (5) other documented community health issues
such as a high unemployment rate, high growth rate of minority/special populations, high percentage of immigrant
population, high infant mortality rate/high percentage of low birthweight, late entry into prenatal care, high
teenage pregnancy rate, high morbidity rates due to specific diseases, high percentage geriatric population, cultural/language
barriers, or a high percentage of minority populations; and
(b) The extent to which the applicant's project plan for CHC new start or expansion grants meets the program requirements:
For CHC New Start and Expansions in New Service Areas: (1) The extent to which the applicant demonstrates an understanding
of its State and local health care environment (e.g., identifying key State health care initiatives/proposals and
describing local community resources/providers), and addresses how it will position itself strategically in both
of these environments;
(2) The applicant's capability in the following health services/clinical management areas: (i) A service delivery
plan that addresses the priority health problems of the target population; (ii) provision of patient case management,
the assurance of continuity of care and a quality assurance program; and (iii) an appropriate number and mix of primary
care physicians, non-physician primary care providers and clinical support staff to support the clinical component
of the service delivery plan;
(3) The degree to which the applicant ensures that its governing board is appropriately structured and has by-laws
reflecting all its functions and responsibilities. A public entity must be able to meet all governance requirements
or have an acceptable co-applicant board (governing boards of public centers by statute are not required to set general
policies for the center);
(4) The administrative and management capability of the applicant, particularly the extent to which center operations
will emphasize efficiency of operations and sound financial management;
(5) The extent to which the proposed facility is adequate and available to meet the projected demand of the target population;
and
(6) Whether the proposed new start will result in new patients being served or, for expansion applicants, whether
the proposed expansion will result in new patients being served through a new service delivery site.
For CHC Expansions in an Existing Service Area: Applicants will be evaluated according to the following criteria:
(1) The extent to which the grantee justifies a patient demand in excess of what is reasonable for the current organization
to serve;
