FT  25 FEB 94 / Buds of May rail link plan opposed
A proposal to route the fast rail link to the Channel tunnel through
unspoiled countryside west of Ashford in Kent yesterday prompted the threat
of legal action from angry local residents.
The Mayday action group said it would be the first legal challenge to the
rail route.
The line at Ashford is one of two short sections of the rail link that were
not finally decided by Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, when he
announced the route last month. Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary
that is drawing up plans for the link, announced three possible routes late
on Wednesday.
The most southerly of the suggested routes would cut through countryside
which featured in The Darling Buds of May television series, adapted from
the HE Bates novel.
The government's preferred route would take the link to the north of the
town. Ashford council is in favour of one of two routes that would take the
link through a new international station being built in the centre of town.
A middle route, which was originally rejected because it involved a Pounds
60m tunnel, has become a more likely choice because the Ministry of Defence
has freed land to allow it to run at ground level with only a short tunnel.
Union Railways plans to unveil its options for the second undecided section,
at Pepper Hill near Gravesend, on March 10.
Planning directions that safeguard the route of the Channel rail link and
trigger the procedure for blighted homes to be bought by British Rail come
into effect today.
This means that anyone seeking planning permission to carry out work on the
safeguarded route must obtain the approval of Union Railways.
