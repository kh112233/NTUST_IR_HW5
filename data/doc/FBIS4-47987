  [Text] Johannesburg May 9 SAPA -- British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd says there has been a huge upsurge in British 
business interest in South Africa. Speaking on his arrival at 
Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport on Monday [9 May] morning, Mr 
Hurd said he was in the country to show Britain's support for a 
new South Africa, which will be launched symbolically on Tuesday 
with the presidential inauguration of Nelson Mandela. He told 
reporters he would visit British-aided projects in the East Rand 
townships on Monday. Future British Government support would 
continue to focus on South Africa's needs, he said. 
  Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, who also arrived 
for 
Mr Mandela's inauguration, said South Africa had shown it was 
possible to satisfy diverse interests in a positive way. "We 
are a country that has emerged from war. The message (from 
South Africa) is political solutions have to be sought by 
peaceful means," he said. 
  Former British Prime Minister Lord James Callaghan said 
South 
Africa would be an example to the rest of Africa. Asked if he 
had a message for South Africa, Lord Callaghan said "South 
Africa is going to work out its own destiny". 
  Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was one of the most 
outspoken of the VIPs who streamed in to the airport at a steady 
rate on Monday. Of the inauguration she said: "This is a 
wonderful moment, not just for South Africa but for the world." 
  Ninety-one delegations from around the world were due to 
arrive on Monday. Representatives from Italy, Portugal, Malta, 
Spain and Finland had arrived already and included Spain's heir 
to the throne, Portuguese President Mario Soares and Finland's 
President Martii Ahtisaari. Delegations from the Bahamas, 
Trinidad and Tobago had also arrived.
