THE SIDELINES; 
BEN JOHNSON READY TO TELL HIS SIDE 
After more than eight months of waiting silently in the wings, Ben Johnson is 
ready to tell the story of how the world's fastest man fell from grace. The 
disgraced Canadian Olympic sprinter will begin testifying on Monday before a 
government inquiry into the use of drugs in sports. 
A nation that felt pride in his victories at the 1988 Seoul Olympics and then 
shame at his alleged use of banned steroids is expected to hang on his every 
word. 
The riveting issue is the sprinter's role in his downfall -- did he knowingly 
take anabolic steroids and understand what they were for, or was he led astray 
by his own entourage? 
Johnson, 27, will be the 62nd witness to appear before the inquiry, which has 
already heard 56 days of testimony.
