FT  04 JAN 94 / Graduates 'will be able to demand more'
Graduates in future will be able to demand more for their skills due to a
dwindling supply of job seekers from universities, a report said yesterday.
Researchers from Sheffield University told the British Psychological
Society's occupational conference that a survey of 176 managers and
personnel specialists had shown a 'considerable degree of ignorance' about
demographic changes in the numbers of young people. The report said this
raised serious doubts about UK businesses' abilities to recruit, train and
develop managers for the future.
Less than a fifth of respondents realised that there would be about a 30 per
cent fall in the number of 20 to 24-year-olds entering the labour force
towards the end of the decade.
Thirty-six per cent of managers severely underestimated the extent of the
reduction and 18 per cent either believed there would be no change in the
numbers of young people entering the jobs market or that there would be an
increase.
The report said better and more reliable selection methods would be needed
for the 1990s. Forty-four per cent said they would readily agree to pay
higher salaries to attract and retain graduates.
The vast majority of the respondents still used interviews in graduate
selection, most used ability tests and almost all followed up references.
Three-quarters of the sample said they would pay greater salaries to attract
and keep high calibre staff. More than a third of employers, however, said
they recognised the potential of redeploying retired people as a means of
overcoming the shortfall in the number of young people.
The report said: 'These findings clearly indicate a growing number of
organisations will undoubtedly seek to raise the financial stakes in an
attempt to attract skilled labour at a time when such labour is in very
short supply.'
