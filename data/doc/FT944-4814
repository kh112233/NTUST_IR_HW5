Mr Paul Hill, former minister and US anti-abortion activist, was sentenced

jury of the fatal July 29 shooting of Dr John Britton and his clinic escort,
Mr John Barrett, outside the Ladies Centre abortion clinic in Pensacola,
Florida. In a separate federal court trial, Mr Hill was convicted of
violating a new US law that guarantees access to abortion clinics. He was
sentenced to life in prison.
