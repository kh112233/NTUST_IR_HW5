MOTHER TERESA GETS PACEMAKER, IS 'FINE' 
Mother Teresa underwent surgery Friday to receive a pacemaker, and hundreds of 
nuns of her Missionaries of Charity prayed for her recovery. 
The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun, who suffered a heart attack in September, 
was reported to be resting comfortably after the operation. 
"The permanent pacemaker is working fine," said Dr. Rajen Watts, her personal 
physician. "Mother Teresa had a mild bout of fever in the afternoon, but now it 
is under control. She is under constant observation, but we can say that she is 
fine now." 
Mother Teresa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work among the 
poor, was hospitalized Sept. 5, and suffered a heart attack three days later.
