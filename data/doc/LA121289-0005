QUAKE ASSISTANCE 
During the days following the Northern California earthquake, The Salvation 
Army received hundreds of thousands of dollars and literally tons of donated 
items: food, clothing, tents, flashlights and batteries, generators -- the list 
is endless. 
To those of you in Southern California who gave so generously, I want to offer 
my sincerest thanks for your support. Already your aid has assisted in helping 
serve over 6,000 meals daily to those left homeless, countless other meals to 
police, firefighters and rescue workers, clothing, tents, blankets and food to 
those in need. One hundred percent of the funds donated for quake relief go 
directly to our ongoing work in Northern California. 
Because of the generosity of Southern Californians, those in Northern 
California are able to rebuild their lives. The need is great and the work 
continues. Because of your help, we are able to bring comfort and assistance to 
our neighbors. May God bless you.
