  [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has lashed out 
at the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] for accusing 
it of rewarding terrorism. This follows reports of Robert 
McBride's nomination to the ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region's election list. McBride, who planted a 
bomb at Magoo's Bar in Durban, is the second most popular 
candidate on the ANC's list. The AVF has called McBride a mass 
murderer. It says his popularity follows what the AVF calls the 
already alarming reemergence of convicted kidnapper Winnie 
Mandela. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus says McBride is working 
hard for peace: 
  [Begin Niehaus recording] Comrade McBride is making a very 
important contribution to work for peace in the eastern parts of 
Johannesburg, and he has been particularly strongly involved in 
helping to work for peace in areas such as Thokoza and 
Katlehong. In contrast the AVF, and specific members of that 
Volksfront, has consistently, despite the fact that they have 
the right to participate in negotiations, despite the fact that 
those people that they represent have throughout the history of 
this country had the vote, threatened with violence and with 
civil war. [end recording] 
  Niehaus says the ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region nominations for the provincial legislature 
and the National Assembly include top ANC members. He says 
among them are Paul Mashatile, Obed Bapela, Tokyo Sexwale, and 
Ronnie Mamoepa. Niehaus says the nominations are provisional 
names: 
  [Begin Niehaus recording] There is also a number of people 
who have been nominated by the PWV region for the National 
Assembly. Among these people are Janet Love, who is the deputy 
director of the Transitional Executive Council, and there are 
also a considerable number of other senior members of the ANC 
that have been nominated. The person who appears on the list as 
the most popular candidate for the provincial legislature of the 
PWV region is Obed Bapela. [end recording]
