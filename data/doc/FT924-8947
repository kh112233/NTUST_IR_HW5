FT  09 NOV 92 / Colombia declares state of emergency
PRESIDENT Cesar Gaviria declared a national state of emergency yesterday
after leftist rebels detonated more than 30 bombs across Colombia, killing
at least nine people and wounding 60, AP reports from Bogota.
Mr Gaviria made the announcement after calling an emergency Security Council
meeting with his cabinet yesterday to discuss measures to combat Colombia's
35-year-old rebel insurgency.
The state of emergency will last for 90 days, in which the government will
take extraordinary powers: Mr Gaviria will be able to order actions against
rebels without consulting Congress or the courts.
Before the meeting, Mr Gaviria's interior minister, Humberto de la Calle
Lombana, said the guerrilla attacks were unprecedented and called for a
state of emergency.
Earlier yesterday the president said: 'It's now the hour to confront,
without truces - in the military, judicial and legislative fields, and with
the support of citizens - those who have become the worst criminals of the
country.'
Leftist rebels of the Simon Bolvar Guerrilla Co-ordinator movement began an
offensive on Saturday, killing 26 policemen who were protecting oil drills
at a petroleum field in southern Colombia.
Drug dealers have also targeted police. They have killed 20 officers in the
past 10 days.
The Bolvar group comprises the three remaining rebel factions: the National
Liberation Army, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and a dissident
faction of the Peoples' Liberation Army.
