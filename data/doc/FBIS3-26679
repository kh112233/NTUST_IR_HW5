  [Text] Sanaa, February 12 (XINHUA) -- Three Yemeni gunmen 
kidnapped at noon today three Chinese experts working on a road 
construction project. 
  The three Chinese, the head of a Chinese technical team 
executing the Jahaffa-Maareb Road Construction Project, the 
chief engineer and the assistant manager of the project, were 
kidnapped 47 kilometers away from the city of Jahaffa. 
  XINHUA correspondent learned from a reliable source that the 
three Yemeni kidnappers have made two conditions for freeing
