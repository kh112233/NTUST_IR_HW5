  [Text] Taipei, March 17 (CNA) -- The Executive Yuan, or 
cabinet, on Thursday [17 March] endorsed an amendment to the 
Wildlife Conservation Law as part of the government's efforts to 
stave off trade boycott pressure from the international 
community. 
  The revised law, pending the approval of the Legislative 
Yuan, stipulates that without the permission of relevant 
government authorities, endangered wildlife and endangered 
wildlife products may not be traded or displayed at public 
places. 
  Anyone found guilty could face penalties up to five years in 
jail or a fine of up to NT$1.5 million [New Taiwan dollars] 
(US$56,820). Repeat offenders could be sentenced up to seven 
years or fined up to NT$2.5 million. 
  Executive Yuan officials have been working nights in an 
effort to finish screening the revised law, hoping that it can 
be admitted to the legislature for final approval by March 20, a 
deadline previously set by the United States. 
  US Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit announced in mid-1993 
that 
Taiwan, along with several other countries, had only 
perfunctorily cracked down on the illegal trade of rhino horn 
and tiger bone, and threatened to hit Taiwan with sanctions. 
  US President Bill Clinton later postponed the deadline 
Clinton will announce at the end of this month whether to effect 
sanctions against Taiwan. [sentence as received] 
  The US is linking its boycott decision to a fact-finding 
report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered 
Species (CITES), which is charting Taiwan's progress in cracking 
down on the trade. 
  It is reported that CITES, now gathering in Jerusalem, is 
mulling the possibility of recommending that the United States 
go ahead with a boycott. 
  According to a CNA dispatch from Israel two days ago, Murray 
Hosking, director of the CITES Standing Committee, in his speech 
to the CITES Asian regional conference, pointed out that he 
hopes more substantial results come out before a meeting of the 
CITES Standing Committee opens in Geneva on March 21.
