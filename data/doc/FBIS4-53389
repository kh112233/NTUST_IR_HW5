  [Text] Belawan, N. Sumatra, May 18 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- The 
Malacca and Philip straits with a high density of international 
sea traffic, were now free from "traditional" piracy, a 
high-ranking Indonesian naval officer said. 
  "There have been no pirates attacking tankers in the Malacca 
Strait since 1992," commander of the Western Armada Rear Admiral 
Arief Kushariadi told the press in Belawan Tuesday. 
  Taking part in a "sea security safari," the two-star admiral 
said the success of the navy in maintaining security in the 
Malacca Strait was thanks to integrated sea patrol operations 
with the support of the sea patrols of Malaysia and Singapore. 
  He said in most cases the local pirates in their actions 
normally used sharp and pointed weapons such as machetes and 
sickles, not firearms. 
  When asked on the hardware and facilities owned by the 
Indonesian Navy in support of security operations in Indonesian 
territorial waters which formed two thirds of Indonesia's total 
national territory, he said they were quite adequate. 
  "However, ideally, we should have 400 warships to maintain 
security in our vast territorial waters, but those we already 
have are actually sufficient to do the job," he said.
