FT  25 MAR 94 / Cancer map shows regional contrasts
Striking regional variations are revealed by the first atlas of cancer
incidence in England and Wales, published yesterday, Clive Cookson writes.
The atlas, commissioned by the Cancer Research Campaign, shows that lung
cancer, the most common form of the disease in men, is much more prevalent
in the north than in the south. The reverse is true for breast cancer, the
most common cancer in women.
Dr Isabel Silva and Dr Anthony Swerdlow of the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine analysed information about 3m new cancer patients between
1968 and 1985 to give a county-by-county variation in cancer risks. They
compared these with the geographical distributions of risk factors such as
smoking and occupation. The figures in the map above are an index of the
number of new cases in each county over the period.
In some cancers there is an obvious link with risk factors. The north-south
gradient in lung cancer is caused mainly by the greater prevalence of
smoking in the north. The authors say that greater industrial exposures to
smoke, dust and toxic fumes in the north are not sufficient to account for
the regional differences.
Malignant melanoma, the most virulent skin cancer, has a strong south/north
gradient - someone living on the south coast is three times more likely to
suffer than someone in northern England. There is a clear correlation with
hours of sunshine.
The reason why breast and ovarian cancers are more common in the south is
not obvious. The fact that southern women have fewer children on average may
be a partial explanation, Drs Silver and Swerdlow say, because they have
higher levels of the hormones related to these cancers.
