  [Abstract] Protein hydrolysates with low phenylalanine 
content represent the principal component of the protein diet of 
children suffering from phenylketonuria, a disease associated 
with a congenital disorder of the phenylalanine metabolism and 
the result of genetic blocking of the oxidation of that amino 
acid into tyrosine. Devising low-phenylalanine diets that use 
proteins of plant or animal origin capable of countering that 
problem is difficult because phenylalanine shows up in all 
nutritional proteins in rather large quantities. The primary raw 
material for producing low-phenylalanine hydrolysates is casein, 
which is easily assimilated by a child's body and is readily 
available. Casein undergoes specific enzymatic hydrolysis for 
what is possibly the most complete release of phenylalanine from 
the polypeptide chain, the phenylalanine then being removed from 
the hydrolysate with a number of techniques. The researchers 
here developed optimum parameters for the targeted enzymatic 
hydrolysis of casein. Much of the phenylalanine was removed from 
the hydrolysate via adsorption on activated charcoal, 
ion-exchange resins, or molecular sieves. After adsorption on 
activated charcoal, the phenylalanine content was 0.3 mg/ml or 
less, which makes possible the production of dry preparations 
with a phenylalanine content of about 1 mg/ml. Figures 2,
