  [Text] The Interior Ministry's security forces have imposed 
strict security measures around the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, 
the Academic Center, and the Jewish cemetery in the city center. 
Security sources said that these measures were taken as a 
precaution against reactions to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre 
in Hebron. 
  The security sources also imposed strict security measures 
around the houses of the Israeli diplomatic mission members and 
put up barricades on all the roads leading to the embassy. 
Passersby were subjected to exhaustive searches. 
  AL-WAFD learned that Israeli Ambassador David Sultan has 
issued instructions to the Jewish and diplomatic community in 
Cairo advising them to be cautious in their movements. 
  A responsible source at the Interior Minister asserted that 
these are precautionary measures to prevent acts of revenge. 
  A state of alert was also announced at Cairo International 
Airport yesterday for fear of violent acts against Israeli 
delegations coming to or leaving Cairo. The airport authorities 
imposed strict security measures inside the passenger lounges 
and on the Israeli airline EL AL flights and with luggage checks.
