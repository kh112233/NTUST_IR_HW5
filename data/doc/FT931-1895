FT  23 MAR 93 / Greek current account gap wider despite rise in tourism
GREECE'S current account deficit widened by 33.4 per cent to Dollars 2.03bn
(Pounds 1.42bn) last year, despite a marked increase in tourism earnings and
high levels of European Community transfers.
The trade deficit worsened by 12.5 per cent, to Dollars 13.84bn, with export
earnings covering less than one-third of import payments.
According to central bank officials, the larger-than-expected deficit
reflected the effects of last autumn's upheaval on European currency
markets. The government had forecast a current account shortfall of Dollars
1.6bn for 1992, based on reduced growth in imports as economic stabilisation
continued.
Imports jumped sharply in October in response to fears that the drachma
would be devalued, while foreign currency inflows were held back. Imports
totalled Dollars 19.85bn in 1992, a 3.9 per cent rise.
The government's strong drachma policy, tying the currency to the D-Mark, is
blamed for an 11.6 per cent decline in export earnings to Dollars 6.01bn.
Greek products grew less competitive towards the end of 1992 after the lira
and peseta were devalued.
However, the invisibles surplus improved by 9.5 per cent last year, thanks
to a record number of tourist arrivals. Receipts from tourism, still
Greece's biggest single source of foreign exchange earnings, surged by 27.3
per cent to Dollars 3.27bn.
Remittances from Greeks living abroad rose more slowly, by 9.5 per cent to
Dollars 2.37bn.
EC transfers remained steady at Dollars 4.06bn, equivalent to almost 5 per
cent of Greece's gross domestic product. While two-thirds of Greek income
from the Community covers support payments to farmers, the government has
grown more efficient at tapping EC structural funds, drawing down more than
90 per cent of available funding last year.
