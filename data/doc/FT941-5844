FT  04 MAR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Relief in sight for asthma
victims
Researchers at the University of Southampton have devised a way of using
electrostatic polymer fibres to relieve the suffering to asthma victims
caused by dust mites, the minute creatures which inhabit beds and soft
furnishings.
The fibres, known as electrets, have a permanent electrical charge and so
trap the mites and their droppings by electrostatic attraction.
Because the fibres are both positively and negatively charged, the charges
balance out and so the resulting fibres do not produce the 'cling' or
electrical shock often associated with man-made fibres.
The university's patents are for woven and compact materials to be used in
mattress and duvet covers and for fibres to be interwoven in carpets.
