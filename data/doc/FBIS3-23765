<H3>  Who Is Leading Us Now? What Do We Have? Where Are We Going? 
How Are We To Become Happy? </H3>
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, let us talk about cadres and, 
of 
course, your cadre policy. Who leads us, where, and how, mainly 
depends on you and your decisions. Let us return to our recent 
past for a while. The Supreme Council gave a vote of no 
confidence in the government and in its head, Leonid Kuchma. The 
latter held on for 11 months in the position of prime minister, 
and later, when he was brought down, began to declare that in 
your entourage and that of Ivan Plyushch and other ranking 
leaders he encountered meanness, slyness, and so on. This is his 
business. 
  [Kravchuk] Yes. However, I think that he had also 
encountered 
such things before. 
  [Zholdak] Let him say it. So it is--an impotent government. 
He was removed; he was unable to implement changes for the 
benefit of Ukraine. Logically, new people should have come in, 
all the more so because you personally undertook to put together 
a team of ministers and their prime minister. However, you kept 
all the old cadres, with the exception of Morozov and Herts. 
Such logic is incomprehensible. Will these leaders who together 
with Kuchma botched up reforms in Ukraine be better working with 
you? Did you deliberately agree to personally being dragged down 
by them, too? 
  [Kravchuk] No, this was not the issue. You see, had the 
Supreme Council not made the decision on early elections we 
would have duly submitted this to that same Supreme Council. I 
am not the only one to form the government. The Supreme Council 
does so together with the president. 
  [Zholdak] Pardon me, Mr. President, I am asking you about 
why 
you took the old government which does not have the respect of 
the people. 
  [Kravchuk] Because it is impossible to form a new government 
for four months. There is managerial experience. No less than 
four months is needed for one to become a minister who knows at 
least something in a specific area. Had everybody been replaced 
at the same time, the ministers would have only been learning 
their jobs for the entire four months, or until the very 
elections. How would we have governed then, how would we have 
controlled the situation? The issue now is to control the 
situation and create conditions for transformations, to prevent 
slipping into an abyss, as you put it, or further still. Not 
everybody understands what it means to be in the government and 
to think every day about where to find $100 in order to pay for 
gas and oil, pay retirement benefits, and so on. These are the 
existing realities. Everybody may now be blamed--the president, 
the government, and there are grounds for such accusations. 
However, a way out of the situation should be found. Let us look 
for it. 
  [Zholdak] How do you look for it? 
  [Kravchuk] Let us look for it together. A congress of 
industrialists met today, and is meeting now. Proposals are 
being developed there that will be discussed together with the 
government. Decisions will be made. A search is on in 
ministries, departments, and international organizations. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, how could this have 
happened.... 
Here you are, an economist. Well, not that prominent an 
economist, correct? 
  [Kravchuk] Of course. 
  [Zholdak] However, you know the essence of the matter. Look, 
two years have already passed, and nobody has been able to 
develop an economic program for overcoming the crisis. Why has 
it happened this way? Why do we lack any kind of clear bearings? 
If only we were successful in something, had stopped something. 
  [Kravchuk] Seven programs have been approved by our Supreme 
Council. There are seven programs, but not one of them is being 
carried out. 
  [Zholdak] How about finding just one and doing it properly? 
We have an Academy of Sciences. For many years we have had its 
invariable President Paton whom, excuse me, you kiss and hug. He 
should have retired long ago. Meanwhile, you support him. He was 
a Shcherbytskyy man in his time. 
  [Kravchuk] I have my own idea of Paton, regardless of whose 
man he was. He has done very much for the academy. The academy 
is holding up at present, too. He has great authority in the 
world. 
  [Zholdak] New cadres should come along. One cannot head the 
same establishment for 32 years, correct? 
  [Kravchuk] The scientists themselves determine who to elect 
and who to respect. This is not up to me or you. 
  [Zholdak] However, there was not even an alternative. You 
were there. 
  [Kravchuk] No, I was not present at the election, and even 
if 
I had been I would not have influenced the election in any way. 
We are democrats, after all. Or do you have a different position? 
  [Zholdak] Democrats we are. Now about something else. We 
have 
the Institute of Economics. Do scientists really work there who 
merely await advance pay dates and paydays? There were economic 
councils under you, too. Look, Markulov appeared to be sensible, 
but now he has slammed the door. 
  [Kravchuk] Oh no, he did not slam the door. He simply took 
another job on his own initiative. Everybody has such a right. 
  [Zholdak] Why can you not gather together the wisest 
economists here, lock them in the same room for a month, and 
tell them: You will sit here until you come up with the right 
way--or bring in foreign economists? I may be putting it 
primitively.... 
  [Kravchuk] You know, at present I want just one thing, that 
you take my place and try to do everything you are saying. Then 
we would meet with you a month later, and I would ask you about 
the same, and I would not get an answer. I understand you. I do 
not have any complaints or hold grudges against anyone. The 
people also think the same way you do. 
  [Zholdak] Yes. We have been tinkering for two years, and 
have 
not been able to produce anything. 
  [Kravchuk] Well, look. Our economy.... We are frequently 
compared with Poland, the Czech Republic, or Slovakia. They 
could do it, it is said, and we cannot. They had their own 
states, their own complete economies. 
  [Zholdak] I will tell you why. I am not an economist. 
  [Kravchuk] Why? 
  [Zholdak] Because our state has control of 90 percent of 
enterprises and kolkhozes. Let them go! 
  [Kravchuk] It is not just that. Let me now show you some 
interesting data. 
  (He went over to his desk and picked up a printed sheet 
of paper with black and white marks.) 
  [Kravchuk] This is a privatization table from an 
international magazine. Look at the private sector. White marks 
denote 70 percent. Look at Austria. More than 70 percent has 
been privatized there--oil and coal. The rest belongs to the 
state. Black marks denote more than 70 percent of the "public 
sector." 
  [Zholdak] State-owned. 
  [Kravchuk] Public. So, look. There are states in which 
everything is in the "public sector." Brazil. Here is Great 
Britain--almost everything is in the "public sector" in the 11 
sectors named. 
  [Zholdak] Is that so? 
  [Kravchuk] France--almost everything in the "public sector." 
More than 70 percent. What are the sectors? Postal service, 
telecommunications, power supply, gas, oil, coal, railways, road 
construction, and steamship lines. Here are the main ones.... 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Eleven leading sectors--the 
"public sector." 
  [Zholdak] Let us look at America. 
  [Kravchuk] It has its own peculiarities. The level of 
privatization is the highest there. 
  [Zholdak] Here, look. Everything is white in America. 
  [Kravchuk] Not everything, but almost everything. 
  [Zholdak] And what about Japan? More white marks. 
  [Kravchuk] There are more white marks. Let us take Germany. 
You see, there are more black marks. I am driving all the time 
at privatization not being the only way out of the situation. 
The main point is for all forms of ownership to be equal, for 
equal conditions to be created for all. It cannot be that the 
director of state enterprises would pay wages of 200,000, and a 
commercial establishment next door--2 million. Conditions should 
be equal for all, for all forms. However, I agree with you that 
the state cannot carry the weight of the trade sector, consumer 
services, small enterprises, the garment and light industry, 
agriculture.... However, there is collective property, too. 
  [Zholdak] Agriculture is precisely what I am very much 
interested in. It is a fact that the financial and credit system 
of the country has broken down. I am saying this, and you will 
object, but I will now prove it to you. 
  [Kravchuk] I am not saying no. I am saying that it has 
broken 
down. 
  [Zholdak] All right. The current crop of agricultural 
products confirms this. Look, the state has ordered these 
products. The state was supposed to buy them. It also promised 
kolkhoz members resources on a preferential basis. The state has 
now gone bankrupt, it has taken all the grain, but has not paid 
either the billions or the trillions. In a conversation with me, 
Ivan Stepanovych confirmed that these are trillions. And the 
state is not paying back. This is the question for you, Leonid 
Makarovych. 
  [Kravchuk] Why not paying back? It is paying. 
  [Zholdak] Mere drops. It is not paying back. 
  [Kravchuk] It is. The state is paying back, albeit with 
difficulty, and will pay back. A different system for relations 
between the state and the agrarian sector has been approved for 
1994. It is supposed to ensure a new approach in order to 
somehow resolve these acute problems gradually. 
  [Zholdak] Mr. President, Academician Ihor Yukhnovskyy, who 
is 
also the political commentator of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA, has 
proposed to lay taxes in kind on farms. He has informed you. In 
this case, the state will have an abundance of foodstuffs 
without spending money, just for taxes in kind. For example, I 
operate my own farm, and I am supposed to give the state 
one-third of the crop, depending on the quality of land. What is 
your view of this? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, this should be calculated. This idea of 
Ihor 
Rafayilovych should be worked on. 
  [Zholdak] A farm could give the state a certain established 
proportion of grain or meat per hectare. It would be interested 
in increasing the output of products because a fixed, unchanged 
tax would be established. The greater the crop grown by 
peasants, the more they get to keep. This is advantageous to all. 
  [Kravchuk] However, this is natural economy rather than the 
market. This should be calculated properly. 
  [Zholdak] So, you approve of this idea? 
  [Kravchuk] As an idea that should be studied well, an expert 
analysis of which should be made. 
  [Zholdak] Leonid Makarovych, this is a painful question--how 
are we to get rid of speculators at every step we take? Can we 
really not give Minister of Internal Affairs Andriy Vasylyshyn 
the right to at least scare these middlemen? In the times of the 
communist era there was never such rapacity and fraud on our 
streets and squares next to railway terminals, as we have now. 
Those who tried to resell merchandise from stores were put 
behind bars right away. Now this is free, big business. If only 
they were peddling their own products. 
  [Kravchuk] Previously if they caught someone, they did not 
look at the law. They caught them and put them in prison right 
away. 
  [Zholdak] And why do Vasylyshyn's people not do it this way 
now? 
  [Kravchuk] Everybody must act in keeping with the law, and 
there should be good laws. 
  [Zholdak] The law is what it is, but if a store salesman 
passes, for example, detergents to "his people" through the back 
door, and these goods are sold at four to five times their 
price, is this not a crime? 
  [Kravchuk] Can you prove it? 
  [Zholdak] Next to the Ukraine department store in Kiev, 
close 
to the stop of street car No. 1, plump women sell one package at 
13,000-14,000; in the shop this merchandise costs 3,000, but it 
is not available. It is simple to prove that the street peddler 
did not manufacture the detergent powder herself. 
  [Kravchuk] She will say: "I bought it, and now I do not need 
it. And you do not have to buy it." There should be normal 
provisions and arrangements for their application, although the 
law enforcement organs are not doing everything by far. There 
are also other problems of democracy. For example, you bought a 
product in another country and brought it in for sale. You set a 
price. Those who want it, buy it, and those who do not, do not. 
This is your right. How is this speculation? This should not be 
put simply and primitively: If I am selling, this amounts to 
speculation. I agree with you on something else: If you buy 
something in a store and then go out and sell it right away, I 
am against it. However, this should be translated into law. If 
you follow closely the meetings of the Coordination Council for 
Combating Organized Crime, Minister Vasylyshyn and his guys are 
already doing nothing but this in order to cleanse our streets 
and squares in front of railway terminals from impudent 
middlemen. There is one more point: If economic conditions are 
not created, you will first establish control over yourself, and 
over the one who controls, and this chain may go on to the point 
of absurdity, because nobody has yet defeated either speculation 
or other criminal affairs by administrative legal control alone. 
  [Zholdak] Well, this did not happen during the communist 
era, 
comrade former secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine 
Central Committee. I maintain this as a former member of the 
CPSU. 
  [Kravchuk] There was another system, a system of a 
totalitarian regime. Pressure and lawlessness were the 
foundation of politics. 
  [Zholdak] Is anything at all allowed now? 
  [Kravchuk] No. 
  [Zholdak] Nonetheless, how are we to find bearings for the 
people so that they will live honestly and happily? 
  [Kravchuk] There is a way out. We should make a transition 
to 
such living conditions that it will no longer be advantageous 
for people to resell. 
  [Zholdak] It will not be advantageous when everything that 
we 
need appears in stores. 
  [Kravchuk] This is what it is about. I know from your 
writings that you have been to Paris. Tell me, did you see 
speculators on the streets and squares over there? Or did you 
see these shacks and stands with which the oblast seats, 
especially Kiev, are strewn? 
  [Zholdak] Paris and Kiev are not in the same league. 
  [Kravchuk] It will also be like this here. Ukraine will 
definitely become as rich as, say, France. Time is needed. The 
skill of economic management of our people is still the main 
point. I have met with the former president of Turkey, Ozal. He 
told me the following story: "Well, our flocks of sheep were 
driven to Iran all the time. We could not do anything. We set up 
borders, brought in the police, imprisoned the guilty 
executives, and so on. Nothing worked. However, what did we do 
later? We increased prices for our wool and hides. Prices became 
higher than in Iran. The sheep began to come over to us from 
there." Only economic instruments may really influence our 
situation. You see, there are 52 million people, and each of 
them wants to find his niche in life, including an economic 
niche. This is why it is impossible for General Vasylyshyn to 
assign a controller to everyone. 
  [Zholdak] It is so, Leonid Makarovych. However, when I see 
this abominable speculation in the streets (they even resell 
Polit cigarettes) my heart bleeds for the honest people who are 
being fleeced in this ungodly manner. They make millions in one 
or two days. May your heart bleed. We should fight such evil 
resolutely, after all. 
  [Kravchuk] Not only my heart bleeds. I do not want my heart 
to bleed.... 
  [Zholdak] I am saying this figuratively. 
  [Kravchuk] I understand; I want real work to be done. What 
we 
are now doing together with Minister Vasylyshyn and head of the 
SBU [Security Service of Ukraine] Marchuk is real. And we do it 
with the border guard, the national guard, and customs agents. 
There is material to disseminate. Consider this, Mr. Editor in 
Chief, and I would advise you to inform the people in your 
esteemed newspaper. This will benefit everyone. 
  [Zholdak] We have already established contact with General 
Valeriy Hubenko, commander of the border guard troops, and the 
head of our state customs, Mr. Anatoliy Kolos. We will provide 
information continuously. 
  [Kravchuk] Rightly so. I would like you and everyone to 
understand one thing: One may work by using these methods on a 
temporary basis. Why does this not exist in other countries? We 
want to prevent this under our circumstances. Meanwhile, our 
efforts should now be focused on production, without ruling out 
the fight against speculation. I talk about it all the time. 
Production is falling, but we want to live better. 
  [Zholdak] So, why is production not growing? 
  [Kravchuk] Production will increase if the state provides 
the 
conditions, and we are now working on it; this is the main 
point. However, second, when people begin to work as they 
should. Here is a simple and at the same time complex way out of 
the crisis for you and for all of us. 
<H5>  Will There Be Communism in an Isolated Oblast? </H5>
  [Zholdak] Mr. President, some power structures in certain 
regions of Ukraine are looking for another way out of the 
crisis. In short: As I see it, an intensified campaign from 
Russified oblasts in favor of the so-called experimental 
economic separation from the state strikes a blow at our 
independence. The Crimea has already been let go; the leaders of 
Transcarpathia have impudently come even to the Supreme Council, 
and the latter, instead of refusing to even hear about their 
separatism, up and began to discuss it and take votes. This 
"independence" petition nearly passed. Odessa with its Mr. 
Bodelan also plans to build communism in the "isolated Odessa 
region." Donetsk wants the same. Characteristically, Leonid 
Makarovych, all these authorities are former oblast-level 
Communist leaders. So, who is pulling apart our state? 
  [Kravchuk] Let us first determine what "separatism" is.
