p. Scoping Process: In gathering background information for 
preparation of the environmental document for the issuance 
of a Federal hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to 
identify significant environmental issues related to the 
construction and operation or the continued operation of 
hydropower projects. The staff will review all issues raised 
during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of 
study and also deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing 
the scope of the environmental analysis as well. If 
preliminary analysis indicates that any issues presented in 
the scoping process would have little potential for causing 
significant impacts, the issue or issues will be identified 
and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis 
will be given.
