 

International Trade Impact Statement




This proposed rule would not impose a competitive disadvantage to either U.S. air carriers doing business abroad
or foreign air carriers doing business in the United States. This assessment is based on the fact that this proposed
rule would not impose additional costs on either U.S. or foreign air carriers.




Regulatory Flexibility Determination



In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the FAA has determined that this proposed rule would not
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. This assessment
is based on the fact that the proposed rule would not impose any additional cost on aircraft operators.



Paperwork Reduction Act



There are no requirements for information collection associated with this proposed rule that would require approval
from the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96511).




Federalism Implications




The regulation proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposed rule does
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.


International Civil Aviation Organization and Joint Aviation Regulations



In keeping with the U.S. obligations under the Convention on International Civil Aviation (ICAO), it is FAA policy
to comply with ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARP) to the maximum extent practicable. The FAA has determined
that this NPRM complies with the ICAO SARP.



Conclusion



For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. This proposed regulation is not considered significant under
DOT Order 2100.5, Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). In addition, the FAA certifies that this
proposed regulation, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A regulatory evaluation of the NPRM,
including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the docket. A copy

Compliance with ATC clearances and instructions.



(a) When an ATC clearance has been obtained, no pilot in command may deviate from that clearance unless an amended clearance
is obtained, an emergency exists, or the deviation is in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system
resolution advisory. However, except in Class A airspace, a pilot may cancel an IFR flight plan if the operation is
being conducted in VRR weather conditions. When a pilot is uncertain of an ATC clearance, that pilot shall immediately
request clarification from ATC.

(c) Each pilot in command who, in an emergency, or in response to a traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS)
resolution advisory, deviates from an ATC clearance of instruction shall notify ATC of that deviation as soon as possible.
