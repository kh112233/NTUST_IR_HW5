  [Text] San Jose, 20 Mar (DPA) -- Costa Rican antinarcotics 
police are currently investigating possible connections of a 
drug trafficking group dismantled this past Friday in Alajuela, 
30 km west of San Jose, with the Colombian Pereira drug cartel. 
Colombian citizens Luis Carlos Diez Diez and Moises Nader 
Vargas, as well as Costa Rican citizen Carlos Alvarado were 
arrested during the police operation. According to the 
authorities, the group had smuggled approximately 720 kg of 
cocaine to Europe through Costa Rica. 
  Public Security Minister Luis Fishman said 17 Costa Rican 
nationals currently detained in Spain, Netherlands, Germany, 
Belgium, France, and Italy on drug trafficking charges could 
belong to this group. During the past six years, the Colombian 
drug cartels have used Costa Rica to transfer cocaine to the 
United States and Europe. It is estimated that between two and 
four tons of cocaine are being shipped monthly from Costa Rica 
despite government efforts to crack-down on drug trafficking. 
  Between 1992 and 1993, anti-narcotics agencies seized 
approximately 1,500 kg of cocaine. More than 100 foreigners, 
including several Colombians, are imprisoned in Costa Rican 
jails as a result of their links to drug trafficking.
