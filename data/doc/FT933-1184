FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (38): Enfeebled
giant burdened by debt - Africa / Only the return of foreign investment, in
partnership with a thriving private sector, will give the economy the boost
it needs
AFRICA AND its allies are in danger of losing the battle for the recovery of
a continent, now so weakened by years of adversity and mismanagement that it
cannot take full advantage of a stronger world economy.
More than a decade after the World Bank first sounded the alarm about
Sub-Saharan Africa's crisis, and despite some Dollars 170bn in net
development assistance that has followed, the region's problems remain
acute.
Economic reforms that got under way in the 1980s are not measuring up to
expectations, whether due to weak implementation by African governments,
inadequate incentives from western governments and agencies, or flaws in the
structural adjustment policy itself. And on the political front, the
democratisation process that raised hopes in the 1990s is proving divisive
rather than constructive, as ethnicity, rather than policies, determine
voters' allegiances.
Today, Africa is an enfeebled giant, poorer in per capita terms than it was
in 1960, and burdened by an external debt that has soared from Dollars 3bn
to more than Dollars 145bn, and which costs a quarter of export earnings to
service.
Wars in Angola, Sudan, Somalia and elsewhere continue to scar the continent,
foreign investment (outside the oil sector) is negligible, management is
weak, corruption widespread, and Aids is on the increase. 'It is the only
region in the world likely to experience an increase in absolute poverty
over the next decade,' Kim Jaycox, the World Bank's vice-president for
Africa, told his executive board last February.
Admittedly, Africa will do better in the 1990s than in the 1980s, if the
forecasters are correct. In its World Economic Outlook, published last May,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted real GDP growth at 3.3 per
cent in 1993-94, rising to 4.4 per cent a year between 1995 and 1998.
But the Fund was quick to hedge its bets: 'These projections are subject to
a wider margin of uncertainty than for other regions,' it warned, noting
that 'despite considerable progress in some countries, many obstacles to
stronger growth remain to be tackled, including inadequate infrastructure,
weak administrative capacity . . . and social and political instability.'
Given that Sub-Saharan Africa's four leading economies are all in
difficulties, the caveat is understandable. Nigeria is in the grips of a
political crisis, and its economic reform programme has effectively lapsed;
Kenya is faltering in its promise to root out corruption; the Ivory Coast
cannot implement an effective reform programme as long as the CFA franc
remains overvalued by as much as 30 per cent; and South Africa remains
plagued by political violence, likely to get worse not better as party
rivalries intensify in the run up to next April's general election.
Nevertheless, the IMF forecast may seem encouraging, compared with the
1980s, when growth over the decade averaged less than 2 per cent and per
capita income fell by more than 1 per cent.
The reality, however, is that this rate of growth will only stem, possibly
halt, the rate of Africa's overall decline, for it must be set against a
current population increase of 3.1 per cent annually - which, if sustained,
will double the region's population every 22 years.
Even the most successful example of reform provides a salutary warning of
the long battle ahead if Africa is to make up ground lost during the
disastrous post-independence era. Structural adjustment in Ghana has worked
 -but only up to a modest point. Real incomes per head have grown by an
average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in
the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. But at current
growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population), it would take
20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries.
One important lesson from Ghana is that aid is not enough. Only the return -
on a substantial scale - of foreign investment, in partnership with a
thriving private sector, will give Africa's economy the boost it needs. As
Kim Jaycox points out: 'Even if aid succeeded in generating annual growth
rates of 6 per cent on average, most African countries would still require
25 years to reach acceptable unemployment levels and Dollars 1,000 GDP per
capita. Only the private sector has any chance of achieving higher rates of
growth with greater speed.'
There is little evidence that foreign investors, who saw their rate of
return drop from some 30 per cent in the 1960s to just 2.5 per cent in the
1980s, are about to come back. Net foreign direct investment in Africa has
averaged around Dollars 500m a year over the past few years (mostly into the
oil and mining sectors), less than 1 per cent of the global total according
to the UN's World Investment Report.
Obstacles range from the poor state of the infrastructure in most countries
to the tough competition from other countries in the developing world, such
as Thailand, Indonesia or Vietnam. Above all, Africa has yet to convince the
outside world that it means business.
'Too many African countries have embraced economic reform too hesitantly,'
Sir William Ryrie, outgoing head of the International Finance Corporation
(IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, told a conference in
Nairobi in March this year.
Whether Africa and its allies are prepared to admit that defeat looms in the
battle for recovery remains to be seen. Since the Bank first sounded the
alarm, in its 1981 report, further warnings have come at regular intervals.
Africa 'faces acute economic difficulties', said the Bank's next appraisal,
published in 1984. Five years later the picture remained bleak. The Bank
looked back on 'a decade of falling per capita income' and concluded:
'Overall, Africans are almost as poor today (1989) as they were 30 years
ago.'
The Bank has been taking stock once again and, in a report due to be
published shortly, is expected to conclude that economic reforms have
stemmed the pace of decline. But at current rates of per capita GDP growth
it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of
the mid 1970s.
Given better implementation of reforms and an improved international
economic environment, and a renewed effort by the international community to
tackle Africa's crisis, prospects could change. But the critical question
remains whether African governments have the political will to adopt painful
economic reforms, or the managerial capacity with which to implement them.
But Africa's allies will also have to take fresh stock of their performance.
No development agency likes to admit failure, for it fears losing its raison
d'etre. No non-government organisation likes to acknowledge defeat, for fear
of funds drying up. No western government wants to add to its problems by
acknowledging that its aid policy is ineffectual. But only a frank appraisal
of the crisis can provide the basis of the fresh initiative the continent
desperately needs.
