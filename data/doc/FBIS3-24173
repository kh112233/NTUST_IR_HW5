Environment Loan"] 
  [Text] The World Bank through its subsidiary, the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC), has granted over 200 
million [Danish] kroner for modernizing and improving the 
environmental impact of a large cement plant in Estonia, AS 
Kunda Nordic Cement. The agreement is IFC's largest investment 
project in the former Soviet Union. 
  According to a preliminary agreement, around 56 million 
kroner of this amount will be used for expanding the harbor 
facilities in Kunda, while 50 million are earmarked for 
environmental improvements, including stronger filters. 
  The cement plant, which was built in the 1960's based on 
East 
German brown- coal technology, has for years been the area's 
greatest environmental threat, because the plant each hour 
unhindered has been spewing out 15 tons of cement dust up 
through its smokestacks -- corresponding to 10-15 percent of 
production. Converting this, it means that in 10 years enough 
cement to build two Great Belt bridges has fallen on the head of 
inhabitants of Kunda. 
  The Kunda plant currently is responsible for a third of 
Estonia's total air pollution, but after modernization is 
completed, it is expected that this level will drop to 1 or 2 
percent. At the same time, production is expected to double to 
900,000 tons annually. 
  The greatest part of production is expected to be earmarked 
for Western markets.
