  [Text] Moscow June 18 TASS -- "The North Korean [DPRK] 
Embassy in Moscow does not have to worry: None of its staffers 
have been `recently' expelled from Russia or will be expelled in 
the near future. The stir about diplomat-spies was caused by 
misinterpretation," head of the Federal Counterintelligence 
Service's public relations center Aleksandr Mikhailov told 
ITAR-TASS today commenting on media reports about the expel of 
North Korean Embassy staffers from Moscow. 
  In the words of Mikhailov, currently on a Far Eastern trip 
together with service head Sergey Stepashin, the latter has 
noted the recently-boosted intelligence activities of some 
secret services, including those of North Korea, China and 
Japan. Stepashin thinks a reason for this is the location of 
Russian nuclear-powered submarine fleet in the region. 
  As for the North Korean diplomats expelled for the attempts 
to purchase materiel, it was really so, said Mikhailov. The 
Russian counterintelligence, intelligence and border guards held 
an operation to prevent drug trafficking from the DPRK to Russia 
before the arrival of Stepashin in the Far East. Some could mix 
the two events which resulted in misunderstanding, said 
Mikhailov.
