FT  07 JUL 94 / Eurotunnel to appeal over ferry duty-frees
Eurotunnel, which runs trains through the Channel tunnel, is to challenge a
European Union decision allowing ferry companies and airlines to continue
making duty-free sales until 1999, Charles Batchelor writes.
The company intends to seek leave in the next few days to apply for a
judicial review in the autumn of the European decision. It believes that
duty-free sales are worth Pounds 125m a year to its rivals and abolition of
the duty-free concession would boost its turnover by about Pounds 170m up to
1999.
Eurotunnel said: 'This is a subsidy to the ferries and the airlines and we
see it as discrimination against us.'
If duty-free sales were abolished, the ferry companies would have to
increase ticket prices and travellers might be persuaded to transfer to the
tunnel.
Eurotunnel planned its services on the assumption that duty-free sales would
be abolished when the single European market was created in January 1993.
But the government lobbied for an extension of the concession and won a
six-year reprieve.
