FT  18 JUN 93 / UN orders Somali warlord arrest
THE UNITED Nations yesterday ordered the arrest and detention of General
Mohammed Farah Aideed after an attack on the Somali warlord's headquarters
in which five peacekeepers and an unknown number of Somalis died.
A UN spokesman in New York said Gen Aideed's militia had been driven from
its base and that the casualties occurred during 'really fierce battles
raging in the streets' of the capital, Mogadishu.
The whereabouts of Gen Aideed remained a mystery although it was reported he
was holed up in a hospital. Admiral Jonathan Howe, the UN special
representative in Somalia, said that safeguarding Somali civilians as well
as UN personnel required Gen Aideed's detention. French, Italian and
Pakistani UN forces were to undertake the operation, with the US providing
air support.
The move draws the UN forces further into the conflict which has ravaged the
African country. The UN said Gen Aideed's arrest was necessary pending an
investigation into an attack on Pakistani troops in Mogadishu on June 5 that
left 23 dead and many wounded. However, UN lawyers are unsure where and
under what law Gen Aideed, who has been accused of directing the attack,
would be prosecuted.
Early yesterday Gen Aideed's villa and the houses of two chief henchmen were
stormed by UN soldiers. Four Moroccans and one Pakistani were killed while
37 Moroccans, three Frenchmen, three Pakistanis and one American were
wounded.
The UN spokesman accused armed Somalis of hiding behind civilians and said
the Moroccans came under fire when confronted with a demonstration. The
city's two main hospitals said more than 60 people had been killed yesterday
and a further 100 wounded.
A representative of Action Internationale Contre la Faim, (AICF), a French
aid organisation, told France-Info radio from Mogadishu that a US Cobra
helicopter had fired two rockets into its office in the city, killing a
local employee and wounding six others.
