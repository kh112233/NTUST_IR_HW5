WOMAN KILLED, 5 INJURED IN VISTA AUTO ACCIDENT 
An unidentified woman was killed Saturday night in Vista when a car driven by a 
16-year-old San Marcos girl struck her and threw her about 40 or 50 feet, 
officials said. Another pedestrian, the driver and three passengers in the car 
were also injured. 
The teen-ager was eastbound on East Los Angeles Drive, traveling at least 50 
m.p.h., when she lost control of her convertible, struck two pedestrians and a 
fence, and crashed into a parked car and a light pole, Sheriff's Deputy Mark 
MacGregor said. 
The fatally injured woman, who was about age 30, and a companion were standing 
at the curb at about 9:25 p.m., looking for an address, Deputy Coroner Max 
Murphy said. 
He said she died of a broken neck and skull fractures. She was pronounced dead 
at the scene, officials said. Her female companion, who was also struck, was 
taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where she was listed in serious 
condition Sunday night, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
MacGregor said no identification was found on the pair. 
The driver of the vehicle had four other passengers in the car. All but one of 
them were ejected from the car. 
The driver suffered a broken collar bone and was admitted to Tri-City Medical 
Center in Oceanside. Passenger Judy Luce, 20, of Vista, was also admitted to 
Tri-City. Tina Landers, another passenger, was taken to Scripps in La Jolla, 
where she was in critical condition Sunday night, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
A male passenger, Efrain Orosco, 19, of Vista, did not appear to be injured at 
the scene but later complained of pain, MacGregor said. Another unidentified 
passenger was not injured, he said.
