The Food and Drug Administration said it planned a 98% reduction in the amount 
of lead permitted to reach beverages from ceramic pitchers because of new 
evidence that extremely small amounts of lead can hurt children. Lead at 
concentrations tolerable by adults can limit body growth and intelligence of 
children and can cause brain damage and behavior problems. Lead in pitchers 
comes from the glaze commonly used to make ceramics smooth and impervious. 
Officials are most concerned about acidic liquids such as orange juice eating 
away at the glaze and causing lead to leach. Small cream pitchers would not be 
subject to the new standard.
