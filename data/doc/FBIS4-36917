  [Text] Responding to a question regarding a news report 
published in a local English daily alleging the expulsion of two 
Pakistani diplomats from Germany, a Foreign Office spokesman 
said in Islamabad today that the report by German television was 
factually incorrect. No Pakistani diplomat has been expelled 
from Germany as asserted in the report. The spokesman said 
Pakistan is procuring a number of sophisticated items of [as 
heard] equipment from various sources. Normally, it is for 
supplier companies to obtain export license for restricted 
items. For its part, Pakistan seeks to scrupulously observe the 
export laws of the concerned countries. He said the report 
appears to be an attempt to sensationalize normal transactions.
