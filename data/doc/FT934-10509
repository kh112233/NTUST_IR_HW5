FT  05 NOV 93 / India's external debt rises to Dollars 85bn
INDIA'S external debts rose Dollars 3.2bn in the year to March to Dollars
85.4bn, largely because of an increase in loans from multilateral
development agencies.
The figures were set out in a Finance Ministry report yesterday aimed at
assuaging fears that India is in danger of running into a debt crisis.
Critics of the government's reforms have frequently attacked Mr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister, and his colleagues for allegedly bowing to
pressure from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other
lenders to take on debt which India cannot afford.
The report says the government is keeping a close watch on external debt.
'External indebtedness as such is not an evil as long as the debt incurred
is utilised efficiently. The stabilisation and structural reform measures
being pursued by the government will enable the economy to utilise external
loans efficiently and will enhance the capacity of the economy to repay the
loans through higher exports and invisible earnings.'
The report says India's external debts rose rapidly after the mid-1980s,
from Dollars 37.3bn in March 1986. Total debt as a proportion of GDP rose
from 17.5 per cent in 1985-86 to 40.2 per cent in 1991-92 before falling
slightly to 38.3 per cent last year. (Defence-related debt is excluded in
1985-86 and included in later years).
The ratio of debt service payments to exports and other foreign earnings
rose equally fast and stood at 30.4 per cent in the year ending last March.
Citing World Bank data, the report says that at the end of 1991, India's
ratio of debt to GNP was 29.2 per cent - compared with an average of 37.4
per cent for least-developed (ie poor) countries. The figure for
neighbouring Pakistan was 50 per cent. India is the world's fourth largest
debtor (after Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia).
