FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: RJR Nabisco expands into
Hungary
RJR NABISCO has made its biggest investment in eastern Europe, buying 87 per
cent of Satoraljaujhely Dohanygyar, the Hungarian state-owned cigarette
factory.
The acquisition allows the US to make 5.5bn cigarettes a year in north-east
Hungary close to the large and undersupplied Ukrainian market.
Satoraljaujhely Dohanygyar reported 1991 pre-tax profits of Ft123m (Dollars
1.6m) on sales of Ft4.8bn. Production volume represents about 20 per cent of
the Hungarian mar-ket.
The purchase was achieved against strong competition from Reemtsma, the
German tobacco company to which RJR Nabisco lost in the bidding for
Debreceni Dohanygyar, another Hungarian cigarette factory.
