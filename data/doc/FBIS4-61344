  [Text] Kiev 5 May TASS -- The press service of the 
Ukrainian Defence Ministry alleges that Russia is making plans 
to hijack the TU-22 missile-carrying aircraft from two Air Force 
regiments of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  A statement issued by the Ukrainian Defence Ministry says 
that the hijacking is planned to be carried out during next 
training exercises of the Black Sea Fleet Air Force. Commanders 
of the Second Naval Missile-Carrying Aircraft Division of the 
Black Sea Fleet Air Force are allegedly "making secret 
preparations for the operation," the press service said. 
  The press service declared that "any attempts to remove 
military hardware and other material values beyond the Ukrainian 
borders are illegal and will inevitably worsen the situation 
around the problem of the division of the Black Sea Fleet."
