  [Text] SAWT AL-SHA'B has received the following letter 
from the embassy of Palestine in Amman: 
  The Editor: 
  SAWT AL-SHA'B, on Sunday, 10 April, 1994, published a report 
about five of 'Arafat's companions being involved in a dollar 
forging operation, etc. 
  We would like to state that the report has no basis in truth 
and must have been fabricated by a sick mind in the context of a 
wicked effort steered by circles hostile to the PLO and its 
leadership. 
  We would like to make it clear that any actions prejudicial 
to the brotherly ties between the brother Tunisian and 
Palestinian peoples are the responsibility of the PLO's security 
services, in conjunction with brother Tunisians. Any practices 
that may discredit the PLO or abuse brother Tunisia's 
hospitality are handled in the same fashion.
