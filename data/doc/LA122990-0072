33 INJURED AS TROLLEYS COLLIDE; DRIVER TESTS POSITIVE FOR ALCOHOL 
A trolley car rammed into another trolley that was unloading commuters Friday 
morning in an underground station on the edge of Boston Common, injuring 33 
people, officials said. 
The driver of the moving trolley tested positive for alcohol in his blood. 
The accident involving the Green Line trains occurred at Arlington Station. The 
Green Line is one of four subway lines operated by the Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority. 
"I just screamed out: 'Everybody hang on and get down. We're going to hit,' " 
passenger Steve DePaula said. "It just seemed like seconds later we smashed 
into the trolley in front of us. People just went flying everywhere." 
DePaula said the moving trolley was going faster than usual. But Thomas Glynn, 
the transit authority's general manager, said officials did not know how fast 
the second car was going. 
"I was looking at the lady across from me; next thing I knew, the lights went 
out and she was on the floor," said Ernest Jones, a passenger on the stationary 
trolley. "I saw one man . . . on the floor on his back, crying, obviously in 
agony, hurt." 
The driver of the moving trolley told officials his brakes failed, Glynn said. 
Both operators, whose names were not released, underwent drug and alcohol tests 
immediately after the accident. 
"The driver in the rear car, the car that did the hitting, . . . was found to 
test positive for alcohol," a transit spokesman said. 
The driver was suspended without pay pending the outcome of an investigation, 
officials said. 
Most of the 33 people injured were treated and released at hospitals. One 
person was in intensive care at New England Medical Center.
