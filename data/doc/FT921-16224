FT  04 JAN 92 / UK Company News: ICI expected to benefit from breast cancer
study
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries is expected to benefit from the results of a
cancer study to be published today, details of which were revealed
yesterday.
The study carried out by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, concludes that
women with early breast cancer have a better chance of survival if they take
hormonal therapy. One of the main forms of hormonal therapy is an oestrogen
blocking drug called tamoxifen, which is sold by ICI under the brand name
Nolvadex.
Nolvadex, launched in 1973, is the largest selling cancer drug in the world
with a turnover of between Pounds 200m and Pounds 250m. ICI was not prepared
to comment on the study's potential impact on profits. The research involved
750,000 women throughout the world and lasted for five years.
Most UK analysts believed the study would be positive for ICI. Dr Jonathan
Gelles of US securities house Wertheim Schroder said: 'It will clearly
support further growth of this product. I would have thought that they
should be able to increase unit use by between 20 and 25 per cent.'
