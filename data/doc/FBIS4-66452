  [Text] The LP Gas Promotion Center, Inc. (board 
chairperson: Kazuo Okita) and Fuji Electric Co., Ltd. (Fuji 
Electric), have jointly developed a 100-kW-output, phosphoric 
acid-type, pilot fuel cell that uses butane as fuel. A 
precious-metal catalyst was used in the new cell to eliminate 
the previously inherent problem of short life for a modifying 
catalyst when burning butane. The new butane-burning fuel cell, 
if commercialized, is expected to become a popular 
dispersion-type power-source for factories, because butane is 
cheap and has been widely used as an industrial fuel. 
  The pilot fuel cell is in its last stage of construction at 
Chiba Plant (Ichihara City) of Fuji Electric and is expected to 
be completed by the end of 1993. In the cell, butane is first 
desulfurized in a fuel modifier and decomposed to hydrogen and 
carbon dioxide. This hydrogen undergoes reaction with oxygen 
taken in from the outside to generate direct current, which will 
be converted into alternate current by a converter. 
  During the period from January to March 1994, the fuel cell 
will be evaluated at Chiba Plant to see if it performs as 
designed. The cell's generation efficiency is expected to be 
approximately 40 percent, which is comparable to that of fuel 
cells that use natural or propane gas. The cost of the entire 
development is estimated to be approximately &yen;550 million. 
  In FY94, the test fuel cell will be moved to Niigata 
Terminal, which is the liquid petroleum gas (LPG) import-base 
for Nippon Petroleum Gas Co., Ltd. (Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo; 
president: Naoaki Nakano), a subsidiary of Nippon Oil Co., Ltd., 
for further evaluation of its operation. The generated 
electricity will be used at the base. It is anticipated that the 
cell will be in operation for 2,000 to 2,500 hours per year. 
  Although butane is cheaper than propane by about 10 percent, 
butane, when used for a fuel cell, has tended to quickly 
deactivate the catalyst in the modification step to generate 
hydrogen. 
  If a fuel cell can use butane, it can also use propane. 
Therefore, if commercialized, the new fuel cell is expected to 
grab a large market share. 
  Electric energy is generated by a fuel cell by the mechanism 
that is a reverse of the electrolysis of water. Fuel cells are 
promising power sources for urban areas because of little or no 
adverse impact, including air pollution of the environment. 
  There are three types of fuel cells. Among them, the 
phosphoric acid type is at the most advanced stage of 
development. Other studies concerning this type are currently 
being undertaken with natural gas, petroleum, methanol and coal 
as fuel.
