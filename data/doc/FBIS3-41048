first two sentences published in boldface] 
  [Text] By 17 November 1993, 603 tanks, 630 combat 
vehicles, and 175 aircraft had been destroyed in Ukraine. This 
is the result of the first stage of reductions completed by the 
Ukrainian Army in accordance with the agreement on Conventional 
Armed Forces in Europe. Over this period of time, more than 50 
inspectors' groups from countries that are signatories to the 
treaty visited Ukraine. 
  Since the beginning of 1994, four international inspectors' 
groups have already been here. They visited the Lvov, 
Nikolayev, Kiev, and Zhytomyr armor plants, at which 100 tanks 
and 60 armored combat vehicles will be eliminated in the very 
near future. Altogether, during this new stage of reductions, 
more than 600 tanks and more than 300 armored combat vehicles 
will have to be destroyed.
