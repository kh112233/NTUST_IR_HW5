FT  10 SEP 92 / Visit by Mother Teresa
MOTHER Teresa, the 82-year-old winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, went
house-hunting yesterday in Birmingham, where she plans to open a new branch
of her order, the Missionaries of Charity.
Mother Teresa, who won the Nobel Prize in 1979, arrived from Calcutta on
Friday. Nuns from her order have run missionary houses in London, Liverpool
and Glasgow since the 1970s, and almost 3,000 nuns carry out her work in
nearly 100 countries.
She told the Roman Catholic auxiliary Bishop of Birmingham, the Rt Rev
Philip Pargeter: 'Silver and gold I have not to give you, but I am sending
my sisters.'
The original plan was for the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Birmingham,
Maurice Couve de Murville, to take Mother Teresa on her property-viewing
tour, but he is on holiday.
Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace confirmed that the Princess of Wales had a
secret meeting with Mother Teresa in London at the weekend.
The palace said Mother Teresa had requested the meeting to thank the
princess for her visit to Rome in February.
