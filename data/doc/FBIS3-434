  [Text] Bujumbura, March 7 (AFP) - Up to 200 people were 
killed in weekend clashes with ethnic overtones between 
civilians and soldiers in an outlying district of Bujumbura, 
Radio Burundi reported Monday [7 March]. Witnesses said some 20 
bodies were brought out of the northern Kamenge district after 
fighting between civilians mainly of the Hutu majority, and the 
powerful army, which largely comprises the Tutsi minority. 
  Police said 40 people had been killed but the interior 
ministry said the death toll could be as high as 200, the radio 
said. Humanitarian aid sources said some of the civilians had 
firearms. 
  The rest of the capital was quiet, but the situation has 
been 
extremely unstable in Burundi since a section of the army 
mounted an unsuccessful coup in October against the Hutu 
government elected the previous June, killing President Melchior 
Ndadaye. An estimated 100,000 people were killed in ethnic 
clashes after the coup attempt and another 700,000 fled the 
country. 
  The reason for the latest shooting, which began Friday and 
intensified Saturday, was still unknown. 
  Two Italian doctors with the Belgian arm of the Medecins 
Sans 
Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) organisation were wounded 
Saturday as they drove through the district in a car, aid 
sources said. They said the atmosphere in Kamenge was still 
very tense, adding that the use of firearms by civilians is a 
comparatively recent phenomenon. 
  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it 
had evacuated three wounded people from the district Monday, on 
top of four brought out Saturday.
