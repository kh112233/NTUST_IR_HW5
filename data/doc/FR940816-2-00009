SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

The inventions available for licensing are:



NIST Docket No. 90026





Title: 

Novel Multifunctional Acrylates and the Synthesis Thereof.



Description: 

A new, facile synthetic technology developed at NIST makes available a wide range of hydrophobic and hydrophilic
multifunctional acrylic monomers and oligomers that are not readily available by other synthetic processes.



NIST Docket No. 93003 






Title: 

Method of Adhering Substrates.



Description: 

Two substrates can be joined together by exploiting the natural attraction between acidic and basic molecules. A
new acid-base bonding technique developed at NIST permits strong (yet reversible) adhesion without substantially
altering material properties near or across the interface.



NIST Docket No. 93036 





Title: 

Method of and Articles for Accurately Determining Relative Positions of Lithographic Artifacts.



Description: 

In the 21st century, making a 4-gigabit computer chip will require accurately stacking together many circuit layers
with nanometer-scale features. To help make such devices a reality, NIST researchers have developed a procedure
for measuring alignment flaws smaller than 10 nanometers.



NIST Docket No. 93054 





Title: 

A Procedure for Digital Image Restoration.



Description: 

A fast procedure to improve the deblurring of images incorporates a new type of a-priori constraint that sharply suppresses
noise contamination, is applicable in very diverse imaging contexts and requires only a workstation-sized computer.



NIST Docket No. 93060D 





Title: 

High Speed Amplitude Variable Thrust Control.



Description: 

A new NIST invention provides a means of precisely and rapidly varying the thrust produced by a high pressure fluid.
The control system uses a piezoelectric stack, displacement amplifier, and high pressure axial valve assembly.
A microprocessor (along with the associated energy storage and power amplifier system) can change the displacement
of the piezoelectric stack in as little as ten microseconds.
