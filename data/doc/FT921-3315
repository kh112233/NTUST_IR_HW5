FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Minister signs off with a row
MR Alan Clark, the minister for defence procurement, brought his ministerial
career in the Commons to a remarkable close last night by fiercely attacking
a Conservative colleague, Mr Hugh Dykes, MP for Harrow East.
A routine debate about the failure of GEC-Marconi, whose Stanmore
headquarters is in Mr Dykes' constituency, to secure the contract for the
new advanced short-range air-to-air missile system developed into a bitter
exchange of insults.
Mr Clark, a wealthy right-winger who is not seeking re-election as the MP
for Plymouth Sutton, admitted his 'idiosyncratic' behaviour had got him in
trouble in the past.
A gleeful Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover and sole occupant of the Labour
benches, encouraged the combatants while ministers, including Mr Richard
Ryder, Tory chief whip, looked on in silence.
When Mr Dykes opened the debate by underlining the importance of GEC-Marconi
to his constituency he complained that Mr Clark, who momentarily left his
seat to consult civil servants, was not listening.
Mr Clark said Mr Dykes had made his position absolutely clear by calling on
the prime minister to sack him in a 'full frontal' television programme.
