  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 11 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Thailand 
has assured Malaysia that its purchase of aircraft carriers is 
for defence purposes, Deputy Defence Minister Wan Abu Bakar Wan 
Mohamed said Monday. [passage omitted] 
  We understand the defence requirements of the Thais as they 
have got to patrol both the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman 
Sea, he told reporters after discussions with the Thai top brass. 
  Purchased as part of the RTN's modernisation programme, one 
of the helicopter carriers is already being built in Spain and 
is scheduled to be delivered in 1997. This will make Thailand 
the first country in the region to have such vessels. 
  Wan Abu Bakar said Malaysia had also offered RTN the 
facilities of the naval dockyard in Lumut for their vessels 
passing through the Melaka Strait. 
  Both counties, he added, would work together to enhance the 
level of cooperation, especially in joint exercises and in 
anti-piracy operations. [passage omitted]
