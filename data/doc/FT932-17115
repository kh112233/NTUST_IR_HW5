FT  02 APR 93 / Trials make grim news for sufferers: Shortcomings of Aids
drug revealed despite millions of pounds spent on research
FOR the 10m or so people worldwide infected with HIV but not yet showing
symptoms of Aids, the failure of the Concorde trial to demonstrate any
clinical benefit from early treatment with AZT is grim news.
No other drug available today can delay the onset of symptoms and the
immediate outlook is not encouraging, even though the international
pharmaceutical industry and government laboratories are spending more than
Pounds 1bn a year on Aids research.
AZT itself reached the market in March 1987, a record 2 1/2 years after
Wellcome researchers discovered its activity against HIV, the virus that
causes Aids. But no more anti-HIV drugs were licensed until last year when
DDI from Bristol-Myers Squibb of the US and DDC from Roche of Switzerland
were launched.
AZT, DDI and DDC are chemically similar drugs, called nucleoside analogues.
They all work by mimicking one of the natural building blocks of genetic
material. When HIV takes up one of the synthetic molecules, this jams the
mechanism by which the drug replicates.
The drugs slow down the rate at which HIV infects a patient's immune system
but they cannot eliminate the virus, let alone cure Aids. Their drawbacks
include toxic side-effects (bone marrow suppression in AZT's case) and the
development of viral resistance to the drugs.
Clinical trials have shown that DDI and DDC, like AZT, can prolong the life
of Aids patients whose immune defences are already collapsing. But there is
no evidence that they would be any better than AZT in staving off symptoms
in those who are in the early stages of infec-tion.
In the US, four smaller trials of AZT in early HIV infection have given more
encouraging results. Like Concorde, they compared groups of people who had
been allocated at random to take either AZT or a placebo (inactive pills).
All four trials showed that the drug delayed the onset of Aids and three
were stopped early on ethical grounds - with patients followed up for no
more than a year on average - so that those on placebo could receive the
supposed benefits of AZT.
When the US results came in, the Anglo-French committee co-ordinating
Concorde decided to stick to their planned three-year trial. They did,
however, change the procedure so that patients with persistently low levels
of CD4 immune cells - normally a sign that symptoms are about to develop -
could opt to take AZT. CD4 cells are white blood cells which play a key role
in the immune system.
Wellcome said yesterday that, by changing the design in this way and
allowing patients to move from placebo to AZT, the researchers 'diluted' the
difference between the two groups. But Professor Ian Waller, Concorde's
principal UK investigator, denied that the trial's impact had been reduced
significantly.
'This is much the most powerful study ever carried out with asymptomatic
patients,' he said. In terms of the number patient-years studied, Concorde
was larger than the four US trials put together.
After Concorde, Prof Waller and his colleagues see little future in treating
people with HIV with a single drug.
They hope that combinations of three or more drugs - which might include
AZT, DDI or DDC with others still being developed - will prove to be more
successful at stopping HIV. But that prospect lies several years in the
future.
