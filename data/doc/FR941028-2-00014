NIST Docket No. 90031




Title: 

Detecting Polymer Solidification During Injection Molding.


Description: 

New NIST technology makes it possible to determine the optimum time for opening a mold during an injection molding
process. The invention indicates the solidification of a polymer through changes in the fluorescence radiation
from a dye which has been doped into the polymer.


NIST Docket No. 92058






Title: 

Perflourinated Ionomer Membrane Invention.


















Description: 

This NIST invention describes a perflourinated ionomer membrane having improved transport characteristics. A
surfactant species is added to a polymer mixture prior to film casting. The resulting membranes have a measurably
altered membrane microstructure and improved transport characteristics over prior art membranes. This NIST invention
describes the method of producing the improved membranes. The membranes of this NIST invention are useful in a number
of separation processes, including the separation of NH

 from gaseous and liquid mixtures, in the production of NaOH and Cl

 gas from the electrolytic dissolution of NaCl, in the separation of toxic and radioactive metals from aqueous streams,
and in solid polymer electrolyte H

 fuel cells.





NIST Docket No. 94028







Title: 

Cable Arrangement and Platform for Stabilized Load Lifting.





Description: 

NIST researchers have designed a cable arrangement and platform that completely stabilizes a load during lifting.
The invention is attachable to both boom and tower cranes, and is useful for tasks such as loading cargo onto ships and
moving materials at construction sites.
