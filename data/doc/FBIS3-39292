<F P=106> [Report by Tapio Vilkama: "Russia Is Number One in Trade </F>
With the East"] 
  [Text] Eastern trade today comprises trade with the 
countries of the former Soviet and Yugoslav blocks plus East 
Europe, including Albania: a total of 27 countries from the 
former socialist economic system. Last year, Finland's eastern 
trade reached a value of about 22 billion Finnish markkas [FMk], 
approximately 10 percent of the country's total foreign trade. 
Our eastern trade developed very favorably last year, with 
significant growth in several countries. 
  Russia represents about 60 percent of Finland's total 
eastern 
trade and 80 percent of trade with the CIS and the Baltic 
states. Russia's share of Finland's total foreign trade was, 
according to statistics for the period from January through 
November 1993, just under 6 percent. Russia is Finland's 
fifth-largest trading partner. 
  Trade with Russia, which shows a FMk2 billion deficit for 
Finland, increased by 43 percent over the previous year. The 
growth in Finland's total exports is partly due to the rapid 
expansion of food exports and the fact that re-exports via 
Finland have almost tripled. These two factors may account for 
one-fifth of our total exports to Russia. 
  Trading between Finland and Russia is based on a new MFN 
agreement based on GATT principles. 
  Economic cooperation between the countries, in addition to 
the trade agreement, includes a separate development program for 
the neighboring regions. It is within this framework that the 
authorities of the provinces of Lapland, Oulu, Mikkeli, North 
Karelia, and Kymi on the Finnish side and the Murmansk region, 
the Karelian Republic, the city of St. Petersburg, and the 
Leningrad region on the Russian side are trying to set up a 
basis for direct contacts between enterprises. 
<H5>  Capricious Regulations Interfere With Trade </H5>
  A stop was put to duty-free trading between Finland and 
Russia by a Russian decision in early December 1992. At that 
date, basic duty averaging 15 percent was imposed on Finnish 
exports. Last year, Russia raised the general duty percentage 
to between 20 and 50 percent. Finland, for its part, started 
levying general duty on imports from Russia as of 15 February 
1993. 
  Import duties have, however, not been a key factor in trade 
between Finland and Russia. Instead, problems are created by 
several other legal charges imposed by Russia, e.g., value-added 
tax and excise duties (especially on luxury goods), a number of 
compulsory, complicated, and excessively expensive certificates 
regarding safety, hygiene, radioactivity, and food products, in 
addition to continuously changing customs procedures. 
  Finnish capital has already been invested in some 500 joint 
ventures in Russia, most of them in regions near our border (the 
Leningrad region, St. Petersburg, Karelia, and Murmansk) and in 
the Moscow region. 
<H5>  The Commission Still Lacks a Head </H5>
  The Russian section of the Finnish-Russian Economic 
Commission has now been without a chairman for almost six 
months. We hope that a new Russian chairman can be appointed 
soon. Minister Seppo Kaariainen, the Finnish chairman, is 
planning a visit directly after the reorganization of the 
Russian Government in mid-January. An official visit to Finland 
by Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has also been in the 
offing for some time. 
  Russia's debt to Finland is FMk8 billion. The Russian 
Government has promised to study repayment arrangements through 
the sale of property and real estate assets in Russia or 
long-term deliveries of raw material. There is also a 
preliminary agreement on arrangements that would allow Russia to 
repay half a billion of its debt in the context of additional 
Finnish purchases of weapons. Private companies have also 
hundreds of millions of markkas worth of claims without 
securities. 
<H5>  Estonia Before Other Baltic States </H5>
  Trade between Finland and the Baltic states developed very 
favorably last year. Baltic trade, however, represents only 
about 1 percent of Finland's total foreign trade and 12 percent 
of our eastern trade. 
  Estonia is clearly the most important of the Baltic states 
and one of Finland's 16 most important export countries. 
Figures for trade with Estonia are greater than that for any 
East European country except Poland. Our trade with Estonia 
reached FMk2.3 billion during the period from January through 
November 1993. The trade surplus is FMk944 million in Finland's 
favor. Our trade with Estonia showed a clear growth last year. 
  Trade with Latvia and Lithuania remains on a modest scale, 
and there are only a few dozen joint ventures based on Finnish 
capital in these countries. 
  During the period from January through November 1993, trade 
with Latvia was worth FMk347 million while trade with Lithuania 
was worth FMk241 million, which places these countries in the 
same category as other former Soviet bloc countries. Latvia and 
Lithuania, with Ukraine between them, are next in order after 
Russia and Estonia. Our trade with Latvia and Lithuania grew 
somewhat more slowly than with Estonia, and imports from these 
countries increased faster than exports. 
<H5>  Advantages With KEVSOS Begin To Diminish </H5>
  East European countries represent about 25 percent of 
Finland's total eastern trade. Trade with Central East Europe, 
except for Romania, developed favorably last year. Most 
significant has been our trade with Poland, which ranks as 
Finland's 12th-largest export country. Trade with Poland rose 
to FMk3.1 billion during the period from January through 
November 1993, a growth of 20 percent over the previous year. 
  Trade with Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia showed 
a 
growth rate of a few dozen percent last year. Our total trade 
with Hungary during the period from January through November 
1993 was worth less than FMk1 billion. Trade with the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia was worth around FMk0.5 billion. Trade 
with Bulgaria and Romania, on the other hand, has remained 
minimal. 
  In the early 1970's Finland joined the so-called KEVSOS 
[expansion unknown] free trade agreements with Bulgaria, Poland, 
Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. The EFTA [European Free Trade 
Association] countries have now negotiated new free trade 
agreements with these countries and Romania. Finland's customs 
benefits under KEVSOS are due to be gradually phased out by 
2001, when the entire KEVSOS agreement will be replaced by an 
EFTA agreement.

  The table shows Finland's 1993 trade figures for the target 
countries in millions of markkas and their evolution from 1992 
to 1993. Although misleading, the high percentages indicate the 
growth activities last year.
