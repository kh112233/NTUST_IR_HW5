FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Microsoft and Stac settle
dispute
Microsoft, the world's largest personal computer software company, is taking
an equity stake in Stac Electronics, a small Californian software house. The
purchase is part of an agreement designed to put an end to a conflict
between the two companies which had become deeply embarrassing for
Microsoft.
In February, a jury decided that a key Microsoft software product infringed
two Stac patents and ordered the company to pay Dollars 120m in damages.
The patents concern a technique for compressing computer data, so that
double the amount of information can be stored on a computer's hard disk.
This month, a US federal judge ordered Microsoft to recall versions of the
offending software - its flagship operating system MS-Dos - of which close
to 100m copies have been sold.
Under yesterday's agreement, Microsoft and Stac will cross-license all their
existing disk compression patents, as well as any other compression patents
either of them receives over the next five years.
The agreement calls for Microsoft to pay Stac royalties of Dollars 1m a
month over 43 months.
It will also buy Dollars 39.9m of 4 per cent non-voting convertible
preferred stock maturing in 2004. Converted into common stock, Microsoft
would own 15 per cent of Stac.
Mr Gary Clow, Stac chairman, said the agreement put an end to legal fees,
created a royalty stream, put money in the bank and ushered in a new era of
co-operation between the companies.
Microsoft will no longer have to pay Stac the Dollars 120m awarded in
February, while Stac will not have to pay Microsoft Dollars 13.8m awarded
for misappropriation of trade secrets.
Both companies pointed out yesterday that they believed the deal was in the
best interests of their customers and shareholders.
Dealers, personal computer manufacturers and customers would be able to
continue to use Microsoft products containing Stac technology without fear
of legal repercussions.
