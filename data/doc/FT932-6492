FT  28 MAY 93 / De Klerk seeks foreign support
President FW de Klerk appealed yesterday for international support to
develop the South African economy and offered in return to help tackle the
problems of Africa, Reuter reports from Cape Town.
Mr de Klerk said South Africa needed full access to World Bank and
International Monetary Fund facilities, fair access to international finance
and world markets and increased foreign investment to lift its economy out
of recession.
After a speech to members of the World Economic Forum, Mr de Klerk said
South Africa was offering its partnership in finding solutions to Africa's
problems. Some 130 business executives from the US, Europe, Australia and
Africa are attending the forum.
