MEASURE M'S IMPACT ON COUNTY'S TRAFFIC, TAXES 
Sharen Heath opposes Measure M (Oct. 22) because it uses a sales tax to raise 
revenue instead of a gas tax. 
I agree that we should be paying for streets, roads and highways with an 
increase in the gas tax. But does she realize that it would take about a 
50-cent increase, (up from the present 9 cents per gallon), to raise the same 
amount of money as a half-cent sales tax increase? I think anyone would 
recognize that a 50-cent increase in the gas tax for Orange County alone would 
place an intolerable burden on our retailers of gasoline. 
I am a strong advocate of an increased gas tax at the state level. This does 
not mean that Orange County can fail to pay its fair share. We are surrounded 
by counties that have already enacted a half-cent sales tax for transportation. 
We will be unable to compete for state and federal matching funds if we defeat 
Measure M. 
California was once a leader in transportation in the nation. We are now ranked 
50th, the bottom, in per capita spending for transportation. Orange County 
ranks 43rd out of 58 counties in the state in per capita spending. It is time 
to stop blaming others, assume responsibility and pay for what we get. So far 
we have paid for congestion and a disintegrating infrastructure.
