  [Text] Tehran, June 12, IRNA -- The terrorist Mojahedin 
Khalq Organization (MKO) is collaborating with international 
drug traffickers, an MKO member arrested recently, has disclosed. 
  The member, Motalleb Mahdavi, said MKO had to collaborate 
with international drug gangs after the Iraq-Iran war due to 
what the MKO ringleaders justified as "financial problems." 
  Mahdavi admitted that he himself was responsible for finding 
secure routes for the drug traffickers coming from Pakistan into 
Iran. 
  After the traffickers had entered Iran, they passed through 
the central `loot' desert and through Kerman and Isfahan 
Provinces, where the drugs were hidden in buses and tankers in 
order to be carried to Turkey and Europe via the city of 
Orumiyeh in west Azerbaijan Province, he added.
