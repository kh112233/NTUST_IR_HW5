NATION IN BRIEF; 
WASHINGTON, D.C.; 
SMITHSONIAN TO CUT STAFF, PROGRAMS 
Facing deep budget cuts, the Smithsonian Institution will impose layoffs, 
abolish some existing programs and cancel planned expansion, Smithsonian 
Secretary Robert McC. 
Adams said. Adams said he expects the creation of the American Indian museum to 
proceed, but virtually everything else is in question. Some of the endangered 
projects are a $300-million annex to the National Air and Space Museum at 
Dulles Airport, expansion of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and the 
addition of "badly needed" storage space at the Museum Support Center in 
Suitland, Md.
