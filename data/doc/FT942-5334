FT  04 JUN 94 / Zaire suspended by IMF
The International Monetary Fund yesterday stopped just short of expelling
Zaire for failing to pay its debts, Reuter reports from Washington. It
suspended Zaire's membership and called on it to eliminate debt arrears.
Zaire began to fall behind on debt payments to the IMF in November 1990 and
owes the Fund some Dollars 315m. It is the second country to have IMF
membership suspended, after Sudan last year.
