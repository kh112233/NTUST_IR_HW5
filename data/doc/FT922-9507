FT  07 MAY 92 / World Trade News: ABB-led consortium to build Iran plant
IRAN has awarded a consortium led by Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the
Zurich-based engineering group, a Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 700m) contract to
build a 2,000MW hydroelectric plant on the Karun River.
ABB said its German subsidiary, ABB Mannheim, would supply eight generators
and all the electrical equipment for the project, giving it a Dollars 340m
share of the Karun-3 contract overall. The hydroelectric plant, in
south-west Iran, will be one of the world's largest and follows ABB's
energetic pursuit of work in the Gulf.
Gebruder Sulzer of Switzerland will supply turbines, valves and other
equipment worth Dollars 230m, while Austria's Voest Alpine will provide
hydromechanical equipment worth Dollars 145m. Brazil's Andrade Gutierrez
will undertake work worth Dollars 530m on constructing the dam and other
civil engineering.
Financing for the project, which is due to have the first 500MW on stream
before 1997, is still being negotiated, ABB said. The project is one of
several power plants planned by the Iranian government on both the Karun and
Arras Rivers, including a further, Karun-4, hydroelectric plant.
