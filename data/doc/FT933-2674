FT  17 SEP 93 / Observer: Austerity driver
Not content with ordering a public sector pay-freeze at home, Kenneth Clarke
is preparing to take the gospel of austerity across the Atlantic.
During his first attendance at the annual meetings of the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank at the end of this month, Britain's chancellor
will press for new action to increase efficiency and cut operating costs at
the two organisations.
Staff salaries and allowances will be high in Clarke's line of fire. Britain
is still smarting at having failed to block a 6 per cent increase in wage
bills for pampered officials at the two Washington organisations earlier
this year.
The British Treasury feels that it has already made some progress because
World Bank president Lewis Preston has promised that next year's bank budget
will be based on the assumption of zero real growth in operating costs.
But there are compelling arguments for putting still more pressure on the
bank and IMF.
Better cost control at the IMF and World Bank would assist the freeing of
resources, in turn helping poorer developing nations at a time when national
aid budgets are being squeezed.
And because Norman Lamont also took a tough line with the Washington
bureaucrats, Clarke would, for once, be doing something to meet the approval
of his waspish predecessor.
