FT  27 NOV 93 / Doubts cast on Matrix trial
A senior civil servant yesterday cast doubt on the basis of the
Matrix-Churchill trial concerning exports of arms to Iraq, which led to the
establishment of the Scott inquiry. He admitted that the case, which
collapsed in November 1992, could have been 'blown out of the water' before
it went ahead.
The admission emerged as the Scott inquiry began to focus upon one of the
prime arguments used by Customs and Excise to mount their prosecution
against three executives of Matrix-Churchill, the Midlands machine tool
manufacturer.
The Old Bailey prosecution hinged on a contention by Customs and Excise,
based on documents and specifications obtained at the factory, that the
machines were dedicated to military manufacturing.
Lord Justice Scott suggested during the inquiry that both military and
industrial lists used by the Department of Trade and Industry to draw
distinctions between uses when considering export applications could have
covered machines that had such special design features. Because there was no
requirement to state the specific end use of the machines on the export
licence application, the distinction between military and industrial use
could not readily be drawn.
Mr Eric Beston, head of the DTI's export control branch from 1985 to 1990,
said in evidence: 'That is something I have never thought about. That could
perfectly well have blown the Customs case out of the water.' He added: 'I
wish I had thought about that at the time.'
Earlier Mr Beston told the hearing that he believed the argument that the
tools were specially designed was based on a narrow technical approach which
he had not experienced previously. While he admitted he was familiar with
the 'special design' concept, he said he believedand 'no doubt made aware'
to Customs that they had taken 'a rather technical approach to the framing
of the action'.
