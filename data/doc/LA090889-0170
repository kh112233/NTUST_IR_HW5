GIOIOSA LINKS ROSE TO SECOND PIK SIX WINNER 
Thomas Gioiosa today implicated Pete Rose in another race track gambling scheme 
during his drug and tax-evasion trial, giving federal prosecutors more evidence 
in their investigation of the former Cincinnati Reds manager. 
Under cross-examination, Gioiosa said that he had cashed a second Pik Six 
ticket for Rose and claimed all the winnings on his taxes. Rose now has been 
linked to two Pik Six payoffs during Gioiosa's trial. 
Rose is under investigation by a federal grand jury in Cincinnati looking into 
whether he hid income from gambling, memorabilia sales and autograph 
appearances. 
Gioiosa, who lived with Rose from 1979 to 1984, had refused to discuss his 
gambling associations with Rose before his trial in U.S. District Court. 
However, he told to a 12-member jury today that he cashed a winning $6,351 Pik 
Six ticket from Turfway Park in northern Kentucky for Rose in December, 1986. 
Gioiosa later reported the full amount on his taxes, even though he said he 
gave the money to Rose and got back only a part of the winnings. 
A Pik Six pays off when a bettor correctly chooses the winner of six 
consecutive races. 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Kathleen Brinkman asked Gioiosa who won the $6,356 Pik 
Six. 
"I was with Pete Rose. I went down and cashed it and gave him the money," 
Gioiosa said. 
He said Rose then gave him a share of the winnings, but he wasn't sure how 
much. 
"I didn't count it," Gioiosa said. 
When asked who bought the ticket, Gioiosa said, "I don't remember." 
Gioiosa, 31, of New Bedford, Mass., is on trial on charges of conspiracy to 
distribute cocaine and tax evasion. Gioiosa could be sentenced to up to 38 
years in jail and fined $2 million if found guilty on all counts. 
One of the tax evasion charges involves another Pik Six ticket from Turfway 
Park -- this one a $47,646 payoff that Gioiosa claimed on his taxes but the 
government contends actually belonged to Rose.
