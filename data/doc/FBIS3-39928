Germany"] 
  [Excerpt] Bonn -- Scientists hold disputing views on 
whether "Islamic fundamentalism" is the correct term, or whether 
one should rather speak of "Islamism." There is some dispute 
among politicians on how dangerous the new religious fanaticism 
is. What is undisputed, however, is that militant Muslims 
around the Mediterranean are reaching for power. It is also 
undisputed that through the war in Bosnia, where most of the 
victims are Muslims, Islamic fundamentalism has reached Europe 
-- and that Germany and France, as the countries with the 
highest Islamic populations in West Europe, are directly 
affected. 
  Bonn government circles and European intelligence services 
agree that a victory of fundamentalists in Algeria and Egypt, or 
even Tunisia and Morocco, would disturb the security balance in 
Europe. 
  Intelligence experts consider Germany to be a "place of 
rest" 
for many fanatical Islamic organizations that are also prepared 
to use terror in Germany. Cambridge orientalist Ahmad 'Akbar 
says that every one of the 14 million Muslims in Europe "can 
turn into a radical activist under certain circumstances."
