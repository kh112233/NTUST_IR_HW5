  [Text] Freetown, 11 May (AFP) -- An attack launched on 9 
May by Sierra Leonean rebels of the Revolutionary United Front 
[RUF] against the Bandajuma village (200 km southwest of 
Freetown), left 55 dead among the civilian population. The 
report was made by survivors who witnessed the events in a 
telephone conversation from Bo (40 km north of Bandajuma) where 
they took refuge. 
  This attack brings to 142 the number of people killed (67 
rebels, 65 civilians, and 10 soldiers) since the beginning of 
the month during military operations attributed to the RUF or to 
clashes between the front and the Army. 
  A military spokesman questioned by AFP in Freetown confirmed 
the attack against Bandajuma and said the assailants fled from 
the village "after nine hours of fighting," by Guinean troops 
who are helping government forces fight the rebels. 
  "This attack is the most violent one ever launched during 
the 
last months and we were very surprised by the force of the fire 
of arms still in possession of the rebels," the spokesman said.
