 Department of Veterans Affairs.

<ACTION>
ACTION:

 Final rule.




</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive service
connection for certain diseases even though there is no record of the disease during service. This amendment is necessary
to implement a decision of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the authority granted by the Agent Orange Act of
1991 that there is an association between exposure to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). The intended effect of
this amendment is to establish presumptive service connection for those conditions based on herbicide exposure.



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
EFFECTIVE DATE:

 This amendment is effective February 3, 1994, as provided by Public Law 1024.

<SUPPLEM>
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.307(a), 3.309(e), and 3.311a to establish presumptive service connection
for Hodgkin's disease and PCT based on exposure to herbicides in the 

Federal Register

 of September 28, 1993 (58 FR 5052830). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments, suggestions
or objections concerning the proposal on or before October 28, 1993. Since no comments were received, the proposed
amendments are adopted without change.



The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.




The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 64.109 and 64.110.
