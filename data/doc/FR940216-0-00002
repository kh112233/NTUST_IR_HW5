 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:


I. Introduction


In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 11, 1992 (57 FR 35833), FDA announced that a color additive petition (CAP 6C0203) had been filed by CTFA, 1101
17th St. NW., suite 300, Washington, DC 20036, proposing that the color additive regulations for FDC Red No.
40 be amended to provide for the safe use of FDC Red No. 40 and its lakes for coloring drugs and cosmetics intended
for use in the area of the eye. The petition was filed under section 721 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21
U.S.C. 379e). CTFA later amended the petition to limit the lakes requested for eye area use to the FDC Aluminum
Lake prepared in accordance with 82.51 (21 CFR 82.51).


II. Definitions


Section 70.3(s) (21 CFR 70.3(s)) defines the term ``area of the eye'' as ``the area enclosed within the circumference
of the supra-orbital ridge and the infra-orbital ridge, including the eyebrow, the skin below the eyebrow, the eyelids
and the eyelashes, and conjunctival sac of the eye, the eyeball, and the soft areolar tissue that lies within the perimeter
of the infra-orbital ridge.''
The term ``lake'' is defined in 70.3(l) as ``a straight color extended on a substratum by adsorption, coprecipitation,
or chemical combination that does not include any combination of ingredients made by simple mixing process.''


III. Background


Section 70.5(a) (21 CFR 70.5(a)) states that ``No listing or certification of a color additive shall be considered
to authorize the use of any such color additive in any article intended for use in the area of the eye unless such listing
or certification of such color additive specifically provides for such use.'' The petitioner has requested that
FDC Red No. 40 and FDC Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake be listed for use in the area of the eye.
Part 82 (21 CFR part 82) lists the certifiable provisionally listed colors and specifications, and includes a description
of and specifications for the lakes that are permitted for use in foods (82.51) and in drugs and cosmetics (82.1051).
Sections 82.51 and 82.1051 list the acceptable lakes that can be combined with the straight colors listed therein.
The petitioner has requested that this order be limited to the Aluminum Lake of FDC Red No. 40, prepared in accordance
with 82.51. Section 82.51 also limits to alumina the substrata that can be used for FDC lakes.


IV. Safety


In its evaluation of the safety of the proposed use of the subject color additive, FDA has considered the safety data
submitted to support current listings for the use of FDC Red No. 40 in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. FDA has also
evaluated ocular toxicity studies submitted to support eye area use of the color additive and its aluminum lake. The
agency has determined that the petitioned use is safe because no adverse effects were found in these studies at levels
relevant to the petitioned use.


V. Conclusions


Based on data contained in the petition and other relevant information, FDA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty
that no harm will result from the use of FDC Red No. 40 and FDC Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake as color additives in
the area of the eye, and that the additives are safe for their intended use. The agency also concludes on the basis of
available data that the color additive will perform its intended effect and thus is suitable for the petitioned uses.
The agency, therefore, is amending the color additive regulations in 74.1340(b) and 74.2340(b) (21
CFR 74.1340(b) and 74.2340(b)) to provide for the use of FDC Red No. 40 and FDC Red No. 40 Aluminum Lake in
drugs and cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye. 
This document provides for the permanent listing of the aluminum lake of FDC Red No. 40 for use in the area of the
eye. Other uses of the lakes of FDC Red No. 40 are already permanently listed under 74.1340 and 74.2340.
The agency notes that 74.1340(a)(3) and 74.2340(a)(2) refer to 82.51 and 82.1051 for
the manufacturing process and specifications for the lakes of FDC Red No. 40. While the agency recognizes that
this referral is to a section that is designated as provisional, FDA considers this referral to be appropriate because
that section defines current good manufacturing practice and provides appropriate specifications to ensure the
quality and purity of lakes made with the color additive. The agency has under consideration an action to permanently
list all lakes that have been provisionally listed under parts 81 and 82. When that action is completed, FDA intends
to amend this referral as appropriate.


VI. Inspection of Documents


In accordance with 71.15 (21 CFR 71.15), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon
in reaching its decision to list the petitioned uses are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition (address above) by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided
in 71.15, the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure
before making the documents available for inspection.


VII. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.


VIII. Objections


Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 18, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will publish
notice of the objections that the agency has received or lack thereof in the 

Federal Register
