SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:




I. Introduction


In a notice published in the 

Federal Register

 of August 11, 1992 (57 FR 35833), FDA announced that a color additive petition (CAP 6C0206) had been filed by CTFA, 1101
17th St. NW., suite 300, Washington, DC 20036. The petition proposed that the color additive regulations for FDC
Blue No. 1 be amended to provide for the safe use of FDC Blue No. 1 and its lakes for coloring drugs and cosmetics
intended for use in the area of the eye. The petition was filed under section 721 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (21 U.S.C. 379e). CTFA later amended the petition to limit the lakes requested for eye area use to FDC Blue
No. 1 Aluminum Lake prepared in accordance with 82.51 (21 CFR 82.51).


II. Definitions


Section 70.3(s) (21 CFR 70.3(s)) defines the term ``area of the eye'' as ``the area enclosed within the circumference
of the supra-orbital ridge and the infra-orbital ridge, including the eyebrow, the skin below the eyebrow, the eyelids
and the eyelashes, and conjunctival sac of the eye, the eyeball, and the soft areolar tissue that lies within the perimeter
of the infra-orbital ridge.'' The term ``lake'' is defined in 70.3(l) as ``straight color extended on a substratum
by adsorption, coprecipitation, or chemical combination that does not include any combination of ingredients made
by simple mixing process.''


III. Background


Section 70.5(a) (21 CFR 70.5(a)) states that ``No listing or certification of a color additive shall be considered
to authorize the use of any such color additive in any article intended for use in the area of the eye unless such listing
or certification of such color additive specifically provides for such use.'' The regulations, in 81.1 (21
CFR 81.1), state that the color additive lakes listed therein may not be used in products that are intended to be used
in the area of the eye. The petitioner has requested that the uses for FDC Blue No. 1 and FDC Blue No. 1 Aluminum
Lake be expanded to include uses in the area of the eye.
Part 82 (21 CFR part 82) lists the certified provisionally listed colors and specifications and includes a description
of, and specifications for, the lakes that are permitted for use in foods (82.51) and in drugs and cosmetics
(82.1051). Sections 82.51 and 82.1051 list the acceptable lakes that can be combined with the straight colors
listed therein. The petitioner has requested that this order be limited to the Aluminum Lake of FDC Blue No. 1,
prepared in accordance with 82.51. Section 82.51 also limits the substrata that can be used for FDC lakes
to alumina.


IV. Safety


In its evaluation of the safety of the proposed use of the subject color additive, FDA has considered the safety data
submitted previously to support current listings for the use of FDC Blue No. 1 in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.
FDA also evaluated ocular toxicity studies submitted to support eye area use of the color additive and its aluminum
lake. FDA has determined that the petitioned use is safe, because no adverse effects were found in these studies at
levels relevant to the petitioned use.


V. Conclusions


Based on data contained in the petition and other relevant material, FDA concludes that there is a reasonable certainty
that no harm will result from the use of FDC Blue No. 1 and FDC Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake as color additives in
the area of the eye, and that the additives are safe for their intended use. The agency also concludes on the basis of
available data that the color additive will perform its intended effect and thus is suitable for the petitioned uses.
The agency, therefore, is amending the color additive regulations in 74.1101(c) and 74.2101(c) (21
CFR 74.1101(c) and 74.2101(c)) to provide for the use of FDC Blue No. 1 and FDC Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake in
drugs and cosmetics, respectively, intended for use in the area of the eye. This document provides for the permanent
listing of the aluminum lake of FDC Blue No. 1 for use in the area of the eye. Other uses of the lakes of FDC Blue
No. 1 are provisionally listed under 81.1, 82.51, 82.101, and 82.1051. The agency notes that 74.1101(b)(2)
and 74.2101(b)(2) refer to 82.51 and 82.1051 for the manufacturing process and specifications for
the lakes of FDC Blue No. 1. While the agency recognizes that this referral is to a section that is designated as
provisional, FDA considers this referral to be appropriate because that section defines current good manufacturing
practice and provides appropriate specifications to ensure the quality and purity of lakes made with the color additive.
The agency has under consideration an action to permanently list all lakes that have been provisionally listed under
parts 81 and 82. When that action is completed, FDA intends to amend this referral as appropriate.


VI. Inspection of Documents


In accordance with 71.15 (21 CFR 71.15), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon
in reaching its decision to list the petitioned uses are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition (address above) by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided
in 71.15, the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure
before making the documents available for inspection.


VII. Environmental Impact


The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.


VIII. Objections


Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 18, 1994, file with the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will publish
notice of the objections that the agency has received or lack thereof in the 

Federal Register
