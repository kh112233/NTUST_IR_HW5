 

IV. Environmental Impact 


The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24 (a)(8) and (a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually
or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment
nor an environmental impact statement is required. 
The proposed actions pertaining to food labeling meet the criteria in 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) for exclusion from preparation
of an environmental assessment and an environmental impact statement. The proposed regulations pertaining to the
small business notification procedure meet the criteria for exclusion described in 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8). 


V. Paperwork Reduction Act 


This proposed rule contains information collections that are subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Therefore, in accordance with 5 CFR part 1320, the
title, description, and respondent description of the information requirements are shown below with an estimate
of the annual collection and information burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering necessary information, and completion and submission of the request.



Title: 

Food Labeling; Nutrition Labeling, Small Business Exemption. 


Description: 

The proposed rule provides the procedures for the submission of a notice of a claim by a company of an exemption from
FDA's regulations for mandatory nutrition labeling. FDA action on the notice will be limited to review for completeness
and acknowledgement that the notice had been received and was or was not adequate. 
The 1993 amendments revise the basis for a small business exemption provided by section 403(q)(5) of the act. This
new provision, section 403(q)(5)(E) of the act, provides an exemption for a food product based on the number of employees
of the company and the number of units sold on an annual basis. Under the 1993 amendments, to qualify for an exemption,
a person must file the notice mentioned in the preceding paragraph with FDA before the time period for the claimed exemption.
Proposed 101.9(j)(18)(iv) and 101.36(f)(2)(iv) reflect the information identified in section 403(q)(5)(E)
of the act as necessary as part of the notice for a claimed small business exemption. 


Description of Respondents: 

Persons and businesses, particularly small businesses.

The agency expects that the number of respondents and corresponding annual burden hours will decrease over succeeding
years as the basis for additional exemptions changes. By May 1997, FDA estimates that approximately 3,200 companies
may be filing notices to claim the exemption with a corresponding annual burden hours of approximately 25,600 hours.

The agency has submitted copies of the proposed rule to OMB for its review of these recordkeeping requirements. Interested
persons are requested to send comments regarding this estimated burden, including suggestions for reducing this
burden to FDA's Dockets Management Branch (address above), and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,
OMB, rm. 3208, New Executive Bldg., Washington, DC 20503, ATTN: Desk Officer for FDA.
