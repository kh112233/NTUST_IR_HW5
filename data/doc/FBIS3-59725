<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  In order to check the destruction of our global environment 
by a large amount of CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  emissions caused by mass 
consumption of fossil fuels and to revitalize the earth's 
environment, various measures are being proposed at present. Of 
these the most effective, in our opinion, will be a large-scale 
introduction of clean energy and development of an innovative 
energy conversion technology. Faced with the environmental 
crisis situation, we feel that development of a revolutionary 
technology designed to convert clean and inexhaustible solar 
light into energy will be extremely important. 
  Based on our judgment that hydrogen will become one of the 
main energy sources of the future, we have undertaken a project 
designed to construct a hydrogen manufacturing system utilizing 
a high-temperature vapor electrolytic technology combined with 
the use of solar radiation as a primary energy source. The 
conceptual diagram of this system is shown in Fig. 1. 


<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-003LC-38A>             Fig. 1. The Conceptual Design of Hydrogen Manufacturing </FIG>




  One of the characteristics of this system is that, since it 
converts solar energy at 1000&deg;C, unlike the type of 
conversion occurring in a mid-temperature zone, we can expect 
high thermodynamic conversion efficiency. This system collects 
solar light in a solar collector, thereby generating high 
temperature of approximately 1000&deg;C. High-temperature 
electrolytic cells are heated by means of oxide solid 
electrolyte. This electrolytic system is intended to obtain 
direct current necessary for electrolysis through direct 
conversion of heat into electricity by using exhaust heat of 
approximately 700&deg;C produced during the latter stage of the 
electrolytic unit operation. In order to construct this system, 
it will be necessary to develop a component technologies such as 
solar concentrator, solar heat receiver, high-temperature 
electrolytic cell, and thermoelectric converter. 
  In this report, we will describe our experimental research 
in 
a thermoelectric power generator into which an FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
thermoelectric element (which uses as its heat source a 
high-temperature heat obtained from a large-scale solar 
concentrator) is incorporated. The concentrator is installed at 
Tohoku University. 
  2. Solar Light Concentrator and Solar Heat 
Receiver 
  A large-scale solar light concentrator which uses a rotating 
parabolic mirror with an aperture measuring 10 meters and focal 
distance of 3.2 meters is installed at Tohoku University. Energy 
input capacity of this concentrator is 50kW, and when a disc 
sample is placed on a focal plane, the degree of conversion 
becomes 50,000 times as great, making it possible for us to 
obtain super high temperature reaching as high as 4000K. 
  The temperature required for a hot vapor electrolysis is no 
more than 1000&deg;C, and, since an extremely high concentration 
of solar light is not required for this purpose, the solar heat 
receiver is designed to gather sunlight while defocusing on a 
8-cm diameter ceramic tube surface so as to obtain an adequately 
high temperature required for high-temperature electrolysis. The 
computational result of sunlight concentration distribution over 
the tube surface was reported at a research forum held last 
year, revealing that it was possible to obtain the maximum 
concentration level of 6000. This computed value is in good 
agreement with the distribution of solar radiation gathered on 
the tube surface obtained by actual measurement using a 
heat-flux meter.

   In order to obtain high-temperature heat efficiently from 
concentrated sunlight, we have developed a solar receiver made 
of porous ceramics shown in Fig. 2. Our experiment in high 
temperature heat generation by the combined use of the solar 
receiver and a large-scale solar concentrator installed at 
Tohoku University already has been reported&lt;sup&gt; 1)&lt;/sup&gt; . 
Generation of heat stabilized at 1000&deg;C in the part, into 
which electrolytic cell is fitted, and at 800&deg;C in the part, 
into which thermoelectric power generation elements are 
assembled at a latter stage of heat generation, have been 
verified. 
<H5>  3. Development of FeSi </H5>
&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  Thermoelectric Power 
Generator Using Sunlight as Heat Source 
  As described in the previous section, it has become possible 
to obtain high heat of 800&deg;C stabilized at the latter stage 
of electrolytic cell unit operation with the use of the 
prototype solar receiver. We have, therefore, conducted R&amp;D 
of a 
system designed to generate power used in electrolysis through 
the direct conversion of heat into electricity utilizing 
thermoelectric elements which utilizes the high temperature of 
800&deg;C. 
  The performance of thermoelectric materials is evaluated by 
the performance index given by 

  &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  (&agr;, &kgr;, and &rgr; represent thermoelectric power, 
thermal 
conductivity, and electrical resistivity) SiGe and 
FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  are known as high-temperature-type power 
generating elements. Although the performance index of the 
FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  thermal power generating element is considered 
low, Matsubara and his team at Yamaguchi University reported 
recently that, by treating the FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  element in the 
oxygen plasma, they were able to produce a 
high-performance-index&lt;inf&gt; 2)&lt;/inf&gt;  FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt; 
thermoelectric power generating element. As a result, this 
element is now attracting attention as a promising 
high-temperature power generating element material. Moreover, 
since a large number of power-generating elements are required 
in heat-electric direct conversion, element material cost must 
be low. From the standpoint of material cost, also, the use of 
the FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  thermoelectric power generating element 
will be welcome. For these reasons, in this research, we used 
the FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  element in our power generation experiment. 
  Photo 1 shows FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  thermoelectric power 
generating elements K and I. These are produced by different 
companies.

  Current-voltage and output characteristics of these single 
elements are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The reason why the output 
of I element is lower than that of K element is that its 
sectional area is smaller than that of K element, resulting in 
an increase in internal resistance. When the conversion, 
designed to make a sectional area of both elements to be in the 
same size, is performed, both outputs were approximately on the 
same level. Using these elements, as shown in Photo 2, we made 
an FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  thermoelectric power generator, designed to 
convert solar energy into a primary energy, and attached it to a 
lower part of the solar receiver. This generator consists of the 
first, second, and third blocks. Eight elements are attached 
around a stainless steel tube of each block measuring 6 cm in 
diameter and 2mm in thickness. The power generating element's 
cold junction part is fixed on a water-cooled copper plate. 
Photo 3 shows the way in which the interior of the power 
generator is viewed from the lower part. The power generation 
element's p-n junction is extruding in the central part touching 
a hot gas. It is clear that a space between the junction and the 
stainless steel tube is insulated by a heat-resistant blanket. 
In the first block, five layers of I elements, in the second 
block, six layers of I elements, and in the third block, four 
layers of K element, a total of 120 elements are attached. 
  We conducted a thermoelectric power generation experiment 
with sunlight focused on the solar receiver. In this experiment, 
we installed a thermocouple device in the center of the 
stainless steel tube and measured each layer's gas temperature. 
Fig. 5 plots shifting gas temperatures and power generating 
element's cold junction temperatures by time, indicating clearly 
the stabilized temperatures. The lower part of the first block 
has the highest temperature, and as we move upward, we see 
temperature gradually falling, which makes us think that a 
further study on insulation of the stainless steel tube side may 
be necessary. 
  We conducted power generation experiment by connecting 
blocks 
in series to measure current-voltage and output characteristics 
through resistance load. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The 
highest output was 2.7W.

  Fig. 7 (not reproduced) shows the relationship between 
electric current of high-temperature electrolytic cell made of 
solid zirconia electrolyte (covered in our study) and impressed 
voltage. Also shown in the diagram is a comparison of 
current-voltage characteristics of the thermoelectric power 
generator. We can see from the chart that even with this level 
of power generating capability, electrolysis progresses and 
hydrogens are being produced. In order to increase the amount of 
hydrogen generated, it will be necessary to increase power 
generator's output. The power generator's current-voltage 
characteristics indicate that high resistance existing inside 
this generator is curbing output growth. As shown in Fig. 8, an 
element developed recently has a different shape and has the 
capacity to generate nearly 1 W power. Incorporation of this 
type of elements into the generator will enable us to obtain a 
greater output capacity.

<H5>    4. Conclusion </H5>
  We have produced a highly efficient solar receiver made of 
porous ceramics. We were able to learn that, by heating this 
solar receiver with a large-scale solar concentrator installed 
at Tohoku University, the electrolytic cell and thermal power 
generating elements can be maintained at a stable high 
temperature. By using a power generator equipped with 120 
FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  thermal power generating elements, we have 
succeeded in producing 2.7W electric power. These results 
clearly state that experimentally it would be possible to 
construct the type of hydrogen manufacturing system based on a 
high-temperature vapor electrolysis using only solar energy 
(shown in Fig. 1) as its primary energy. Our future plans are to 
use FeSi&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  elements with low internal resistance to 
produce a power generator with the optimal heat design and to 
develop high-efficiency hydrogen generation system.
