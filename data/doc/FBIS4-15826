  [Text] Tallinn, Apr 11, BNS -- The Estonian Rural Center 
Party [ECRP] and Pro Patria agreed in the course of talks today 
to sign the inter-party agreement on Thursday [14 April], ERCP 
chairman Ivar Raig told BNS. 
  Raig said the two parties still haven't reached agreement on 
exempting farmers and other individual producers from the income 
tax and on reforming the government. If compromise isn't 
achieved on Wednesday when the negotiations continue, Raig said, 
the differences will be established in additional protocols, 
which most probably will be concluded in May. 
  If agreement isn't reached, the ERCP may still leave the 
ruling coalition, Raig claimed. He added the decision will be 
made at the party's annual conference early in June. 
  The preliminary text of the agreement contains proposals 
concerning regional policy, the property and the land reforms, 
taxation and financing of agriculture, protection of the 
domestic farming produce market, government reform, and 
establishment of an agricultural scientific, educational and 
consulting system.
