  [Text] Tallinn, May 18, BNS -- The United States supports 
the setting up of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion, Charles W. 
Freeman, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for issues of 
international security told Estonian leaders yesterday. 
  Washington will allocate up to 10 million dollars as support 
for the formation of the battalion, Estonian Defense Minister 
Indrek Kannik quoted Freeman as saying. 
  Freeman and Kannik also discussed the opportunities for 
military cooperation between Estonia and the United States, as 
well as their working closely under NATO's Partnership for Peace 
program. 
  The high Pentagon official had meetings today with President 
Lennart Meri, Foreign Minister Juri Luik, Defense Minister 
Indrek Kannik, the country's commander in chief, Aleksander 
Einseln, and members of the parliament's defense and foreign 
affairs commissions. 
  Freeman at a press conference later in the day said the 
United States has no plans to set up its military bases in the 
Baltics. He said such a prospect was rather unlikely at a time 
when America is cutting down the number of its bases abroad. 
This is not a political decision, but a purely realistic 
approach, he said. 
  While commenting on the Estonian-Russian relations, he said 
the Estonian Government is having at its disposal the 
possibilities to resolve the existing problems. Freeman said 
the U.S. Administration supports Estonia's position at the talks 
with Russia. 
  Russia ought to understand that Estonia stays in the center 
of attention of the U.S. President and the government, he said.
