  [Text] Pakistan has convened a meeting of seven-member 
Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] Contact Group on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on 27 April to discuss the deteriorating 
situation in Gorazde. The contact group comprises the foreign 
ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, 
Senegal and Malaysia. 
  Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto two days back had 
sent 
a message to the UN secretary general calling for immediate air 
strikes against the Serbian artillery surrounding Gorazde which 
is one of the six safe areas declared by the United Nations. 
The prime minister had also demanded the lifting of the arms 
embargo on Bosnian forces. It is expected that Pakistan will 
strongly present these demands at the ICO foreign ministers 
meeting.
