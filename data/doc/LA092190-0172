DEFENSE CONSULTANT GETS PRISON 
Defense consultant William M. Galvin was sentenced to 32 months in prison today 
for bribing two senior Pentagon officials to influence the awarding of 
lucrative military contracts. 
Galvin, 59, a major figure in the defense procurement scandal, was also fined 
$10,000 by U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria, Va., on his 
guilty plea to conspiracy, bribery and tax evasion. 
With another 32-month prison term given to a former Unisys Corp. executive, 
Galvin's sentence was the longest imposed in the long-running investigation of 
Pentagon procurement fraud.
