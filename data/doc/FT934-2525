FT  14 DEC 93 / China tries to improve air safety
China's aviation industry is in crisis after a spate of hijackings and three
air crashes this year, according to the country's civil aviation chief.
Mr Jiang Zhuping, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC),
urged drastic measures to improve pilot performance and guard against
further disasters. He was quoted in the English-language China Daily
yesterday as calling for air safety to be an 'overwhelming priority'.
His comments coincided with the ninth hijacking this year of a Chinese
airliner to Taiwan, further compounding Beijing's embarrassment over its air
safety record. The hijacker commandeered the aircraft by pretending to have
a bomb in his pocket.
'Every airline, airport, navigation and maintenance unit will be checked in
the campaign to close safety loopholes and tighten discipline,' Mr Jiang
said.
He warned that those responsible for failing to uphold safety standards
would face criminal prosecution. Procedures at China's hard-pressed airports
are lax.
CAAC has sent inspection teams to airports and airlines throughout China to
check on standards. 'Poorly qualified pilots would either be demoted or have
their licences revoked,' China Daily said.
International aviation experts have long been warning that China's airline
boom (new airlines have mushroomed in the past few years to cope with a
surge in demand) has put an intolerable strain on resources.
The rash of hijackings to Taiwan has fuelled tensions between Beijing and
Taipei, with China alleging that the Taiwanese refusal to repatriate
hijackers was compounding the problem. In Taipei, Mr Jason Hu, Taiwan
government spokesman, mocked Chinese safety standards. 'In one of the
hijackings, a bar of soap was used. This time it's something in a pocket.
Next time a toothpick will do.'
China's air passenger traffic is growing by at least 25 per cent a year, the
fastest in the world. It now has 39 registered airlines.
