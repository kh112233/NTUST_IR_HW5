FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (9): Focus on 'quality' sectors - Tourism
BARELY 10 days after the departure of thousands of businessmen expected at
Dubai's International Aerospace Exhibition next week, thousands of a
different kind of visitor are scheduled to pour into Dubai from India,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to hear pop star Michael
Jackson at a sell-out concert in a local soccer stadium.
Such is the magnetic pull of Dubai and its government-sponsored promotional
organisations - notably the Dubai Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board, the
Dubai National Air Travel Agency, and the travel management division of
Emirates, Dubai's airline.
Attendances at both exhibition and concert are almost certain to be inflated
thanks to the timely decision last month by the Dubai government to open the
emirate for short visits to white-collar residents of all Gulf Co-operation
Council countries regardless of nationality. Previously only citizens of GCC
countries - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia - had been
allowed into Dubai without a visit or transit visa provided by a Dubai-based
sponsor.
Dubai's success in selling itself as a tourist and conference-exhibition
centre is reflected in the aggregate figures for local hotel occupancies.
These show the total number of visitors - business and tourist - increasing
by 50 per cent between 1990 and 1992, despite the temporary but dramatic
fall-off caused by the Gulf war.
The majority of these visitors are staying in deluxe or first-class hotels,
but the biggest proportional increase in the same period - more than 250 per
cent - have been visitors at the lower-income end of the market.
Dubai's Promotion Board now maintains offices in seven countries for North
America, Europe, Hong Kong and Japan. An example of its success is that
Dubai now features on the books of 38 German tour operators alone. The
general manager of Frankfurt-based Airtours said in September there had been
a steady increase in the German demand for holidays to the Emirates. But the
reasons he gave - 'very high standards of quality, service, and security,' -
apply to all the countries where Dubai has made a visible impact on both the
summer and winter tourist markets. And because Dubai is a cosmopolitan city,
language is not a problem for any visitor, regardless of nationality.
Russians and citizens of other former Soviet republics are a fairly recent
addition to Dubai's tourist market. They descend by the planeload on Dubai
and neighbouring emirates, not wearing uniforms, but selling them - along
with medals, Russian dolls and other paraphernalia. Dubai's traders welcome
them. They barter the Russian goods for television sets, radios and all
kinds of consumer durables.
Those who have seen the Russians' departure say there is not a square inch
of aircraft aisle or emergency exit which is not packed to the ceiling with
man and metal for the home market.
Many of Dubai's existing five-star hotels are expanding. The luxury Jebel
Ali hotel could be adding 100 rooms to its present 275; and the Hatta Fort
hotel, an oasis in Dubai's desert and mountain hinterland, has doubled
capacity and added a conference facility. J. P. Marriott opened a five-star
hotel last September and a new Forte Grand opens next April. The luxury
hotel construction spree is probably not over yet.
The chief executive of Dubai's Promotion Board, Mr Khalid Bin Sulayem, says
his organisation's efforts are moving towards 'quality' tourism and
incentive travel visitors. It was the Promotion Board which intitiated the
new entry freedoms for GCC residents, an initiative which has already been
endorsed by GCC regional chambers of commerce.
But the icing on the cake for Dubai's leisure market must surely be the
three all-grass golf courses, and their related facilities. Emirates Golf
Club, opened in 1988, is the home to the PGA Desert Classic. Dubai Creek
Golf &amp; Yacht Club, completed only last November, has a flood-lit three-hole
course and driving range in addition to its 18-hole course. The newest of
all, Dubai Golf &amp; Racing Club at Nad Al Shiba on the desert outskirts of
Dubai city, has a nine-hole flood-lit course next to the racetrack and
paddock.
Dubai Racing Club, which owns and manages the race course will have its
first full season this winter. It is internationally recognised, which means
pedigrees of owners appear in catalogues everywhere and jockeys registered
in Dubai can race anywhere.
Thoroughbreds trained in Dubai are now entering - and being placed - in
races in Europe. And Dubai Racing Club's facilities for club members and
sponsors, including hospitality boxes, make facilities at Europe's
traditional race courses seem very inadequate by comparison.
