FT  15 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Terms of Czech central bank
Eurobond altered
BONDHOLDERS have voted in favour of changing the documentation of a Dollars
200m Eurobond issued last year by Statni Banka, the Czechoslovakian central
bank. Without the change, the bonds would have gone into default when
Czechoslovakia splits into Slovak and Czech republics on January 1.
As part of the break up, the state bank will be dissolved and its role will
be taken over by new central banks for each of the republics, according to
Nomura International, which arranged the original issue.
The bondholders agreed that the issue should be the joint responsibility of
the Slovak and Czech republics and changed an event of default clause which
provided for early redemption of the bonds in the event of Czechoslovakia
breaking up, according to lead manger Nomura International.
Of the original Dollars 200m issue size, Dollars 188.9m was outstanding
before the vote, the balance having been repurchased by the borrower. The
vote in favour of the changes accounted for Dollars 160.8m, with no votes
against. The deal, which matures in November 1994, is now trading at a
margin of 400 basis points over the comparable US Treasury yield, 100 basis
points higher than at launch a year ago. A Y10bn placement for Statni Banka
in the Japanese market is undergoing a similar process.
