  [Text] Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has 
stressed that his country received positive signals concerning a 
solution in the near future to the siege clamped on the Port of 
al-'Aqabah. He noted that U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher might convey to Jordan's Monarch King Husayn such a 
U.S. position during their meeting in London today. 
  At a news conference, al-Majali said that Washington is 
serious about reaching a solution to this issue, and that the 
United States has accepted Jordan's proposal to deploy observers 
from Lloyds Register at the Port of al-'Aqabah instead of 
inspecting ships at sea. However, he said that if the present 
situation continues, Jordan will adhere to its stand of 
suspending its participation in the peace talks. He noted that 
Syria supports the Jordanian stand on the siege on al-'Aqabah, 
and that a Syrian-Jordanian meeting will be held before the 
resumption of bilateral talks with Israel, which are scheduled 
to begin in early May.
