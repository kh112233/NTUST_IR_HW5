POLITICIANS, TAX HIKES AND GAS TAX MEASURES 
It is time to say no to more than just drugs! On Jan. 1, Social Security taxes 
increased a hefty 15.3%. Willie Brown is proposing that the temporary 
quarter-cent earthquake tax be made permanent, as though that should come as a 
surprise. 
On Nov. 6 we will be asked to vote for a 100% increase in the state gasoline 
tax, from 9 cents to 18 cents a gallon. 
After the Orange County voters overwhelmingly turned down a sales tax increase 
called Prop. A, the officials came back with a $2.5-million-plus campaign to 
try and sell one more increase called Measure M. The ink is hardly dry from the 
reports of that defeat, and here they are coming back to the trough one more 
time and proposing one more vote on the same twice-defeated tax increase. 
This time every voter should get out and leave little doubt in these 
non-representative official minds that no means no!
