FT  25 APR 94 / Complaints panel set up
The World Bank moved to fend off criticism of its operations by appointing a
three-man independent inspection panel to receive and investigate any
complaints that the bank has failed to follow its procedures and policies in
projects that it supports.
The panel  - described by World Bank president, Mr Lewis Preston, as
providing 'a safety net in exceptional cases where standards are not met'  -
will be chaired by Mr Ernst-Gunther Broder, a German and former president of
the European Investment Bank.
The other members will be Mr Alvaro Umana Queseda, a former minister of
natural resources in Costa Rica and Mr Richard Etter Bissell, who was an
official with the US agency for international development. The three have
been appointed for five, four and three years respectively.
The bank said the panel complements its existing quality control systems in
project preparation and is part of its policy of improving accountability
and openness.
An investigation by the panel must be requested by people adversely affected
by a bank project and approved by the bank's executive board. The bank will
publish reports by the panel and the bank's response to them.
The World Bank is the first multilateral development bank to set up such a
panel. The move follows criticism that some bank-financed projects have been
harmful to the environment and the indigenous peoples of the countries in
which they have been carried out.
