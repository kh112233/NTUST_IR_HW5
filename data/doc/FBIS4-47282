  [Abstract] A technology of automatic pH control by the 
volt-ampere method with a hard indicator electrode has been 
developed at the Institute's electrochemical laboratory for 
monitoring the reactants participating in gold extraction from 
pulp. As reactants are being used thiourea or sodium cyanide. 
Two transducer configurations are proposed, one with a bar 
electrode in an epoxy sleeve and one with a long enamel-coated 
wire electrode. As the electrode material have been selected 
graphite for use with thiourea and graphite or copper for use 
with sodium cyanide. A graphite electrode is also used for 
monitoring iron in FeSO[.sub]4[/] solution (Fe++ Fe+++ 
oxidation reaction) and for monitoring gold in thiourea or NaCN 
solution. Both electrodes are renewable ones, purity being 
restored by mechanically slicing off a thin surface layer. The 
electrical conductivity of the reactants is usually adequate for 
accurate measurements, especially when some 
H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] has been added. The operating 
ranges are: 5-20C for copper electrode with NaCN, 
10-40C for graphite electrode with NaCN, 20-50C for 
graphite electrode with thiourea. Each transducer includes an 
electronic circuit for compensating the effect of temperature 
fluctuations within those ranges. For monitoring the gold 
content has been devised the inverse volt-ampere method, to 
either replace or supplement conventional method of atomic 
absorption spectrometry. The analyzer with any of the two 
transducers operates with direct current in either the straight 
mode or the differential mode, recording the current at the 
instant when the analytical signal peaks. It includes a 
regulator of the electrode renewal cycle needed for polarization 
and measurements of the variable voltage. The apparatus, built 
at the by the Scientific-Industrial Association 
``Soyuzalmazozolotoavtomatika'' (All-Union Diamond and Gold 
Automation), has successfully passed lengthy tests in a gold 
extraction plant. Tables 1; references 15.
