FT  01 OCT 93 / Appeal planned over Iraq arms case
LAWYERS acting for a British businessman convicted of illegally exporting
arms to Iraq plan to appeal against the decision after the Scott
arms-for-Iraq inquiry uncovered evidence of government interference with
defence witnesses.
Although the trial of Mr Reginald Dunk took place in 1985, lawyers acting
for him believe they have good grounds now to argue that the conviction was
unsafe.
Appearing before the Scott inquiry in June, Sir Peter Egerton, a former
under-secretary at the Foreign Office, said that Customs officials had asked
Foreign Office officials to dissuade staff from the Jordanian and Iraqi
embassies from giving evidence on Mr Dunk's behalf.
Mr Dunk's solicitor, Sir Basil Rhodes, confirmed yesterday that he had
written to lawyers acting for Customs and Excise, which prosecuted the case
originally, to discuss possible compensation. He said that no figure had
been mentioned although his client had mentioned a figure of Pounds 1m.
Sir Basil said last night: 'The conviction is patently unsafe and improper
because there was an attempt to gerrymander the evidence.'
Customs would not comment on the case last night. But officials indicated
they were unlikely to agree to compensation without the case first going to
the appeal court.
The Dunk case falls outside the period being examined by the Scott inquiry
although the relationship between the judiciary and Whitehall falls within
Lord Justice Scott's terms of reference.
