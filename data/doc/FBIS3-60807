  [Text] Cairo, 27 Dec (MENA)--The Prosecution Office in Misr 
al-Qadimah this afternoon began investigations into the tourist 
bus incident that occurred in Misr al-Qadimah this morning. The 
Prosecution Office summoned the bus driver, Muhammad Safiy. He 
said that at 0845 today, he saw at the scene of the incident two 
terrorists. One of them hurled what looked like a stone at the 
bus from the left side of the road. He said that the object hit 
the glass and fell to the ground, but nothing happened. He 
noted that, afterward, he heard an explosion and gunfire. He 
sped away in the bus after the explosion smashed bus windows and 
damaged the inside. He said that he stopped the bus after a 
short distance because the criminals had disappeared down a side 
street and because of the commotion caused by a number of 
injured tourists. 
  The Misr al-Qadimah Prosecution Office also summoned 
witnesses 'Abd-al-Rahman Muhanna, a bricklayer, and Rajab 
Jad-al-Rabb, a carpenter. Both witnesses gave the same evidence 
as the bus driver, but they also described the two terrorists. 
They noted that one of the criminals kicked the explosive 
charge, which did not explode. It rolled about 10 meters and 
then exploded near a cafe, injuring some customers. They also 
said that one of the two terrorists was wearing jeans and a 
military jacket and the other was wearing a black jacket and 
gray trousers. Both terrorists, who were carrying pistols, 
managed to escape down a side street leading to the corniche 
while firing indiscriminately. The Prosecution Office decided 
to keep the bus and entrusted intelligence personnel to 
apprehend the criminals quickly. It also asked the criminal 
laboratory to quickly prepare a report on the incident.
