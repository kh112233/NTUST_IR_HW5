FT  14 OCT 92 / German far-right threat
RADICAL right-wing movements will present the most serious threat since 1945
to Germany's political stability, two German specialists warned this week.
A large number of Germans in the east and west already supported militant
right-wing opposition to asylum-seekers entering and living in Germany,
according to Mr Ernst Uhrlau of the Hamburg Agency for the Protection of the
Constitution, which collects and evaluates information about German
extremist movements. They had become disillusioned with the existing main
parties.
He feared that extremist parties would come to represent the 'silent
majority' of Germans who were being pushed towards the extreme right.
Right-wing extremists, whom he numbered at at least 60,000, had provoked
1,400 assaults this year.
Mr Uhrlau was speaking at a conference organised by the Aspen Institute in
Berlin.
Mr Claus Leggewie, professor of political science at the University of
Giessen, said he believed that as much as 20 per cent of the German
electorate had passively supported right-wing extremist views in the past.
He feared such people would actively support parties espousing those views
in the 1994 national elections.
In Bonn yesterday, leaders of Germany's governing parties agreed that asylum
seekers from states deemed free of political persecution should be expelled
immediately without a court hearing. However, the draft plan requires a
constitutional amendment which depends on the backing of the opposition
Social Democrats.
