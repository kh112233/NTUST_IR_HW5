FT  11 MAR 92 / London rail bomb blast causes chaos
A BOMB exploded early yesterday near Wandsworth Common railway station in
south-west London, disrupting train services in the capital but causing no
injuries.
The bomb exploded in a junction box alongside the track about 30 minutes
after the police received a telephone warning. The area had been evacuated
by the time the bomb went off.
Shortly after the blast another security alert caused Liverpool Street main
line station to be closed and Underground services from there were
suspended.
The police said telephoned warnings using code words had been given in each
incident. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the incidents, but they are
in line with the current IRA campaign of disrupting train services. Last
month an IRA bomb at London Bridge station injured 28 people.
The IRA has warned that it will continue its campaign on the mainland in an
attempt to force Northern Ireland politics on to the general election
agenda.
British Rail said services to and from Victoria would be delayed and reduced
in the next few days and emergency timetables would be used.
