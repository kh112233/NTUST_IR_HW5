FT  29 DEC 93 / Extremists admit Cairo bus attack
An extremist Islamic group, Gama'a al-Islamiyah, yesterday claimed
responsibility for an attack on a tourist bus in Cairo, which wounded 16
people, eight of them Austrians, writes Shahira Idriss from Cairo. Two of
the Austrians were critically injured.
Attackers on Monday hurled two bombs into the bus, which was on a tour of
old Cairo, and opened fire on the passengers, before escaping.
Gama'a al Islamiyah is one of the main extremist groups aiming to topple the
Egyptian government and replace it with an Islamic state.
