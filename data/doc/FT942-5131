FT  06 JUN 94 / Pledge on German immigration laws
Germany's Free Democratic party will seek to introduce an immigration law if
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coalition is returned to power after the
federal election in October. Germany is one of the few countries in the
European Union which has no immigration legislation.
During its three-day congress in the northern city of Rostock which ended
yesterday, the FDP also agreed in principle to reform Germany's outdated
1913 citizenship laws, and give foreigners easier access to voting in local
government elections.
Under current legislation, a child is granted automatic citizenship if one
of its parents is German. This excludes over 6.5m foreigners living in the
country.
The need to reform Germany's outdated laws received a boost after Ms
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, head of the Federal Office for the Problems of
Foreigners, was elected by the congress to the FPD presidium, the top
echelon in the party's organisation.
'It is high time we introduced change,' said Ms Schmalz-Jacobsen, who has
campaigned for a reform of the law and dual citizenship. 'How can we
integrate foreigners if we do not give them rights? Germany, in any case, is
de facto a country of immigration. It is time we faced up to it.' The
Bundestag, or lower house, last month threw out a bill allowing dual
nationality. Mr Kohl's CDU and even some FPD deputies opposed it.
Although the FDP had voted at the weekend to continue to support the CDU-led
coalition, in which it is the junior partner, it agreed to oppose any
attempts by the government to extend security surveillance by bugging
private homes. It also voted to scrap a law requiring registered churchgoers
to pay tax. Church membership has sharply fallen among east Germans since
unification because the tax levy is deemed excessive.
