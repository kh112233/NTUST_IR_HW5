NATION; 
MAIMED DRUNK WINS $9 MILLION 
A man who lost an arm after falling on subway tracks while drunk has been 
awarded $9.3 million by a jury. "God bless America," said Francisco Marino, 30, 
a Mexican citizen who had been in the United States for one year working as a 
dishwasher before the April, 1989, accident. 
City transit officials said they will appeal Wednesday's state Supreme Court 
decision, which compensates Marino for pain and suffering and loss of earnings. 
He was hit by a northbound train after falling. 
Marino's lawyer, Alan Shapey, contended that his client would not have fallen 
in front of the train if transit officials had followed their guidelines to 
"take charge" of disabled or intoxicated people, at least until a police 
officer arrives, to ensure their safety.
