<H5>  The Hoang Sa [Paracel] and Truong Sa [Spratly] archipelagoes: </H5>
  These two archipelagoes are located in the heart of the 
Eastern Sea. Since time immemorial, they have been habitually 
called by our people the Bai Cat Vang [Golden Sand Bank], the 
Hoang Sa or Van Ly Truong Sa Island. On their ancient maps, 
Western seafarers used to describe these two archipelagoes as 
the Paracels. 
  The two archipelagoes of Hoang Sa and Truong Sa are made up 
of many islets, underwater sand banks and rock formations, and 
coral reefs. 
  On Western seafarers' ancient maps, these two archipelagoes 
are symbolized by a triangular flag, that shows they are 
situated along our country's coastline. The flag has its head 
located at the same latitude as Danang and its tail at the same 
latitude as the lower part of the Nam Bo Delta. 
  For some centuries now, due to the growth of the maritime 
sector and based on the results of many marine topographical 
surveys, these archipelagoes have been divided into two separate 
groups with Hoang Sa archipelago in the north and Truong Sa in 
the south. 
  Both the Hoang Sa and Truong Sa archipelagoes are situated 
in 
a sea area rich in natural resources -- marine life and mineral 
ores -- where there are high prospects for oil and gas 
exploitation. These two archipelagoes, which have a commanding 
view of the international sea route linking the Pacific with the 
Indian Ocean and the Atlantic, are places where strategic bases 
can be set up to control various sea routes crisscrossing the 
Eastern Sea. 
  The Hoang Sa archipelago is made up of over 30 rock islets, 
coral atolls, and sand banks stretching out into an area which 
is approximately 100 nautical miles long and 85 nautical miles 
wide. With an area of some 15,000 square km, the archipelago is 
located at 15.45-17.15 degrees north latitude and 111-113 
degrees east longitude, about 120 nautical miles from the Ly Son 
islet (also known as Cu Lao Re), 140 nautical miles from China's 
nearest island of Hainan, and 170 nautical miles from Danang.
