 

(b) Lower river natural fall chinook ocean escapement is forecast at about 14,700 adults, 10 percent above the 1993
run size of 13,400. 
(c) Lower river hatchery fall chinook ocean escapement is forecast at 36,100 adults, a 31 percent reduction from the
record low return observed in 1993 of 52,200 adults. This stock has been declining sharply since the record high return
in 1987. Lower Columbia River fall chinook stocks normally account for more than half the total catch in Council-area
fisheries north of Cape Falcon, with lower river hatchery fall chinook being the single largest contributing stock.

(d) Spring Creek hatchery fall chinook ocean escapement is projected to be about 20,200 adults, 20 percent above the
1993 return of 16,800 adults; the 19861990 average ocean escapement was 16,700 adults. The Spring Creek hatchery
fall chinook stock has been rebuilding slowly since the record low return in 1987, with a downturn in 1992 and 1993.

(e) Mid-Columbia bright fall chinook ocean escapement is projected to be about 23,900 adults, 13 percent below the
1993 return of 27,400 adults. These fall chinook are returns primarily from hatchery releases of bright fall chinook
stock in the area below McNary Dam, although some natural spawning in tributaries between Bonneville and McNary dams
is also occurring.

Snake River Wild Fall Chinook. 

Also of concern are Snake River wild fall chinook, listed as a threatened species under the ESA. Information on the
stock's ocean distribution and fishery impacts are not available. Attempts to evaluate fishery impacts on Snake
River wild fall chinook have used the Lyons Ferry Hatchery stock to represent Snake River wild fall chinook. The Lyons
Ferry stock is widely distributed and harvested by ocean fisheries from southern California to Alaska. 
5. 

Washington Coastal and Puget Sound Chinook. 

Washington coastal and Puget Sound chinook generally migrate to the far north and are affected insignificantly by
ocean harvests from Cape Falcon to the U.S.-Canada border. 



Coho Salmon Stocks 



The Oregon Production Index (OPI) is an annual index of coho abundance from Leadbetter Point, WA, south through California.
It is the primary index of coho abundance for the Pacific ocean fishery. Oregon coastal and Columbia River coho stocks
are the primary components of the OPI. Beginning in 1988, the Council adopted revised estimation procedures that
were expected more accurately to predict abundance of the following individual OPI area stock components: public
hatchery, private hatchery, Oregon coastal natural (OCN) for rivers and lakes, and the Salmon Trout Enhancement
Program. Prediction methodologies are described in the Council's ``Preseason Report I Stock Abundance Analysis
for 1988 Ocean Salmon Fisheries.'' In response to the extremely low abundances expected in 1994, some changes to the
abundance predictors were implemented as described in the Council's ``Preseason Report I Stock Abundance Analysis
for 1994 Ocean Salmon Fisheries.'' In particular, the current predictor for the OCN river component does not adequately
incorporate environmental variability, so an environment-based model is being used to predict abundance in 1994.
This model incorporates annual measurements of upwelling and sea surface temperatures and contains no provision
for the influence of spawner escapement. Further analysis of this model will occur before the 1995 season. The 1994
OPI is forecast to be a record low 239,700 coho, 69 percent below the 1993 preseason forecast of 767,000 coho, and 49
percent below the 1993 observed level of 470,900 fish. The 1994 estimate includes a record low of 140,900 OCN coho,
44 percent below the 1993 observed level of 250,800 fish and 27 percent below the previous record low of 192,500 fish
observed in 1987. The 1993 spawning escapement of the OCN stock was 170,200 fish. 
All Washington coastal and Puget Sound natural coho stocks are expected to be less abundant than forecast in 1993.
Abundances for Washington coastal stocks of Hoh, Queets, and Grays Harbor natural coho are projected to be 40 percent,
47 percent, and about 60 percent below the 1993 preseason predictions, respectively. Abundances for Puget Sound
stocks of Skagit, Stillaguamish, and Hood Canal natural coho are projected to be 45 percent, 65 percent, and 72 percent
below the 1993 preseason predictions, respectively. Even in the absence of ocean and inside (Strait of Juan de Fuca
and Puget Sound) fisheries, natural coho run sizes are forecast to be well below spawning escapement goals. These
low expected abundances are thought to be the result of low freshwater flows in 1992, poor marine survival associated
with anomalous ocean conditions, and long-term habitat degradation. Abundance forecasts for Washington coastal
and Puget Sound hatchery production are also well below 1993 expectations. 



Pink Salmon Stocks 



Major pink salmon runs return to the Fraser River and Puget Sound only in odd-numbered years. Consequently, pink salmon
runs are not of management concern in 1994. 



Management Measures for 1994 



The Council adopted allowable ocean harvest levels and management measures for 1994 that are consistent with the
FMP and are designed to apportion the burden of protecting the weak stocks discussed above equitably among ocean fisheries
and to allow maximum harvest of natural and hatchery runs surplus to inside fishery and spawning needs. The management
measures below reflect the Council's recommendations.
