FT  13 MAY 94 / Senate acts over abortion blockades
The US Senate yesterday followed the House of Representatives in passing, by
69 votes to 30, a bill making it a federal crime to conduct violent or
intimidatory blockades against clinics performing abortions.
The legislation, which President Bill Clinton strongly supports and will
sign, was prompted by actions taken against abortion clinics in recent
years, including cases of arson, bombing and, last year, the murder of a
doctor in Florida and the shooting of another in Kansas.
The bill, laying out penalties for offenders, was vigorously opposed by the
right-to-life movement on the grounds that it infringed lawful civil
disobedience. But the only concession was to grant similar protection to
houses of worship.
Opponents of abortion suffered a second, if less decisive, defeat yesterday
when a House subcommittee voted against excluding abortion coverage from the
healthcare bill.
