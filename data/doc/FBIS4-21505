  [Text] In 1992, the European Union turned out 43.6 million 
tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) of renewable sources of energy, 
according to the EU's Statistical Office. Eurostat's energy 
figures released on March 7, which include, for the first time, 
data on renewable energy -- solar, geothermal, wind, 
hydro-power, and biomass -- show that renewable accounted for 
6.7 percent of total primary energy production in 1992. 
Although still a very small proportion of the overall energy 
balance, this figure is a marked improvement on the less than 5 
percent share that renewable sources held in the mid-1980s.

  Renewable energy consumption accounted for 3.5 percent of 
gross inland energy consumption in 1992, notes Eurostat. 
Households consumed 16.2 million toe of biomass (wood, wood 
waste, municipal solid waste and biogas), particularly wood, 
which represents roughly 7 percent of their final energy 
consumption. Hydro-power (13.8 million toe) made up 8.2 percent 
of total electricity production. France is the biggest producer, 
turning out 5.9 million toe. Denmark was the biggest producer of 
wind energy (78,000 toe). But this was a mere 0.06 percent of 
total EU electricity production. 
  Gross inland consumption by all energy sources followed the 
same trend as in recent years: coal down, oil stable and 
natural gas up. Total consumption for each source was: hard 
coal 15.6 percent, lignite 5.2 percent, oil 43.5 percent and 
natural gas 18.6 percent, thermal energy produced in nuclear 
power stations 13.6 percent and renewable energy 3.5 percent. 
The EU's dependence on energy imports was still 50 percent. 
  A separate set of figures just out from Eurostat shows 
further decline in EU coal industry in 1993. Output of hard 
coal fell even faster between 1992 and 1993 as a result of the 
crisis in the steel industry and particularly low import prices. 
It fell by some 26 million tonnes or 14 percent to 158.6 
million tonnes. This compares with an 8.4 million drop (4.3 
percent) between 1991 and 1992. Demand from both steel and power 
industries fell, perhaps by as much as over 20 million tonnes at 
EU level. This resulted in falls in imports from non-EU 
countries.
