FT  20 FEB 93 / Tests on new cancer drugs show promise
THREE new approaches to cancer treatment are giving promising results in
early clinical tests, a conference in London on the study of tumours was
told yesterday.
All three result from collaborative research involving Scotia
Pharmaceuticals, a UK-Canadian drug company, and university medical centres
in the UK and overseas.
Potentially the most far-reaching treatment is a tumour-killing drug, EF13,
which Scotia described as a 'magic bullet' which could destroy cancer cells
without harming normal tissues.
Preliminary clinical trials indicate that the drug may double the survival
time of patients with late-stage pancreatic and breast cancers.
If the drugs continue to show promise they could be available commercially
within three or four years.
