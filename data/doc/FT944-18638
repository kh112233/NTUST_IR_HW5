FT  03 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Iran's currency woes
Iran's interior ministry has ordered private foreign exchange dealers to
stop conducting business or have their money confiscated, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday. The ministry said it was
acting because of repeated complaints about 'profiteering middlemen
illegally' issuing counterfeit money at unofficial exchanges. The central
bank said official exchange centers will be set up across the country to
sell foreign currency to travellers.
