  [Text] The Philippines and Indonesia have agreed to three 
principles to govern its special meeting in the drawing up of 
maritime boundary. This was announced by Philippine Foreign 
Affairs Undersecretary Rodolfo Severino. The principles include 
the applicability of international laws and the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, which goes into effect this 
year, to establish the extent of national maritime jurisdiction. 
  Another is the adoption of the medium-line principle, 
whenever applicable, which set boundaries between two designated 
points. And the third is the adoption of (?uncertified) 
creative option. 
  Undersecretary Severino said the principles were agreed upon 
in the two-day talks in Manado last week and further talks would 
cover the area including the Celebes Sea and Cape San Agustin in 
the southern Philippines. Severino said designating borders 
could help prevent the occurrence in which Filipinos are 
arrested for fishing in Indonesian borders without a permit.
