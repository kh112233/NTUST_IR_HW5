  [Text] Local delegates to China's legislature are to 
question the procuratorate over the handling of the case of Xi 
Yang, a Hong Kong reporter detained for allegedly stealing 
government financial information. 
  Concern was expressed at yesterday's meeting of the National 
People's Congress (NPC) after a faxed appeal from the Hong Kong 
Journalists' Association. The letter highlighted the lack of 
transparency surrounding the case and criticised the delay in 
the hearing. It cited China's Criminal Prosecution Law which 
stated that all criminal cases should be brought to the court 
within 1 1/2 months of the arrest. 
  Xi, a reporter for Ming Pao, was arrested by public security 
officers last September in Beijing. The authority later accused 
him of stealing state information. Officials from the judiciary 
have refused to reveal details of his case, saying it is being 
processed. 
  Outspoken lawyer Liu Yiu-chu queried why Xi had been barred 
from meeting relatives, colleagues and even his lawyer. "He 
should be punished through an open trial," she said.
