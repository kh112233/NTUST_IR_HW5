FT  27 AUG 93 / VW and the Lopez espionage affair: VW dossier
The raids yesterday by German police and prosecutors on Volkswagen's
headquarters and other facilities in Wolfsburg marked an extraordinary
day in the history of the German car industry. Officials in Bonn did not
hide their concern over the potential political and economic damage
which could ensue from the battle 'between two great German car
companies'.
Christopher Parkes examines the personalities and issues in what one
German judge said could be 'potentially the biggest-ever case of
industrial espionage'.
JOSE IGNACIO LOPEZ DE ARRIORTUA
VW production director
The metamorphosis of Lopez into Superlopez, as he is known in his native
Basque country, started in 1980 when he left Firestone to join General
Motors in Spain. At 39, the workaholic engineer was able to test what has
become the core tenet in his management philosophy: the systematic
elimination from manufacturing of all processes which did not add value.
In 1986, as purchasing director for GM Spain, he decided that in-house
cost-saving methods should also be applied to parts suppliers. He would go
into their factories and offer them advice.
As one was to note: 'When Lopez tells us he will offer us a hand, I always
think of my throat.' His transformation into 'the strangler' and his rapid
rise through GM were under way.
He joined Adam Opel's main board in Germany in 1987, was appointed central
purchasing chief for GM Europe a year later, and moved to the parent board
in Detroit in January, 1992.
In the meantime, he was combining all his accumulated knowledge and
experience in Plateau 6, his planned 'dream' super-lean production plant, in
which cars would be assembled from modules in less than half the time taken
in the best Japanese works.
He even had a site and outside funding for Plateau 6 in his birthplace in
Amorebieta. GM demurred and lost Superlopez to Volkswagen.

FERDINAND PIECH
VW chairman
'I was born a domesticated pig but live the life of a wild boar,' Piech says
of himself. It is his way of saying that, despite his birthright of
privilege and immense wealth, he live like a normal man: 'High living holds
no joy for me.'
He is the grandson of VW 'Beetle' inventor Ferdinand Porsche, and started
his career in the family luxury sports car company, of which he owns 10 per
cent.
The 56-year-old engineer is father of 12 children. But he reserves his
pride, in public at least, for his technical achievements.
Refused the chairmanship of Porsche, he joined Audi, the VW subsidiary, in
1972 as head of special development projects. He was responsible for the
brand's innovative integrated passenger security system, Procon-ten, and the
development of permanent four-wheel drive.
Piech became Audi chairman in 1988 and raised the profile of the marque to
match that of BMW and Mercedes-Benz. He also made a reputation as a loner
and a hard cost-cutter. Audi's return on sales rose from almost nil to 6 per
cent, and the company became VW's most profitable subsidiary.
In charge of the group since January this year, he claims already to have
DM8.7bn-worth of cost-savings 'in my pocket'. He says DM700m of that is due
to the work of Lopez 'my soul mate.'

BACKGROUND BRIEFING
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1992, NOVEMBER      Piech meets Lopez, recently-appointed vice-president
                 for procurement for GM in Detroit and former head
           of purchasing at Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary.
       Piech tries to persuade Lopez to join him at VW.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1993, JANUARY       GM 'puts on ice' Lopez's plan to build 'dream
          factory' in his Basque homeland,
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
FEBRUARY            Lopez meets a VW director to discuss 'possible'
            employment terms. Lower Saxony government, which
     owns a stake in VW, says Lopez will join VW next
month; he denies this.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
MARCH               Lopez signs VW contract and flies to inform GM in
              Detriot. VW announces appointment, but, after
    discussions with GM, Lopez agrees to stay on there.
GM wants Lopez to sign five-year contract, but,
according to a VW executive, he is 'very unhappy'.                     He
flies to a meeting with Piech, is taken to a VW                     board
meeting and formally appointed. In Detroit, GM                     searches
the offices of Lopez, and a close                     colleague's; GM
executive signs affidavit saying                     none of the secret and
confidential documents GM                     believes are in the men's
possession was found. Six                     GM/Opel executives also jump
ship, turning up at VW                     without, according to Lopez,
contracts or job                     offers.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
APRIL               GM writes to Lopez seeking unequivocal statement on
                GM/Opel documents it says are missing. Lopez replies
             that neither he nor colleagues took any secret
    documents nor had any now.                     Opel asks public
prosecutors to investigate possible                     theft and industrial
espionage.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MAY
                Lopez denies bringing any secret documents to VW,
          but prosecutors say they have enough information to
      launch a criminal investigation.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
JULY                US Justice Department starts own investigation.
            Lopez appears to contradict earlier claim he never
       took any documents but tells board any such
documents were destroyed.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
AUGUST              Opel welcomes 'belated' admission documents had been
                 destroyed but points out that investigations also
           involve allegations of theft, fraud and perjury.
    German economics minister Rexrodt holds a series of
meetings with heads of Opel and VW, but says this is                     for
information, and not mediation.                     VW appoints auditors to
carry out investigation.                     Police raid eight locations,
including VW HQ at                     Wolfsburg, in search of evidence over
industrial                     espionage allegations.
