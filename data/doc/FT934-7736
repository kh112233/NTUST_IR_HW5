FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (14): Ready but
not yet willing - United States
SOUTH AFRICA'S constitutional agreement will intensify US corporate and
investor interest, but few American companies seem likely to move quickly
into the Republic.
Mr Jonathan Huneke, investment policy manager at the US Council for
International Business, which represents some 300 multinationals, thinks
they will re-enter 'very cautiously, very quietly and very slowly'.
More than 200 US companies left South Africa in the 1980s, under pressure
from state and local government economic sanctions, which will take time to
be lifted.
With a constitutional agreement in prospect, many US companies have been
examining options in South Africa. Mr Tony O'Reilly, head of foods group HJ
Heinz, travelled to the country two years ago on an initial exploratory
trip.
A few companies have already taken the plunge. The Investor Responsibility
Research Center, a Washington-based monitoring group, reckons that at least
28 companies have gone into the Republic since mid-1991.
Large Wall Street brokerage houses and fund management groups, which stopped
handling South African securities in the 1980s are also preparing to get
back into the market.
Yet despite this surge of interest, most American corporations remain wary
of a significant exposure.
There remains a lingering distrust of the African National Congress, and
there is concern about the stability of the country after next year's
elections.
Analysts say these worries mean that many US companies will re-enter the
market through cautious routes - such as exports, joint ventures and
licensing agreements - and many will seek partners in the black community.
The same concerns mean that large US fund managers, who have been snapping
up stocks in so-called 'emerging markets' in Latin America and Asia, may be
leery of rushing into South African securities.
