  [Text] After the violent Kurdish protests of the past 
weeks, security experts now expect a more quiet period. In the 
view of the security authorities, the banned Workers Party of 
Kurdistan, PKK, is not interested in a more serious conflict 
with the German authorities. 
  "The PKK has succeeded in putting the Kurdish problem in the 
limelight again," a high ranking official told FOCUS, "now they 
are trying to gain ground on the political and diplomatic 
stage." This includes congresses in other West European 
countries, organized by camouflage organizations or 
suborganizations of the PKK and staffed with renowned scientists 
and politicians. 
  "One cannot speak of giving the all-clear," the official 
continued. There is no indication at all that the PKK is 
retreating from its double strategy -- constantly alternating 
between attacks and diplomatic efforts. 
  The security authorities still have problems with the 
strictly closed cadre structures of the PKK -- and the power of 
the functionaries to mobilize crowds in the shortest possible 
time. The fact that demonstrators do not always come 
voluntarily is shown by latest findings of the Augsburg police 
about the highway riots last week: Even Kurdish children were 
forced under threat of physical violence to get on the buses for 
Augsburg.
