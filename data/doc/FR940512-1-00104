less than six years of age (e.g., protruding corners, windowsills and frames, doors and frames, and other protruding
woodwork). 



Defective paint surface

 means a surface on which the paint 
is nonintact, i.e., the paint is cracking, scaling, chipping, peeling, or loose. 



Elevated blood lead level or EBL

Defective paint.

 In the case of a unit constructed before 1978 that is for a family that includes a child less than six years of age, the
initial inspection under 882.209(h)(1), and each periodic inspection under 882.211(b), shall include
an inspection for defective paint surfaces. Defective paint surfaces either must be tested for lead content or, if
defective paint surfaces are not tested, the presence of lead-based paint shall be assumed and the surfaces abated
as required by 35.24(b) of this title, in accordance with 882.209(h) or 882.211 (b) and (c), as
appro-


priate. ***

Chewable surfaces.

 In the case of a unit constructed before 1978 that is for a family that includes a child less than six years of age with
an identified EBL condition, the initial inspection under 882.209(h)(1), or a periodic inspection under
882.211(b), shall include a test for lead-based paint on chewable surfaces. Testing shall be conducted by
a State or local health or housing agency, by an inspector certified or regulated by a State or local health or housing
agency, or by an organization recognized by HUD. Lead content shall be tested by using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer
(XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings of 1 mg/cm2 or higher using an XRF shall be considered
positive for the presence of lead-based paint. If the laboratory reports the results in percent by weight the standard
shall be 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million (ppm). When lead based paint on chewable surfaces is identified, covering
or removal of the paint surface in accordance with 35.24(b)(4) of this title shall be required, in accordance
with 882.209(h) or 882.211 (b) and (c), as appropriate, and correction shall be completed within the
time limits set forth in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. 

(5) 

Abatement without testing.

 In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraph (i)(4) of this section, at its discretion the PHA may forego testing
and require the owner to abate all interior and exterior chewable surfaces in accordance with the method set out in
35.24(b)(4) of this title.

34. Section 882.404 would be amended by: 

a. Revising the second and last sentences of paragraph (c)(1); 

b. Removing the definition of ``applicable surface'' and revising the definitions of ``chewable surface'', ``defective
paint surface'', and ``elevated blood lead level or EBL'' in paragraph (c)(2); 

c. Revising the first two sentences of paragraph (c)(3); and 

d. Revising paragraphs (c) (4) and (5), to read as follows:

of this title and supersedes, with respect to all housing to which it applies, the requirements prescribed by part
35, subpart C of this title. *** This section does not apply to projects for the elderly or handicapped

Defective paint.

 In the case of a unit constructed before 1978 that is for a family that includes a child less than six years of age, the
initial inspection under 882.504(a), and each periodic inspection under 882.516(b), shall include
an inspection for defective paint surfaces. Defective paint surfaces either must be tested for lead content or, if
defective paint surfaces are not tested, the presence of lead-based paint shall be assumed and abatement of the surfaces
as required by 35.24(b) of this title shall be included in the specific work items referred to in 882.504(a)
or required as corrective action pursuant to 882.516(c), as appropriate. ***

Chewable surfaces.

 If a proposal is submitted with respect to a unit constructed before 1978 that is occupied by a family that includes
a child less than six years of age with an identified EBL condition, the PHA shall cause the unit to be tested for lead-based
paint on chewable surfaces. Testing shall be conducted by a State or local health or housing agency, by an inspector
certified or regulated by a State or local health or housing agency, or by an organization recognized by HUD. Lead content
shall be tested by using an X-ray fluorescence analyzer (XRF) or by laboratory analysis of paint samples. Test readings
of 1 mg/cm2 or higher using an XRF shall be considered positive for presence of lead-based paint. If the laboratory
reports the results in percent by weight 0.5 percent or 5000 parts per million (ppm) is the standard. When lead-based
paint on chewable surfaces is identified at initial inspection, covering or removal of the paint surface in accordance
with 35.24(b)(4) of this title shall be included in the specific work items referred to in 882.504(a).
When lead-based paint on chewable surfaces is discovered at periodic inspection, covering or removal of the paint
surface in accordance with 35.24(b)(4) of this title shall be completed within the time limits set forth in
paragraph (c)(3) of this section. 

(5) 

Abatement without testing.

 In lieu of the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, at its discretion the PHA may forego testing
and require the abatement of all interior and exterior chewable surfaces in accordance with 35.24(b)(4) of
this title.
