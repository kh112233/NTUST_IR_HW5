FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel obtains safety approval for
lorry wagons
THE ANGLO-French safety commission for the Channel tunnel has agreed that
Eurotunnel need not make expensive design changes to rail wagons planned to
transport lorries. Eurotunnel said that the commission's decision could
reduce the cost of the project by about Pounds 100m.
It said the safety commission, which was established by the British and
French governments, had agreed that heavy goods vehicles could be
transported in semi-open-sided wagons, provided Eurotunnel met other
stringent safety criteria.
The commission, concerned about the possibility of a fire spreading in the
tunnel, had previously indicated that it would prefer the wagons to be fully
enclosed.
Eurotunnel warned last year that changing the design of the shuttle wagons
at this late stage would increase costs and could cause delays in providing
a full service.
The group, in a letter to shareholders, re-asserted that it would have no
need to raise further funds before the tunnel opened next September or
within the fourth quarter of next year.
Sir Alastair Morton and Mr Andre Benard, joint chairmen of Eurotunnel, said
that they were convinced that a satisfactory settlement could be reached
with the companies building the tunnel. Contractors are claiming more than
Pounds 1bn in additional payments at 1987 prices to cover cost increases.
