'SUICIDE MACHINE' DOCTOR CASE WILL BE DROPPED 
A county prosecutor said Friday he will not appeal the dismissal of a 
first-degree murder charge against a retired pathologist whose "suicide 
machine" was used by an Alzheimer's disease patient to kill herself. 
The case against Dr. Jack Kevorkian, of Royal Oak, Mich., was thrown out 
Thursday by Oakland County District Judge Gerald McNally. 
His ruling followed two days of testimony and the viewing of a dramatic 
videotape in which Janet Adkins told Kevorkian, "I don't want to go on." 
Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., died June 4 in the back of Kevorkian's van in a 
remote park. She was hooked up to an intravenous device that permitted her to 
inject herself with a lethal solution. 
Oakland County prosecutor Richard Thompson said Friday that he will not appeal 
the ruling and that it is time for the Michigan Legislature to eliminate 
confusion over assisting in suicides. 
He said he was not conceding that it was legal, but he would not pursue further 
legal action against Kevorkian. 
"I think this is a question preeminently for the legislative branch of 
government," Thompson said, pointing to a movement in the state Senate to make 
assisting in a suicide a felony. 
McNally held that Kevorkian committed no crime under state law. He said the 
question of criminality in assisting in a suicide is an issue for the 
Legislature. 
Michigan Gov.-elect John Engler, reacting to McNally's ruling, said he will 
push for legislation to outlaw helping a person commit suicide. He said he 
hopes the Legislature will act on such a measure early in the 1991 session. 
Thompson said he will prosecute any other similar cases that occur in Oakland 
County.
