FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Close vote on asylum changes
THE government narrowly avoided a fresh defeat last night on its
controversial attempt to change asylum and immigration laws.
Voting was 123 to 108 to reject an amendment to the Asylum and Immigration
Appeals Bill which would have undermined the tougher rules affecting
visitors, short-term and prospective students and their dependants.
