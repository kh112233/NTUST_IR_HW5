FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Pfizer costs taxation changes
PFIZER yesterday became the first US drugs company to quantify publicly the
cost of the Clinton tax changes on its business, saying its effective tax
rate would rise from an expected 26 per cent this year to 30 per cent in
1994.
Like other drugs companies, Pfizer manufactures many of its products in
Puerto Rico and so will be hit by a reduction in the tax relief on
operations located there.
The reduction in this relief, available under Section 936 of the US tax
code, makes the drugs industry one of the biggest losers from last week's
tax package.
Pfizer said that, although the effect of the tax change was unlikely to come
as a surprise, it was significant enough to warrant a statement. The
company's shares gained Dollars  1/2 to 59 5/8 by midday in New York.
Meanwhile, Abbott Laboratories, a US manufacturer of healthcare products,
said the tax changes would add Dollars 50m to its tax bill next year.
The company, which had net earnings last year of Dollars 1.2bn, said the
increase was due to the Section 936 change and the one percentage point
increase in the corporate tax rate.
It added, however, that a research and development tax credit would
partially offset the increase.
