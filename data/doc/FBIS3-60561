  AIDS -- ``The AIDS program manager in the Ministry of Health 
says there are 297 cases of AIDS in Lesotho. She, however, said 
this number does not reflect the exact figure of people with 
AIDS infection because many victims have not been medically 
examined.'' (Maseru Radio Lesotho in Eng 1130 GMT 17 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Mozambique </H5>
  HIV -- ``Sofala Province reported 80 HIV cases between 1986 
and March 1993. Dr. Inacio Barreto, provincial supervisor for 
AIDS, says the figure could be inaccurate due insufficient means 
of monitoring the spread of the virus.'' (Maputo Radio 
Mozambique Network in Portuguese 1400 GMT 17 Nov 93) 
<H5>  Namibia </H5>
  Polio -- The Ministry of Health and Social Service on 12 
November announced that ``a polio epidemic had broken out in 
Namibia, following eleven cases of Polio Myelitis reported to 
the Katutura Hospital.'' The 11 victims are children from 2 to 
4 years of age. They come from the Windhoek suburbs of 
Okuryangava, Wana-heda, Katutura, and Hochland Park, and from as 
far away as Keetmanshoop, Bethanie, Mariental, and Kalkrand. 
Five cases have been confirmed as having been caused by Polio 
type 1 wild strain virus,'' which ``descended from the West 
African Polio virus strain'' and was responsible for a polio 
outbreak in Nambibia in 1988.
