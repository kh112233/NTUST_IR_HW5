  [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to FRG Interior Minister 
Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union), the new asylum 
law, which has been in force since last July, has "decisively 
changed" the situation of asylum-seekers in Germany, At the 
same time, the new regulation has contributed to the 
preservation of internal peace in the FRG by having a 
"satisfying" effect "toward the inside and a clarifying" effect 
"toward the outside," Kanther stated on Wednesday [9 March] 
while presenting the first official balance sheet of the new 
asylum law. 
  In the report on recent experiences, which he presented to 
the Bundestag's Internal Affairs Committee, Kanther primarily 
pointed to the decline in the number of asylum-seekers last 
year: It went down from 224,000 during the first six months to 
98,500 during the second half of the year, thus experiencing a 
decline of 56 percent. The situation has clearly improved, 
particularly in the communities, the minister said. At the end 
of the year, one out of four beds in many reception facilities 
were no longer occupied, and it was possible to close many 
communal accommodations.
