FT  08 APR 93 / Letter: Schools must not perpetuate artificial educational
barrier
Sir, The secretary of state for education's decision to give a much higher
profile to vocational qualifications in recent weeks ('Patten vows to
improve the skills base', April 6) is particularly welcome given the implied
message within your own second leader of the same day ('Testing times').
While agreeing wholeheartedly that Mr Patten needs to talk to the teaching
profession about testing and about the national curriculum, I would take
issue with the assumptions behind your editorial's critique that it falls
into 'the twin traps of being insufficiently challenging for academic
children, while neglecting the basic skills others need for the world of
work'. Though intended to show the over-prescriptive nature of the national
curriculum, this illustration perpetuates an outmoded academic/vocational
division. Whatever flaws it has, a national school curriculum must seek,
surely, to stretch all children, not just the most academic? Equally it
should ensure that every child is equipped with at least some of the skills
needed for earning a living.
Implying that sufficient intellectual challenge is important for 'academic
children' while it is more necessary that 'others' should become skilled for
the world of work is not helpful to anyone. If the largely artificial
barrier between academic and vocational learning is being broken down in
higher education, it would be sad to see it maintained in schooling.
Without sharing the government's commitment to maintaining the A-level
system unchanged, it is possible to sympathise with Mr Patten's objective of
presenting people, whatever their age, with an attractive vocational option
that encourages more people to contribute to raising the country's skill
base. The alternative is to consign work-related learning to a second-best
ghetto area.
