ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 
BURGLARY SUSPECT DIES IN HOSPITAL 
A suspected burglar who was arrested with the help of a police dog died 
Thursday while being treated at a hospital, police said. 
Freddie Martinez Taffola, 36, of Santa Ana died of "unknown causes" about 3:30 
a.m. at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, Police Lt. Robert Helton said. 
A preliminary autopsy revealed that Taffola, who was "extremely violent" when 
police encountered him, tested positive for drugs. 
The autopsy also revealed no injuries that could have caused his death, Helton 
said. 
Taffola was arrested by police after they received several reports of a burglar 
prowling around a house on the 1300 block of West Saint Andrews Avenue. 
Police found Taffola on the grounds of nearby Sepulveda Elementary School when 
they went to investigate. When officers attempted to question Taffola, he 
became violent and had to be subdued, Helton said. A canine unit was called in 
to help in the arrest. 
At the hospital, Taffola lapsed into unconsciousness and died while being 
treated for dog bites and minor scrapes and bruises.
