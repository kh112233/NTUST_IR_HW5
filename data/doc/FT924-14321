FT  10 OCT 92 / German ministers at odds on violence
A MEETING of ministers responsible for justice and law enforcement in all
the federal states of Germany yesterday broke up in disarray after they
failed to agree on measures to combat the wave of violence against
foreigners.
While conservatives demanded tougher police powers of arrest and detention,
and new curbs on the right of asylum, their Social Democrat opponents called
instead for the existing laws to be more rigorously enforced.
The result was a failure to agree on any common action, in spite of
unanimous agreement over the threat of violence against foreigners from
roaming gangs of skinheads chanting neo-Nazi slogans.
The meeting of justice and interior ministers from the 16 federal states, as
well as from the central government, was summoned in the wake of a series of
attacks on asylum-seekers hostels in east Germany since the summer.
In the end, the political differences over the cause of the violence - the
influx of asylum-seekers and would-be immigrants, mostly from eastern and
southern Europe - left the ministers too divided to muster a common front.
The ministers from conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) and Christian
Social Union (CSU) states, backed by Mr Rudolf Seiters, the federal interior
minister, were calling for wider powers of arrest and detention for the
police, a redefinition of the crime of breach of the public peace, and
reinforcement of the Federal Bureau for Protection of the Constitution, the
office responsible for internal state security.
They also sought agreement on constitutional changes to limit the flow of
asylum-seekers. Angry SPD ministers refused to go along with wider police
powers, insisting that what was needed was proper enforcement of existing
legislation, but also accusing their rivals of playing party politics.
