FT  24 SEP 92 / Indonesia denies piracy link in ships' collision
INDONESIA has denied reports that pirates were involved in a collision last
weekend between an oil tanker and a container ship in the Strait of Malacca,
which divides the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the Malay peninsula.
The collision left one person dead, 29 missing and a huge oil slick in one
of the world's busiest shipping channels.
An Indonesian team yesterday boarded the Nagasaki Spirit, a 96,000 tonne
Liberian-registered tanker, and the Ocean Blessing, a Panamanian-registered
container ship.
Concern over the involvement of pirates followed the release by Orient
Overseas Container Line, the Hong Kong operators of the container, of their
captain's last radio message: 'We're being fired upon and have a fire on
board in several of the tanks. We're abandoning ship. No more time for
messages'.
Rear Admiral Yusuf Effendi, the Indonesian naval commander co-ordinating
rescue operations, has dismissed a link with piracy. He said the collision
occurred at the widest point of the strait where ships cruise at normal
speed, making it difficult for pirates to board. The channel, however, is
notorious for piracy, with more than 100 incidents in the first half of the
year.
Indonesia will refuse passage to a proposed shipment of about a tonne of
radioactive plutonium from France to Japan. Details of the shipment's timing
and route on board a Japanese vessel have not been released.
'We have clarification from the Japanese government that security steps
would be taken (to protect the shipment). . . but an accident may happen at
any time,' a foreign ministry spokesman said. However, the quickest route
for the shipment would be through the Strait of Malacca, to which Indonesia
cannot legally deny access.
