<F P=106> [Report on interview with Heide Simonis, minister-president </F>
of Schleswig-Holstein; place and date not given: "`Gasping Hard 
for Breath'"] 
  [Text] In May 1993, Heide Simonis was the first and 
so far only woman to become the head of a German land after 
predecessor Bjoern Engholm, 54, had relinquished all offices 
because of the Kiel "drawer affair." Simonis, a graduate 
economist, 50, made a name for herself as a fast and sassy 
talker ("every additional year of this Federal Government is an 
investment program in right extremism") as well as a budget 
expert, first in the Bundestag, then--from 1988 to 1993--as 
finance minister of Schleswig-Holstein. As chairman of the Wage 
Agreement Association of German Laender, OeTV [Trade Union for 
Public Services, Transportation, and Traffic] member Simonis ("I 
sit on the money like a brooding hen") was not afraid of 
conflict with the trade unions. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Frau Simonis, when you were elected as the 
first woman head of a land government nine months ago, you were 
afraid of a "special role like parsley on the male meat platter" 
of politics. So what are you now, a fresh leafy garnish or a 
satisfying side dish? 
  [Simonis] My male colleagues' fright has meanwhile abated. I 
don't think they consider me a garnish on their platter, nor as 
limp trimmings. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You are now among the string of SPD [Social 
Democratic Party] grandchildren. How do you feel on the team of 
your power-conscious male colleagues? 
  [Simonis] Since Grandpa is no longer on earth among the 
grandchildren, it is difficult to say who may rightfully call 
himself a grandson. Brandt also was never asked. For instance, 
it is pretty crazy to claim that Helmut Kohl is the grandson of 
Konrad Adenauer. What would the latter say to that. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Too much credit? 
  [Simonis] Perhaps no one of us is truly a Brandt grandchild. 
And strangely enough, we women are never even considered. 
Therefore, we don't even have a chance to stand in front of a 
mirror in the morning and ask: Am I not the fairest 
granddaughter of them all? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That sounds very modest. 
  [Simonis] No, I feel I am the fairest. But we women have to 
grapple more with the question: Is she even capable of that? Men 
are never asked such questions. People only look to see who is 
the nicest. How would it be if we would simply see ourselves as 
autonomous political beings? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Sometimes you are more in the headlines for 
extravagant hats or rings or earrings than for political ideas. 
Isn't that too little? 
  [Simonis] Much too little. It would also be interesting to 
talk about men's shirts, ties, underpants, or socks. But since 
this is evidently not ladylike, I avoid doing it. Despite all 
personal vanity, I find it a pity that my hats cause such a 
sensation. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] In the election to the SPD executive 
committee, 
you moved into the party leadership with the fourth-best result, 
far ahead of Gerhard Schroeder, for instance. Since then, the 
grass roots have hardly heard anything from you. 
  [Simonis] It is always a mistake to see election results as 
a 
starting signal for upheavals and radical changes. Let's wait 
and see, it is only beginning now. We are still conducting the 
election campaign. That does not necessarily enhance the 
capacity for conceptual thinking. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Social Democrats from the north now make 
headlines only with internal party trench warfare. Since the 
drawer affair with the resignations of Bjoern Engholm and 
Guenther Jansen, the Kiel SPD evidently no longer recognizes any 
friends. 
  [Simonis] There have been rejections, since the affair did 
not shake off those directly or indirectly concerned, like 
raindrops on a plastic raincoat. It irritated me in 1987 how 
quickly the SPD rose from one of the biggest political scandals 
of postwar days like a phoenix from the ashes. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Criticism of you personally is also growing. 
Your party caucus chairman, Gert Boernsen, never misses a chance 
to compromise you publicly. 
  [Simonis] Boernsen first of all does his job and tries to 
preserve the government party caucus majority of one. Since he 
knows that I am tough and can take it, he perhaps exaggerates 
somewhat. I find that quite nice, since I am always being 
accused of reacting too emotionally. So now I note with glee: 
Men do that, too. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Boernsen is not alone. There are several 
snipers on the loose within the SPD. 
  [Simonis] Sometimes I rather have the feeling that there are 
suicides loose among us. At present there is a disastrous urge 
among us not to talk to each other anymore. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] How much longer will you let the SPD and the 
Kiel government be damaged by internecine fighting? 
  [Simonis] First of all, I stand for the government, I draw a 
clear line of distinction. The government evidently works 
largely to the people's satisfaction. At least in an opinion 
poll not ordered by us, 65 percent stated they were very 
satisfied or satisfied with the government. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Only--no one identifies the minister-president 
with the SPD. 
  [Simonis] If that is true, we must indeed ask ourselves why 
that is so. Then the SPD would have to do a lot of catch-up work. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] For example? 
  [Simonis] We must admit mistakes, also in coping with the 
post-Barschel affair. We are not holier or cleverer than the 
others. I am afraid that no one understands anymore what we are 
doing at present in that investigative committee which is 
costing millions. If outsiders were to read the minutes, they 
would shake their heads and ask if we have nothing better to 
worry about. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] When will you follow the call of many voices 
and also assume the land chairmanship? 
  [Simonis] You mean, as a kind of super-Mommy of the 
frustrated party? That is a joke. The parties were to become 
more transparent through the very separation of offices, and now 
I am to suddenly take everything onto myself? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Because the other officeholders have failed. 
  [Simonis] When a man with a whip goes through the party 
which 
is half-way intact, then all scream: What's with this nonsense 
of running across the parade ground like a sergeant? In Willi 
Piecyk we now have a chairman who is considered too soft, and 
already they all say that he should yell a bit across the parade 
ground. The SPD must make up its mind about what it wants. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do you fear that the Barschel affair must be 
rewritten, at least in part? 
  [Simonis] It must not be rewritten. Unless the Federal 
Government actually has information which would justify the 
doubts about suicide. It remains the biggest political affair of 
postwar days which we, thanks to Barschel, have experienced in 
supposedly sleepy, amiable Schleswig-Holstein. And it was a 
mistake of the Social Democrats not to immediately admit openly 
when they learned for the first time about the machinations. 
This lie has burrowed into the SPD soul like a cancerous growth. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Formerly you were the chief negotiator of 
employers in public service. Federal Chancellor Kohl, and after 
him other community and land politicians, have committed 
themselves to a zero wage increase round for the public service 
sector. Rightfully so? 
  [Simonis] No. We will save ourselves to death with an 
absolute zero round when we consider consumption and economic 
upturn. This, my assessment, is meanwhile also supported by the 
scientific economic wise men. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] So the OeTV demand for a nominal purchase 
power 
adjustment is justified? 
  [Simonis] A zero-zero round without any social component 
would be unjust and fundamentally wrong, at least for the lower 
income groups where families are left with barely 1,600 German 
marks, especially since others with high incomes and a 
relatively high savings ratio get more, at least through 
interest income. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What could a social differentiation look like? 
  [Simonis] How would it be to make a noticeable distinction 
between the incomes of those down there and those up there and 
to simply add nothing further as of a certain salary level? Or 
to be a bit more generous with employees with children, and in 
turn cut the vacation allowance for higher grades? 
  [DER SPIEGEL] But with wage agreements at the expense of the 
higher grades and higher incomes, you will anger a clientele 
which you urgently need in the election. 
  [Simonis] If this clientele does not comprehend that it is 
sawing off the branch on which it sits, then it is its own 
fault. For it must understand that it cannot preserve its 
prosperity at the expense of those earning less. Whoever lies to 
the people now must still tell them the truth afterward. Hence 
it is the task of a large people's party to ultimately reunite 
the now divergent groups. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That is particularly hard for the SPD. Oskar 
Lafontaine contributes to the insecurity by freely advocating 
social reductions. 
  [Simonis] We must examine the possibilities for savings at 
all population levels and take a close look where social abuse 
shows up. I know that the tax collector's office is being 
cheated by upper-crust people, and that amounts to more than the 
fraud at social welfare offices. But I also don't think it's 
right that someone gets up at four in the morning to weld cast 
iron plates at the shipyard in rain and snow, while others lie 
at home in bed and do nothing at all. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] That was not precisely what Lafontaine had in 
mind when he advocated further social hardships through more 
flexible and longer working hours, for instance. 
  [Simonis] The voters sometimes will still have to gasp for 
air if we want to get the economy going again. For instance, in 
Schleswig-Holstein we will have to tell them that subsidized 
rents for some will rise. We want to give support on a more 
income-dependent basis. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Is the SPD even in touch still with the 
worries 
and feelings of people? 
  [Simonis] This criticism does an injustice to Rudolf 
Scharping, for example. It may be true that the SPD chairman 
lacks glamor. But he is not to run as a beauty contestantant; he 
is to make the party electable. So he concentrates on the 
essential program points: fighting unemployment, stimulating the 
economy, and social justice. And he is right on target. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And that makes the SPD capable of a majority? 
  [Simonis] At the moment we must leave some of our favorite 
subjects relatively unattended. To the accusation from the 
rather Green spectrum, that we no longer have any vision, 
unfortunately I can only say: At the moment, the greatest vision 
we can have is to prevent our land from sliding into right 
radicalism. We must create the social basis for that purpose. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] After the September election in Hamburg, you 
scared your party friends with the vision of a Red-Green 
coalition, which could also apply to Bonn. 
  [Simonis] We are always accused of not clearly stating our 
position. So I took an unequivocal position once, and that also 
was not considered right. For this reason I ruefully offered an 
apology. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Now no one dares approach the subject. 
  [Simonis] Because we are so busy trying to win. Whoever at 
present thinks about coalitions, is wasting his energy. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] The voters would like to know with whom the 
SPD 
intends to govern. 
  [Simonis] Then they should vote accordingly. And then we'll 
see. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Frau Simonis, we thank you for talking to us.
