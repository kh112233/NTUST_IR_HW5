ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH 
OSLO-BOUND: Ronald Jue of Fullerton has visited the Dalai Lama in India and 
heads the foundation that was sponsoring his Orange County visit when the Dalai 
Lama received word in October that he'd won the Nobel Peace Prize. . . . Now, 
when the Dalai Lama receives the prize Dec. 10 in Oslo, Jue will be among the 
80 people from around the world on the holy man's guest list. . . . A spokesman 
for Jue's Newport Beach-based East-West Foundation said Jue will make the trip
