  [Text] Riga, Mar 07, BNS -- The Latvian National Bank 
plans to keep its eyes peeled on the money supply to avert price 
hike and cut inflation to 10 percent in 1994, the bank's 
President Einars Repse said Saturday [5 March]. 
  In 1993, the inflation ran a comparatively low 34.9 percent, 
Repse told the economic development seminar at the Economics 
Ministry. In Estonia, prices increased 35 percent, in Lithuania 
288 percent, in Russia 1,000 percent and in Belarus 1,060 
percent. 
  Only some of East European countries, like the Czech 
Republic 
(18 percent) and Slovakia (23 percent), reported lower inflation 
rate than Latvia last year, Repse said. 
  The Bank of Latvia's main short-term goals are stabilizing 
of 
prices and currency, and raising credibility in the national 
currency, the lat, said Repse. 
  Latvia managed to stop the decline in its gross domestic 
product in 1993, Repse noted. 
  The central bank is aware of the negative impact of the 
national currency revaluation on the export opportunities, said 
Repse. It preserved a stable currency market by preventing 
sharp increase and fluctuations in the lat rate. 
  The measures helped the Baltic country to lead its foreign 
trade balance back in the black, Repse said. 
  On the other hand, Repse conceded that the economy reacts 
inflexibly to changes in currency rates. The chances of market 
relations are not fully used in Latvia yet, he added. 
  Commenting on the influx of convertible currencies into 
Latvia, Repse said that the acquired reserves would allow to 
avoid sharp fluctuations in the lat rate and grant some safety 
to the national currency in the future.
