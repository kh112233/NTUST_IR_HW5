  [Text] The Fiji Parliament has passed the bill aimed at 
preventing possible terrorist attacks in Fiji aviation industry. 
The bill led by the tourism and aviation minister, Harold 
Powell, provides for life imprisonment as a maximum sentence for 
people convicted of hijacking, sabotaging, or endangering an 
aircraft. 
  Mr. Powell said the bill was important because it is in line 
with international aviation agreements and protocol. The laws 
would allow Fiji to be prepared to deal with crimes conducted in 
each aviation circuit and deter would-be fugitives wanted for 
aviation crime from taking refuge in Fiji. Mr. Powell said, 
under the new law, Fiji would have the legal grounds to force 
airlines using Fiji's airports to have a strict security system. 
Opposition leader Jairam Reddy said the bill was long overdue 
and he had no hesitation in supporting it.
