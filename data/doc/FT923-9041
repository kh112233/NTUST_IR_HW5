FT  07 AUG 92 / Olympic News in Brief: US hammer thrower faces four-year ban
American hammer thrower Jud Logan was thrown out of the Olympics after he
became the first US athlete in 16 years to fail a drug test at the Games.
The International Olympic Committee said earlier that Logan had tested
positive for Clenbuterol, a banned anabolic-type drug.
Logan, 33, said he used Clenbuterol until last February but stopped using it
when he learned it was banned.
The International Amateur Athletic Federation must decide whether to impose
sanctions on Logan. IAAF rules state that athletes testing positive for
anabolic steroids face an automatic four-year suspension.
The IOC has already announced that women's marathoner Madina Biktagirova of
the Unified Team tested positive for the banned stimulant norephedrine.
Biktagirova, 27, who finished fourth, returned home before the test result
was made public. The first competitor to be disqualified was Wu Dan, a
female volleyball player from China who tested positive for the stimulant
strychnine.
