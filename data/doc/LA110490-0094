SURROGATE CASE DRAWS FIRE FROM THOSE SICK AT HEART, SICK OF SUITS 
When Anna Johnson went to court to obtain parental rights to the baby she was 
carrying for the Calverts, she burned her bridges to any type of relationship 
with the child. 
If Ms. Johnson had spent more time "nurturing" a relationship with the Calverts 
rather than slapping them in the face with a lawsuit, the Calverts may have 
come to feel a closeness to Anna and would have welcomed her as a special 
person in their child's life.
