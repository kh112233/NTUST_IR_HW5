FT  14 DEC 93 / Gaidar calls for anti-fascist front: Russia's reformists
suffer severe setback as far right makes sweeping election gains
Russia's reformist parties, shocked by the sweeping gains in Sunday's
elections by the neo-fascist Liberal Democrats, begin urgent talks today on
forming an 'anti-fascist front' to save reforms.
Early results from far eastern regions and estimates from European Russia
last night showed Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's neo-fascist Liberal Democrats
with a commanding lead. Mr Gaidar's Russia's Choice came second in some
regions and, in others, third behind the communists.
Although voting in European Russia may redress the balance somewhat, early
indications of a surge in support for Mr Zhirinovsky have been more than
confirmed.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister and leader of Russia's Choice,
the main reformist bloc, said the 'widest democratic coalition' was
necessary 'to influence changes in the government which must take place in
the next few days'.
He said: 'It would be a danger to all of humanity if there was the slightest
chance of this man (Zhirinovsky) becoming president.' Even communists, he
said, would be welcome to join a coalition.
He called for reforms to continue to stop the extremist bandwagon - and said
he was 'confident' that the democrats could muster a majority in the new
parliament, due to convene on January 11.
If he proves wrong, the pace of reform will rest entirely with President
Boris Yeltsin, who has been given the power by the new constitution to form
the government and dissolve parliamentif it disagrees with his choice.
Mr Yeltsin's aides said that the constitution had been approved by about 60
per cent of the electorate.
Mr Gaidar's warning reverberated through former Soviet republics, territory
Mr Zhirinovsky has threatened to occupy. The Baltic states announced they
will hold a summit tomorrow to discuss the result.
In Washington, President Clinton said he was pleased at Russia's adoption of
a new constitution and 'not particularly surprised' at the strong showing of
ultra-nationalists.
The German government congratulated 'the Russian people and President Boris
Yeltsin on the good result for the new constitution' although there was
concern over the big vote for both nationalists and communists.
Mr Yeltsin issued a statement saying that the elections had 'established the
conditions for an honourable and democratic expression of the will of
Russian citizens'.
He greeted the adoption of the constitution as the basis for 'our common
hope in the resurrection of a great and strong Russia'. He pledged that 'as
president I will stand strongly on the basis of the new constitution, so
that, relying on your constitutional choice, I will do all I can to
guarantee the irreversibility of the democratic processes, to put a
constitutional barrier for all citizens against a reversal of your
democratic choice'.
Earlier, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's press secretary, had suggested
that Mr Yeltsin was prepared to work with the Liberal Democrats - saying
that they had a common interest in social protection, patriotism and the
revival of Russia.
Mr Zhirinovsky said: 'If Yeltsin asks us to form a government, we are ready.
If he asks us to join the government, take up two-three ministerial
positions, we are ready. If he offers us nothing, we are ready to remain as
the largest opposition party and help constructively.'
He appeared anxious to moderate his previous hard-line positions - even
going to the length of denying previous statements that he intended to
repossess Finland.
Mr Zhirinovsky's success is bolstered by the election of such leading
conservative figures as Mr Sergei Baburin, former leader of the Unity
nationalist bloc in the former parliament, standing in Omsk; and Mr Anatoly
Lukyanov, former speaker of the Soviet-era parliament jailed for allegedly
taking part in the coup attempt against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991,
standing in Smolensk.
