FT  09 DEC 94 / Falkland fishing rights talks stall
Talks between Britain and Argentina over fishing rights around the disputed
Falkland islands have temporarily broken down after the two sides failed to
agree on catch quotas.
Although a joint official statement maintained that talks held in Buenos
Aires had been 'cordial', the two sides remain far apart. Argentina, which
still claims sovereignty over the South Atlantic islands despite its defeat
by Britain in the 1982 Falklands conflict, has previously co-operated over
the setting of fishing limits.
Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentina's deputy foreign minister, yesterday denied
reports that Buenos Aires had unilaterally declared a quota of 220,000
tonnes, but confirmed it 'believes there is no problem aiming for the
maximum catch possible'.
He said scientific reports indicated that levels of fish around the islands
were such that there was no need to repeat last year's bilateral agreement,
in which the Argentines and Falkland islanders agreed to limit their catch
as 'the resource was becoming scanty'.
The British government is likely to consider provocative a statement by Mr
Guido di Tella, foreign minister, late on Wednesday night. He said: 'Last
year we did not catch (our full quota of) 220,000 tonnes, but this year we
will do so because our scientific information indicates that this will not
affect the biomass.'
Both governments are insisting talks will be reconvened before the fishing
season begins early next year.
