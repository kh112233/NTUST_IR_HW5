  [Text] Jakarta, Jun 22 (OANA/ANTARA) -- State/Minister 
Secretary Murdiono stressed here Wednesday that the government 
will hold on to its policy of openness including the media 
although it revoked on Tuesday publishing licences of three 
major Jakarta weeklies. 
  "The press community would have no problems if they only 
know 
how to abide by the country's journalism code of ethics (KEJ) 
and other existing regulations. 
  "Follow the KEJ and there would be no problems," Murdiono 
said.
