  [Text] Madrid, 1 Jun (EFE) -- Four shots fired by a man and 
woman ended the life Army Brigadier General Juan Jose Hernandez 
Rovira, the victim of a terrorist attack carried out today in 
Madrid. 
  The attack took place at 0845 (0645 GMT) as the general was 
leaving his home, located in a Salamanca neighborhood in the 
center of Madrid. A resident of a building near the site of the 
attack told EFE the general, the father of six children, lost 
his wife last year. Municipal police sources told EFE that 
after the shooting the general, who was still alive, was taken 
to a hospital but died on arrival. 
  The ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] terrorist group 
carried out the most recent attack in Madrid, on 23 May. In 
that incident, an engineer lieutenant was killed by a car bomb 
explosion. On Sunday in the northern Basque country, three 
persons were wounded when bombs concealed in two purses 
exploded. The Vizcaya Civil Government attributed that attack 
to ETA.
