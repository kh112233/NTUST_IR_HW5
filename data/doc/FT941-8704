FT  18 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Milk-based product fights
rotavirus
One of the world's biggest killers of young children, rotavirus
gastroenteritis, could itself be under threat, with the help of the common
dairy cow.
Scientists in Adelaide, South Australia, have devised a milk-based product
which gives children immunity from the rotavirus by preventing it from
invading the lining cells of the gut, the cause of diarrhoea.
The potion, called Gastrogard, is made by injecting cows with a special
vaccine prior to calving. When the cow then produces, colostrum, the
super-rich milk made after birth, it contains antibodies against the
rotavirus. When administered to children, the antibodies bind to the
rotavirus.
Although presenting most danger to children in third world countries, the
rotavirus is also a problem in children's hospitals and care centres.
Production of the Gastrogard powder will begin next year at the South
Australian Research and Development Institute.
