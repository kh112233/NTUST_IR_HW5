FT  30 JUL 93 / AZT 'effective on Aids'
AZT, the controversial treatment for the Aids-causing virus, HIV, is
effective in slowing progression to Aids, according to a large-scale study
published yesterday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
The study appears to contradict another trial, the Anglo-French Concorde
study published earlier this year, which called into question the
effectiveness of the drug in HIV-positive patients who had not developed the
disease.
AZT, also known as Retrovir, and manufactured by the UK pharmaceuticals
group Wellcome, remains the only treatment licensed for HIV-positive
patients without symptoms.
The new trial compared the drug with a placebo on 993 asymptomatic patients
for an average of two and a half years in Australia and Europe. All patients
had a CD4 cell count - a measurement of the immune system's strength - of
above 400. A normal level is more than 1,000.
The trial showed that, compared with those on the placebo, the CD4 counts of
those on AZT were half as likely to develop Aids or Aids-related diseases or
to suffer a deterioration in CD4 cell counts below 350.
In an editorial about the most recent trial, The New England Journal of
Medicine concluded: 'The results show a statistically significant advantage
with early therapy and good tolerance of zidovudine (AZT). . . The
implication is that most patients should be treated, but the benefit may be
greatest if therapy is begun when CD4 cell counts are over 300 to 400.'
The Concorde study took a broad range of asymptomatic patients, many of whom
had CD4 cell counts well below 400 and some as low as 200. It may be that
AZT is less effective in such patients.
The new trial supports earlier studies suggesting AZT is effective and
contradicts the Concorde programme. Wellcome has maintained the preliminary
conclusions of the Concorde trial, the full results of which have yet to be
published, suffered from statistical problems.
