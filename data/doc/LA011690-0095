METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWSUIT DROPPED IN MAN'S JAIL CELL DEATH 
Relatives of a construction worker who was found hanged in his Torrance jail 
cell in 1988 have dropped their highly publicized lawsuit against the city. 
Paper work requesting dismissal of the case was filed in Torrance Superior 
Court last week, ending a lengthy battle by 27-year-old Timothy McCauley's 
family to prove that he did not commit suicide. 
City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said the dismissal came after the city agreed not to 
seek legal costs from the family. "I think they realized there really was no 
case there," Nelson said. 
McCauley's father, Donald, insisted in a brief telephone interview that the 
case did have merit, but declined to comment on why he had decided not to 
pursue it further. 
McCauley was found dead in his cell the day after his arrest for traffic 
violations and fleeing. A sling he'd been given for a shoulder injury was 
around his neck.
