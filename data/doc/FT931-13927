FT  21 JAN 93 / GPs worried over proposed prescription restrictions
UP TO 80 per cent of general practitioners believe government plans to limit
further the range of drugs they can prescribe will lead to a deterioration
in care for National Health Service patients, according to a poll of 200
GPs. The survey for the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry
by Milpro, a division of MAI, also found that two thirds of GPS are opposed
to the proposals.
