for Operation of the Glass Melter Thermal Treatment Unit at the

ACTION:

 Proposed Finding of No Significant Impact. 






</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has prepared an environmental assessment (DOE/EA0821) for the proposed
operation of the Glass Melter thermal treatment unit (``Glass Melter'') at DOE's Mound Plant in Miamisburg, Ohio.
The Glass Melter would thermally treat mixed waste (hazardous waste contaminated with radioactive constituents,
largely tritium, plutonium-238, and/or thorium-230) that was generated at the Mound Plant and is now in storage by
stabilizing the waste in glass blocks. Depending upon the radiation level of the waste, the Glass Melter may operate
for as short a time as one year, but not longer than six years. DOE considered two onsite alternatives to the proposed
action and seven offsite alternatives. 





Based on the analysis presented in the environmental assessment, DOE believes that the proposed action does not constitute
a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 

et seq.

 Therefore, DOE proposes to issue a finding of no significant impact. This proposed finding of no significant impact
is being made available for public review. DOE will consider any 

comments received in making a final determination on whether to issue a finding of no 

significant impact or to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed operation of the Mound Plant
glass melter thermal treatment unit. 



</SUMMARY>
<DATE>
DATES:

 Comments on the proposed finding of no significant impact should be postmarked by December 5, 1994 to assure consideration.
Comments postmarked after that date will be considered to the extent practicable.
