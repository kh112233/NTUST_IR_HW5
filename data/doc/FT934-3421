FT  09 DEC 93 / New post for Winnie Mandela
Mrs Winnie Mandela made a triumphant return to the top level of the African
National Congress yesterday when the ANC Women's League elected her as its
president, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
Mrs Mandela, the estranged wife of ANC President Nelson Mandela, in May 1991
was sentenced to six years in jail for kidnapping and assault but an appeal
court later reduced the sentence to a fine and a suspended jail term.
