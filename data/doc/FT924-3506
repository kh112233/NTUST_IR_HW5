FT  08 DEC 92 / Daimler-Benz appeals for tolerance
DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's biggest industrial concern, has appealed publicly to
its workforce to show tolerance and solidarity in the face of rising racist
violence.
An open letter from Mr Edzard Reuter, group chairman, released before
publication in 30 German newspapers tomorrow, said 'criminal fanatics' who
did not shrink from murder challenged German self-respect.
'Irrationality and violence must not be allowed to take hold at a time when
the signs point to crisis and we are feeling the full weight of worldwide
recession,' it said. The fight against intolerance had to start with
improved communications in the workplace - the first point of contact
between Germans and foreigners.
Non-Germans make up more than a quarter of Daimler's 390,000 worldwide
workforce.
The group employs 40,000 foreigners inside Germany. Publication of the
letter, which will reinforce a campaign within the business community
against xenophobia, reflects concern both at the two-year wave of violence
and at indications that international revulsion could damage German business
interests.
Xenophobic violence has been growing since a mob fire-bombed a refugee
hostel in Hoyerswerda, Saxony, two years ago.
Lufthansa, the state-owned airline, ran press advertisements last weekend
stressing the international nature of the group. 'We are foreigners every
day,' the copy said.
Preussag, the steel and engineering group, last week declared that those who
wanted a future must be internationally minded, and not just at holiday
time.
All the corporate protests have stressed the contributions made to economic
well-being by foreign workers.
