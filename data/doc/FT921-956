FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A market by any other name / A look at Robin
Cook's plans for the health service
MR William Waldegrave, health secretary, often points out that versions of
the government's health reforms are being introduced worldwide.
His point is correct but it brings him little political comfort. Since many
British voters have only the flimsiest understanding of the detail of the
year-old reforms, the fact that politicians and health care professionals
are pondering similar solutions to common problems in Sweden, the
Netherlands, Israel or New Zealand is not going to win the health debate.
It would, however, impose some difficult decisions on an incoming Labour
government. Labour is fighting the election pledged to scrap the reforms.
Given the zeal with which the party has opposed them, any other position
might have bewildered its candidates and voters alike. However, the main
question in the minds of National Health Service professionals is whether
abolition of the reforms would necessarily lead to the market-like structure
on which they are founded being dismantled.
The big health care issue is much the same throughout the developed world.
Essentially it involves finding ways of controlling rapid cost increases in
the face of even more rapidly growing demand driven by higher public
expectations, technological advance and the expensive treatment required by
an ageing population.
Governments of all political persuasions are trying to force more efficiency
out of their health delivery systems. The separation of the purchase of
health care from its provision - the centrepiece of the government's reforms
 -is a fashionable notion at the heart of many attempts to do this.
Labour will certainly speedily abolish the more controversial specific
aspects of the government's changes, notably self-governing trust hospitals
and GP fund-holders.
On the purchaser-provider split, Labour's manifesto says it would create a
'modern, efficient NHS with incentives to improve performance - but without
the queue-jumping and waste created by a market in health care'. It would
hope to do this through performance agreements between health authorities
and hospitals, with additional incentive funds for institutions which
performed above target.
Call it a market or not, there is still a glimpse of competition - there
would be winners and losers in the bid for extra funds.
Some health care specialists do not think this model would create
sufficiently robust separation between purchaser and provider to create
efficiency improvements. Professor Chris Ham, of Birmingham University's
health service management centre and the King's Fund college, believes that
retention of trust hospitals is needed to stimulate true bargaining between
managers.
This view is not universally shared. There is a trend in bureaucracies -
among which the NHS is world-class - towards devolved decision-making. Many
local authorities and other public bodies are introducing versions of
internal markets, with individual departments having to sell services to
each other.
If this managerial atmosphere survived a Tory defeat, it is possible Labour
could retain the principle of the reforms while claiming it had eradicated
the government's 'commercial market'.
On spending, an incoming Labour health secretary would do well to keep pace
with the relatively generous settlements that Conservative predecessors have
won from the Treasury in the last three years. The Labour pledge to spend an
extra Pounds 1bn over the next 22 months has to be viewed in the context of
the service's Pounds 36bn budget for 1992-93: Pounds 1bn is a handy sum of
money, it is not a passport to transformation.
The long political process leading to the government's health reforms and
this year's general election clash over the future of the health service
began in 1988 with claims that the service was structurally underfunded -
Britain spends less of its GDP on health care than most developed nations.
Labour acknowledges that it may take at least the lifetime of a parliament
to tackle what it regards as a decade of Conservative party underfunding.
But all political parties know that, regardless of economic constraints, any
attempt to reach a 'correct' level of health care funding is a
struggle-unto-death with a moving target as demands keep rising. Arguments
over waiting lists make for good political exchanges, but waiting lists are
the way in which the NHS rations finite resources.
One of the most interesting aspects of Labour's plans is its enthusiasm for
promoting healthier lifestyles. Health promotion used to be regarded, even
among many health care professionals, as a fringe issue compared with the
real business of giving people expensive treatment in hospital. Now health
care systems throughout the world, in the the face of cost pressures, are
showing growing interest in prevention being better than cure.
