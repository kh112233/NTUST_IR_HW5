FT  26 JUN 93 / Bonn threatens deportation of Kurd separatists
TURKS and Kurds clashed in the streets of Germany yesterday, prompting
officials to threaten deportation as a way to prevent Kurdish separatists
from importing their war to German soil. Turks and Kurds, who have lived
side by side for decades, expressed concern that Thursday's attacks by
Kurdish militants in 16 German cities could inflame anti-foreigner sentiment
and set back their campaign for more civil rights and protection from
neo-Nazi extremists.
Meanwhile the German government yesterday promised tougher security for
Turkish property after harsh criticism from Ankara that they had failed to
protect Turkish targets from a wave of attacks by Kurdish separatists. The
militant Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) claimed responsibility for the
attacks on Turkish missions, banks and travel agencies across western
Europe, and for holding hostages for 14 hours in the Turkish consulate in
Munich.
