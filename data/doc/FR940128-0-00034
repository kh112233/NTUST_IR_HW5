 Final rule.

<SUMMARY>
SUMMARY:

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its general labeling policy for over-the-counter (OTC) drug products
to allow for the interchangeable use of certain words in labeling required by an OTC drug monograph. Examples of these
words include: ``doctor'' and ``physician,'' ``consult'' and ``ask,'' and ``indications'' and ``uses.'' This
final rule provides alternate terminology in the labeling of OTC drug products for words that have the same meaning.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 In the 

Federal Register

 of April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17553), the agency proposed to amend its general labeling policy for over-the-counter (OTC)
drug products to allow for the interchangeable use of certain words in the labeling required by an OTC drug monograph.
The agency had previously proposed in a number of tentative final monographs and included in a number of final monographs
a provision that the words ``doctor'' and ``physician'' may be used interchangeably in the labeling of OTC drug products.
(See, e.g., 333.150(e), 333.350(e), and 336.50(e) (21 CFR 333.150(e), 333.350(e), and 336.50(e)).)
Instead of including this provision in each OTC drug monograph, the agency proposed to include such a provision in
330.1 (21 CFR 330.1) as part of the general conditions under which an OTC drug is generally recognized as safe,
effective, and not misbranded. The agency also proposed that, at manufacturers' discretion, the word ``ask'' could
be substituted for the word ``consult,'' which appears in the directions for many OTC drug monograph ingredients.
(See, e.g., 333.150(c)(1), 333.350(c)(2), and 340.50(c)(2) (21 CFR 340.50(c)(2)).) Thus, the agency
proposed that the phrases ``consult a physician,'' ``consult a doctor,'' ``ask a physician,'' and ``ask a doctor''
could be used interchangeably. The agency invited comments and suggestions as to such other terms that could be used
interchangeably, i.e., terms general in nature that appear in more than one OTC drug monograph.


One trade association, representing OTC drug manufacturers, and one drug manufacturer submitted comments in response
to the agency's proposal. Copies of the comments are on display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA305),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 123, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, and may be seen by interested
persons between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.


I. Summary of the Comments Received


The comment from the trade association agreed with the agency's proposal to allow for the interchangeable use of the
words ``doctor'' and ``physician,'' and the words ``consult'' and ``ask.'' The comment suggested the following
additional sets of alternative terms and gave the following citations, showing inclusion in several OTC drug monographs,
as support: (1) ``Clean'' or ``cleanse'' (333.150(d), 333.350(d)(1), and 346.50(d)(1) (21 CFR 346.50(d)(1)));
(2) ``persist'' or ``continue'' (341.76(c)(5)(ii), 346.50(c)(7)(iii), 357.150(c)(1), and 357.850(c)(1)(i)
(21 CFR 341.76(c)(5)(ii), 346.50(c)(7)(iii), 357.150(c)(1), and 357.850(c)(1)(i))); (3) ``chronic'' or ``persistent''
(336.50(c)(1), 338.50(c)(3), 341.74(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii) through (c)(4)(iv), and 341.78(c)(1)
(21 CFR 338.50(c)(3), 341.74(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii) through (c)(4)(iv), and 341.78(c)(1))); (4) ``assistance''
or ``help'' (331.30(g), 332.30(c), 341.74(f), and 342.76(c)(5)(i) and (c)(6)(ii) (21 CFR 331.30(g),
332.30(c), 341.74(f), and 342.76(c)(5)(i) and (c)(6)(ii))); and (5) ``pulmonary'' or ``lung'' (336.50(c)(1)
and 338.50(c)(3)). The comment stated that, in some instances, the paired terms already appear in the cited regulations
and, in other cases, the alternative terms may be better understood by consumers. The comment mentioned the following
examples: ``Lung'' disease may be better understood than the more technical ``pulmonary'' disease, and ``persistent''
may be better understood than ``chronic.'' The comment stated its understanding that the rule is intended only to
provide a glossary of comparable terms that may be used interchangeably, not to make substantive changes in the underlying
required label statements. For example, the comment mentioned that the rule would not permit the term ``health professional''
as an alternative to the terms ``doctor'' or ``physician,'' because a ``health professional'' may include pharmacists,
nurses, midwives, and others who are not licensed to practice medicine. The comment requested that the agency clarify
that this rule applies only to OTC drug monograph language otherwise required to be declared verbatim in OTC drug product
labeling. The comment added that the rule would not apply to or otherwise affect the use of truthful and nonmisleading
alternative terms that can be used for monograph indications. 
The other comment also proposed that the terms ``assistance'' and ``help'' be allowed interchangeably in the general
overdose warning, which states: ``In case of accidental ingestion, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison
Control Center immediately.'' 


II. The Agency's Final Conclusions


The agency has carefully evaluated the comments' proposals for the interchangeable use of certain terms and concludes
that the interchangeable terms suggested by the comments (``clean'' or ``cleanse,'' ``persist(s)'' or ``continue(s),''
``assistance'' or ``help,'' and ``pulmonary'' or ``lung'') are acceptable and will help promote better label readability.

In addition, the agency has determined that the terms ``indication(s)'' or ``use(s)'' should be allowed to be used
interchangeably. The agency considers the term ``use(s)'' to be simpler and better understood by consumers than
the term ``indication(s).'' The agency is including this option in 330.1(i).
The agency disagrees with the interchangeable use of the words ``chronic'' and ``persistent.'' ``Chronic,'' by
definition, is of long duration, or may be subject to habit or disease for a lengthy period (Ref. 1). On the other hand,
``persistent,'' by definition, is refusing to let go, insistently repetitive or continuous, or enduring (Ref. 2).
While ``chronic'' is also ``persistent,'' ``persistent'' is not necessarily ``chronic.'' For instance, a chronic
cough denotes one that has gone on for a lengthy period of time, while a persistent cough could be one of recent onset
that does not respond to treatment. Thus, a chronic cough and a persistent cough may be the same, or they could be two
separate entities. Therefore, interchangeable use of the terms ``chronic'' and ``persistent'' is not included
in the final rule.

This final rule does not make substantive changes in the language required in OTC drug monographs. The rule allows
for alternative terminology for certain terms that are sufficiently comparable to be used interchangeably. The
rule does not affect the use of truthful and nonmisleading terminology as an alternative to monograph indications
in accord with 330.1(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(2)(iii).
The agency has examined the economic consequences of this final rule and determined that it does not require either
a regulatory impact analysis, as specified in Executive Order 12866, or a regulatory flexibility analysis, as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96354). This final rule provides alternative labeling options
that can be implemented at very little cost by manufacturers at the next printing of labels, for those products for
which the manufacturer chooses to make a change. Thus, the rule will have no significant economic impact. The agency
concludes that the final rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies
that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the
Regulatory Flexibility Act.
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
