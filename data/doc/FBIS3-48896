  [Text] Speaking to newsmen at the Sukarno-Hatta 
International Airport on his return from a three-day visit to 
Yemen yesterday, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas expressed his 
opinion that the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem could probably be 
settled through the Nonalignment Movement, NAM and the Islamic 
Organization Conference, ICO, because of the larger number of 
countries involved in the issue. Minister Ali Alatas was 
optimistic that if a conference was hosted by the Nonalignment 
Movement and ICO, there was a hope that peace would be restored 
to Bosnia when compared to the unilateral conferences held in 
Geneva. 
  According to the minister, a long series of conferences had 
already been held and Bosnia is concerned over the 
responsibility and attitude of the United Nations Security 
Council.
