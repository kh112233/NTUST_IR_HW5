  [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The German Government intends 
to allow refugees from the civil war in Rwanda to enter Germany 
on an individual basis. This assurance was given by the Foreign 
Ministry in Bonn today after the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU newspaper 
had attacked the entry ban that has been applied so far. This 
also affects the family of the former Rwandan ambassador to Bonn. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the new ruling was 
currently being agreed with the national and regional Interior 
Ministries. Entry will always require approval from the 
competent Interior Ministry and the German aliens' authority. 
It will have to be examined whether the visa payment could be 
dropped for the Rwandan refugees. "There is room for maneuver 
there," the spokesman stressed. 
  The Foreign Ministry, headed by Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel, had initially said it was not responsible for the 
question of the entry ban on the civil war refugees. It said 
that the regional interior ministers alone were responsible for 
deciding on entry and residence matters. The national Interior 
Ministry rejected this sweeping statement. An Interior Ministry 
spokesman said the Foreign Ministry was able to issue visas for 
each individual case. [passage omitted]
