TEXAS REPORTER JAILED FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT 
A reporter who was found in contempt of court spent Saturday behind bars, and 
her newspaper tried to free the journalist from a jail term imposed because she 
would not answer questions in a capital murder case. 
State District Judge Eric Brown, who had performed Libby Averyt's marriage 
ceremony only a month earlier, on Friday had the Caller-Times reporter 
handcuffed and jailed for refusing to answer questions about her interview with 
a capital murder suspect.
