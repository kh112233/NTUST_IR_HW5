FT  10 JUL 93 / Piech asserts his authority at VW
MR Ferdinand Piech, Volkswagen chairman, yesterday publicly warned his
former vice-chairman not to speak out of turn and reasserted his authority
over his turbulent production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua.
He also warned Mr Louis Hughes, chairman of General Motors Europe, that he
was doomed to lose his legal campaign against the German vehicle maker.
Last week's abrupt resignation of his deputy, Mr Daniel Goeudevert, was
mutually agreed, he said in an interview with Die Welt newspaper. Cuts at
the top level, part of a DM8bn (Pounds 3.1bn) economy drive, would reduce
management board costs by 30 per cent.
An arrangement under which Mr Goeudevert, formerly in charge of the VW
marque, was staying on as an 'adviser' was not an attempt to muzzle him, Mr
Piech insisted. 'But should Mr Goeudevert speak publicly about internal
matters, that would naturally have an inevitable influence on our further
co-operation,' he said.
Mr Piech quashed speculation - fuelled by Mr Lopez - that VW would shortly
start production in a new super-lean plant in the Basque country. It was
'out of the question at this time. . . I have told Mr Lopez this,' he said.
Addressing the legal investigations initiated by GM, Mr Lopez's former
employer, into suspicions of industrial espionage, Mr Piech said it was
'exclusively a personal campaign' by the Zuricher. (Mr Hughes, former head
of Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, is now based in Zurich.)
Mr Hughes had applied for the top job at VW, he claimed. He was not
'wounded' when he did not get it, but the legal attacks came when he lost Mr
Lopez to VW. 'General Motors is the last company where we could find
anything of use to us,' he commented.
Repeating that VW would break even this year after losses in the first
quarter, Mr Piech said 90 per cent of planned restructuring had already been
instituted.
