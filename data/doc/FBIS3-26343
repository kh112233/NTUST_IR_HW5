  [Text] A human rights group says China has sentenced 11 
Tibetan Buddhist nuns to between two and seven years in prison. 
Amnesty International says the nuns were arrested last June and 
jailed for allegedly taking part in an anti-Chinese 
demonstration. 
  Amnesty urged concerned people to write to the Tibetan 
Regional Government, asking for clarification of the case. Last 
month, another human rights group, the Tibet Information 
Network, said the Chinese authorities had stepped efforts to 
halt political activism among Buddhist nuns.
