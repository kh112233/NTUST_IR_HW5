POLICE COMMITMENT STIRS APPRECIATION 
On June 26, officer Tommy De La Rosa was laid to rest. I didn't know him that 
well. Those who did used phrases such as "tough cop," "tender family man," 
"loyal friend and police officer." 
He was eulogized as a "good cop" committed to the welfare of others and the 
enforcement of the law. 
Peace officers swear an oath that involves the possibility of death -- they 
place the community's welfare above their own. 
Our society's support of individual freedom and self-determinism is a magnet to 
many in the world community. Though it is difficult, we constantly seek a 
balance between individual rights and majoritarian rights (public protection). 
Where millions of people coexist, the law defines the boundaries of individual 
freedom. Peace officers enforce these laws -- laws that allow us freedom yet 
restrict the infringement by others on that freedom. 
Police officers are cohesive force in our community -- laws and their 
enforcement make our quality of life possible. Peace officers help to hold our 
society together. 
After attending Tommy De La Rosa's memorial service, I was impressed by more 
than the familiar presence of authority. As the son of a retired Fullerton 
police officer, I've known cops all of my life. During the grieving and 
mourning, men and women -- as bighearted and human as any I've known -- said 
goodby to a fellow officer and reaffirmed their commitment to their duties. 
I appreciate that commitment, as do many others.
