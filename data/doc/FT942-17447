FT  05 APR 94 / US plans tight curb on salmon fishing
US fishery regulators will meet today in California to discuss a proposal
for an almost complete ban on Pacific salmon fishing this year.
The measure represents a drastic attempt to stem the decline in stocks of
Pacific salmon species such as coho, chinook and sockeye, which once
provided an apparently inexhaustible resource to the native American tribes
of the Pacific north-west.
The Pacific Fishery Management Council, a federal regulatory body, has
already imposed severe restrictions on commercial and sport fishing for
salmon but, at its meeting today near San Francisco, it will consider a
complete ban on ocean fishing in 1994, allowing only limited fishing inland.
But fishery experts say even these cuts in fishing would do little to save
the region's salmon stocks, many of which have been driven close to
extinction by logging, farming and construction damage to the streams in
which they spawn, as well as by the north-west's many dams, often without
fish ladders to enable the salmon to climb upstream.
Only the Snake River sockeye has been officially listed as an endangered
species, while the same river's chinook is listed as threatened.
But, according to a recent report compiled by the Wilderness Society, wild
salmon stocks in the Pacific north-west have fallen to 20 per cent of their
historical levels, and only pink salmon, among the region's ten major
species, are not in decline.
The Wilderness Society said coho, chum, sockeye and spring- and summer-run
chinook salmon, as well as summer-run steelhead and sea-run cutthroat trout,
are in danger across a wide area.
Autumn chinook and winter steelhead are in slightly better condition, but
are still threatened in much of California, southern Oregon and the Columbia
Basin.
