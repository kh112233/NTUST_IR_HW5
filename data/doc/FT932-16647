FT  05 APR 93 / Rallies in Northern Ireland and London
THOUSANDS of people demonstrated for peace in Ulster at rallies in Northern
Ireland and in London yesterday. The rallies came only hours after one
Britain's most wanted IRA suspects, Nessan Quinlivan, was arrested in
Nenagh, Co. Tipperary, Charles Batchelor writes.
Peace activist Susan McHugh took part in peace rallies in Belfast and at
London's Hyde Park (above), each attended by about 2,000 people, and called
for an end to terrorist violence. Mrs McHugh was at the centre of a
10,000-strong rally in Dublin last week after two children died in the
Warrington bombing.
Smaller peace rallies took place across Northern Ireland though up to 2,000
nationalists marched through West Belfast to protest against alleged
security force violence.
Meanwhile moves to extradite Mr Quinlivan, who broke out of Brixton Prison
in south London two years ago, are expected to start today.
