FT  09 SEP 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Method unearthed for drying
wood
Scientists at the University of St Andrews have developed a process, called
supercritical drying, to treat wooden objects after they are unearthed from
an archaeological excavation.
It involves soaking the wood in methanol to replace the water, after which
the wood is placed in a chamber containing carbon dioxide in the form of dry
ice. The methanol is then dissolved out of the wood by warming the carbon
dioxide to the point when it becomes a 'supercritical fluid'. In this state,
the carbon dioxide is a high pressure gas, which has the advantage that the
wood is not subjected to drying stresses when it is removed.
The university believes this system is an advance on conventional drying
methods, which involve impregnating the wood with polyethylene glycol. This
accelerates the corrosion of metals, making it unsuitable for objects made
from both wood and metal, such as knives.
