MORNING REPORT: ART 
Matisse Works Stolen: A cat burglar stole eight works by French master Henri 
Matisse worth $12.5 million from the artist's former apartment in Nice, police 
said Monday. The works include the celebrated oil paintings "View Over the Port 
of Collioure," "Woman in Brittany" and "Devilacqua." 
Police said the plush apartment located in the hills overlooking the 
Mediterranean was Matisse's home from 1938 until his death in 1954, but it had 
not been lived in regularly for more than 20 years. According to police 
sources, the apartment and paintings were bequeathed jointly to Matisse's 
heirs, who had been unable to agree on how the legacy should be divided. The 
painter's daughter-in-law, Maria Matisse, discovered the theft. The thief 
climbed up the front of the building, broke a window to get into the 
third-floor apartment and cut five oils, two pencil drawings and an etching 
from their frames, police said. The collection of works kept at the apartment 
are well known and police said it would be difficult for the thieves to sell 
them on the legitimate art market. Claudia Puig
