  [Text] Through Aviaco, the Spanish national airlines, Cuba 
has purchased eight planes, two of which are already in the 
country and soon to be put into service. 
  These are turbo-propelled, twin-engine planes with a 
functional capacity of between 44 and 48 passengers. The 
objective is to include them in the national and Caribbean 
routes. 
  The Cuban airline is responsible for tourism support and for 
Cuban national and international aviation, which are currently 
using Russian-made airplanes; that is, manufactured by the 
former Soviet Union. These planes are very safe, but they have 
been rendering service to the Cuban airlines for several years 
and we have been trying to find an alternative solution to these 
old Soviet-made planes so that national and international air 
transport will not be impaired by a gradual reduction of their 
service. 
  The Cuban airline intends to gradually replace these Russian 
airplanes by others which are more economic and more comfortable 
for passengers. These are Netherlands-made planes and their 
brand name is Fokker F-27-600. They are easily convertible from 
passenger to cargo planes. 
  Aviaco and Iberia cover all Spanish national routes.
