FT  25 APR 94 / Rwandan ceasefire delayed
A Rwandan government delegation said last night it had signed a ceasefire
agreement brokered by Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko but the rebel
Rwandan Patriotic Front (FPR) failed to attend the ceremony, Reuter reports
from Kinshasa.
The government signing came as doctors with the aid agency Medecins Sans
Frontiers said that 170 patients and staff had been slaughtered yesterday in
a hospital in Butare, southern Rwanda, in the civil war's latest massacre.
The agency said it was pulling out of the area.
The government delegation said the accord had previously been approved by
the FPR.
'We were surprised by the FPR's absence,' said Mr Andre Ntagerura, Rwandan
communications minister. 'We don't know why the FPR did not present itself.
We hope it was for reasons out of its control.'
Asked why the Rwandan government had failed to send a delegation to peace
talks scheduled to take place in Arusha, Tanzania this weekend, which were
attended by the FPR, Mr Ntagerura said the government had been plagued by
communications and transport problems.
He added that the FPR had gone to Arusha simply to make a declaration,
rather than actively negotiate peace.
The Zairean-brokered ceasefire was due to come into force yesterday. But Mr
Ntagerura said the Rwandan government considered the text would have to be
signed by both sides before it could be applied. Human rights workers
estimate 100,000 people have been killed and 2m displaced this month.
