METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 STYLISH SUSPECTS HELD IN BANK HOLDUPS 
Two men wearing "top of fashion" clothes were apprehended by police Tuesday 
after they allegedly held up two banks, one on Wilshire Boulevard and the other 
in Century City. 
"They were always wearing something at the top of fashion . . . , " said Los 
Angeles Police Detective Sgt. Jim Grayson. "(Tuesday) they wore black fedoras, 
silver-gray suits, white shirts and ties. 
The whole idea was to keep people from looking at their faces." 
One suspect, Kevin F. Stone, 28, was booked in the jail ward at County-USC 
Medical Center, where he was being treated for bites from a police dog who 
found him hiding behind a fence in West Los Angeles still holding a bag with 
$3,300 reportedly taken from a Wells Fargo office in Century City, Grayson 
said. The other suspect, Lawrence D. Griffey, 29, was captured by a motorcycle 
officer after a short chase. Grayson said Griffey had $700, believed taken from 
a Security Pacific office, in his socks.
