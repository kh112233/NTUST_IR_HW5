FIRE HITS ABORTION CLINIC BEFORE RULING 
A deliberately set fire caused minor damage to an abortion clinic Monday hours 
before the U.S. Supreme Court announced its ruling limiting the right to an 
abortion, authorities said. 
Police said they were notifying federal authorities because of the 
circumstances. 
"Where it's at a feminist health center and there's been this nationwide thing 
involving them (abortion clinics), we felt that we should notify them," said 
Jim Moran, director of investigations for the Concord police. 
Fire officials received an alarm at 2:20 a.m., said Capt. Jack Davis, fire 
prevention officer. The fire, confined to a bookcase in one room in the 
unoccupied building, was put out with a portable extinguisher.
