FT  12 JUN 93 / German party banned
Germany yesterday banned a fifth far right party, as arsonists struck at a
foreigners' hostel overnight and Turkish shops closed in protest against
racist attacks, Reuter reports. Police in Bavaria swooped on the National
Bloc, seizing propaganda, two loaded starting pistols and a baseball bat, an
Interior Ministry spokesman said.
