FT  08 APR 92 / Labour would forward sex-equality issues in EC
LABOUR would seek to put sex-equality issues at the top of the social and
employment agenda for the UK's six-month presidency of the European
Commission, which starts in July, Mr Tony Blair, employment spokesman, said
yesterday, Diane Summers writes.
Labour is committed to reversing the government's 'opt-out' from EC
employment legislation.
The party is also committed to introducing a Sex Equality Act, which would
combine sex discrimination and equal pay laws, and would introduce a right
to equal treatment.
The new law would require employers to prove that they were not
discriminating in equality cases before industrial tribunals, reversing the
current burden of proof.
Labour proposes to give part-time workers the same employment rights and the
same pay as full-time workers. Part-time workers currently enjoy employment
protection rights after five years, compared with two years for full-time
workers, and get reduced pension, redundancy and maternity benefits.
