FT  25 NOV 94 / United tourism plans for Ireland
The island of Ireland is to be promoted as a single tourist destination. The
initiative was unveiled yesterday by Baroness Denton, the Northern Ireland
economy minister, and Mr Charlie McCreevy, the Irish tourism minister, on
the back of the paramilitary ceasefire, John Murray Brown writes.
The joint initiative will target US and European markets in a Pounds 6.8m
marketing initiative which is expected to attract 92,000 extra visitors next
year.
Mr McCreevy was quick to stress that the project was being handled by the
tourism industry, not the respective governments. It will be funded by the
private sector, the International Fund for Ireland and the European Union.
Unionists in the north have in the past expressed opposition to any moves by
Dublin to exercise executive role in Ulster's affairs, even in
non-controversial areas.
