FT  07 AUG 92 / Islamic nations press UN
THE 46 members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) are
applying pressure on the UN Security Council to intervene militarily in
Bosnia-Hercegovina following an increase in fighting throughout the
republic.
The OIC, which recently formed a 'contact group' or lobby at the UN, wants
the Security Council to exempt Bosnia from the arms embargo, deploy more
military forces in the independent republic and step up humanitarian relief.
The lobby, which emerged from a June OIC meeting in Istanbul, is chaired by
Mr Mustfa Aksin, Turkey's UN ambassador, and includes Pakistan, Iran and
Egypt.
'We (the lobby) think the Security Council is not doing enough in trying to
stop the killing in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' a Turkish diplomat based in the US
said yesterday. He added that last Monday, it asked Daoyu Li, the (Chinese)
president of the Security Council, to adopt a much tougher resolution in
defence of Bosnia's Moslem population.
In their effort to seek assistance from the Islamic world, Bosnia's Moslems,
who are Sunni, and Slav, have to play a delicate balancing act.
They cannot afford to receive support from any fundamentalist Shia movements
because that would give credibility to Serbian propaganda that the Moslems
are intent on setting up an Islamic fundamentalist state in Bosnia, a claim
denied by Bosnian officials. But the longer the war continues in Bosnia, and
the longer the international community hesitates in taking military action,
the more likely it is that sections of the Moslem community will be further
radicalised.
