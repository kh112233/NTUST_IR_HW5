FT  05 DEC 94 / Arts (Openings): Munich
An exhibition opening on Wednesday at the Lenbachhaus aims to speed up the
rehabilitation of Helmut Kolle (1899-1931), the German figurative artist who
flourished in Paris in the 1920s. His early death, together with the theft
and destruction of many of his paintings during the Nazi era, led to his
neglect after the war.
